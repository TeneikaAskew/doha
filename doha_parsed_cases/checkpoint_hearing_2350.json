The SOR 1.a allegations was cross-alleged under Guideline J (SOR 2.a) and Guideline E (SOR 3.a). Under Guideline F, the Government alleged that Applicant owed $25,413 for three delinquent or past-due debts (SOR 4.a \u2013 4.c); and that he did not file as required his federal (SOR 4.d) and state (SOR 4.e) income tax returns for the 2017 tax year. In response to the SOR (Answer), Applicant denied with explanation the allegation at SOR 1.a, and by reference, the SOR 2.a and 3.a allegations. He denied with explanations and supporting documents all of the Guideline F allegations.

The guidelines cited in the SOR were included \nin the adjudicative guidelines (AG) issued by the Director of National Intelligence on \nDecember 10, 2016, to be effective for all adjudications on or after June 8, 2017. \nApplicant timely responded to the SOR (Answer) and requested a hearing before \nan administrative judge from the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA). The \ncase was first assigned to me in March 2020. A timely hearing could not be scheduled \nbecause Applicant was due to undergo orthopedic surgery that required extensive \nrehabilitation. Thereafter, scheduling was delayed for reasons related to the COVID-19 \npandemic. On November 19, 2021, I scheduled a hearing for December 14, 2021. On \nDecember 7, 2021, Applicant requested a continuance so he could retain legal counsel. \nI granted his request. \nOn February 24, 2022, Applicant advised me that he had not retained counsel, but \nthat he was prepared to proceed pro se. I scheduled a hearing by video teleconference \nfor March 14, 2022. The parties appeared as scheduled. Department Counsel produced \nGovernment Exhibits (GX) 1 \u2013 5, to which Applicant did not object. Additionally, a copy of \na discovery letter dated March 11, 2020, and a list of the Government\u2019s exhibits are \nincluded in the record as Hearing Exhibits (HX) 1 and 2, respectively. Applicant testified \nand produced Applicant Exhibits (AX) A and B, to which Department Counsel did not \nobject. The record closed at the end of the hearing and I received a transcript of the \nhearing (Tr.) on March 28, 2022. \nFindings of Fact \nUnder Guideline D, the Government alleged that in November 2017, Applicant was \narrested and charged with forcible sexual assault, pleaded guilty to a different included \ncharge, was ordered to register as a sex offender, and will be on supervised probation \nuntil November 2022 (SOR 1.a). The SOR 1.a allegations was cross-alleged under \nGuideline J (SOR 2.a) and Guideline E (SOR 3.a). \nUnder Guideline F, the Government alleged that Applicant owed $25,413 for three \ndelinquent or past-due debts (SOR 4.a \u2013 4.c); and that he did not file as required his \nfederal (SOR 4.d) and state (SOR 4.e) income tax returns for the 2017 tax year. \nIn response to the SOR (Answer), Applicant denied with explanation the allegation \nat SOR 1.a, and by reference, the SOR 2.a and 3.a allegations. He denied with \nexplanations and supporting documents all of the Guideline F allegations. (Answer) After \nreviewing the pleadings, as well as the testimony and exhibits produced at hearing, I \nmake the following findings of fact. \nApplicant is 54 years old. He and his wife have been married since May 1989 and \nthey have two grown children. Applicant served on active duty in the United States Army \nfrom July 1986 until retiring as a senior non-commissioned officer (NCO) in October 2010. \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \nWhile on active duty, he deployed at least four times to combat zones in Afghanistan, \nIraq, and elsewhere. Applicant has a 100 percent disability rating from the Department of \nVeterans Affairs (VA). His service-related disabilities include post-traumatic stress \ndisorder (PTSD). After retiring from the Army in 2010, Applicant was hired by a defense \ncontractor for work on a training contract. He has continued to do the same work, but for \ndifferent employers, as each company succeeded the other in winning the contract for \nthat work. Applicant has worked for his current employer since at least 2019; however, \nhe has been unable to work since early 2020 pending final adjudication of his security \nclearance. Applicant has held a security clearance at various levels of access since early \nin his Army career. (GX 1; GX 2; AX B; Tr. 34 \u2013 35, 48 \u2013 50) \nApplicant has lived and worked in State A since at least 2010. In November 2017, \nApplicant was sent to a military facility in State B on temporary duty. He once had been \nassigned in that area of State B while on active duty and took advantage of the \nassignment to visit some old familiar places while there. One of those places was a \nnightclub where he decided to take in a band that was playing there. In trying to cope with \nPTSD, Applicant had not consumed alcohol for almost a year prior; however, at the \nnightclub on the night of November 16, 2017, Applicant had four mixed drinks and two \nshots of tequila. That evening he also met a woman (J) who went with Applicant back to \nhis hotel room where they had sex. Applicant claimed, in his PSI and during his testimony, \nthat J did not want to go home because her boyfriend would be mad for some reason. \nWhereupon, Applicant offered to take J to his hotel room. When they got there, they \nengaged in what he insists was consensual sex. (Answer; GX 2; GX 3) \nDuring his personal subject interview (PSI) with a government investigator on \nFebruary 22, 2019, Applicant stated he did not see J drink at the nightclub, that he did \nnot smell alcohol on her breath, and that she did not appear to him to be impaired. He \nalso stated that he believed she was able to consent to having sex with him and that they \nengaged in consensual sex that evening. However, at hearing, he testified that he noticed \nher eyes were \u201cglassy\u201d before they went to his hotel room. He further acknowledged that \nshe may have been under the influence of something other than alcohol and that such an \nimpairment could render J unable to knowingly consent to having sex with him. \nApplicant\u2019s sexual encounter with J was not the first time he had engaged in extra-marital \nsexual relations. (GX 2; Tr. 28 \u2013 29, 33, 56 \u2013 57) \nIn his PSI, Applicant stated that after he and J finished having sex, she quickly \ngathered her things and left. He further averred that he went to work the next day, but \nwhen he returned the local police were waiting for him. J had apparently told the hotel \nfront desk on her way out the night before that she had been raped. Applicant did not \nexplain why police were not called when she reported what had happened. Indeed, court \nrecords produced by the Government show an arrest on November 17, 2017, at 12:45 \na.m. (GX 3 at p. 2) After questioning Applicant about what had happened, the police \narrested him and charged him with felony sexual assault by force or submission. Because \nit was the Thanksgiving holiday, Applicant spent five days in jail before he could obtain \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \nbail. He notified his employer upon his release from jail about what had happened, hired \na local attorney, then returned home to State A. (GX 2; Tr. 26 \u2013 27) \nIn October 2018, Applicant agreed to a plea deal whereby he pleaded guilty to a \nlesser included felony of sexual assault on a person whose ability to consent is impaired \nby drugs or alcohol. He testified that he would have preferred to go to trial, especially \nbecause it was doubtful J would have appeared to testify. He averred that she was in \ndrug rehab in another state around the time the trial would have started. He was ordered \nto complete sex offender counseling, register in State B as a sex offender, and assessed \n$5,650 in court costs. Applicant was also placed on probation until November 2022. His \nprobation is still in place and requires him to report to a probation officer each month. \nApplicant is no longer on the sex offender registry in either State A or B. Applicant\u2019s wife \nis aware of his arrest, but it is not clear from this record if his wife knows about his other \nextra-marital affairs. Applicant claims their marriage is now much stronger for having \nworked through this issue. He also is more dedicated to his religious beliefs and he has \ncompletely stopped drinking. (GX 2; GX 3; Tr. 29 \u2013 33) \nApplicant claims he accepted the plea deal because he did not think he could get \na fair trial given prevailing public opinion in State B in response to national news reports \nof sexual mistreatment of women. He also did not want to continue paying legal fees \nbecause, before his arrest he already was dealing with financial difficulties in the form of \npast-due or delinquent credit cards. He had paid off most of his debts and did not have \nsufficient cash on hand to pay his lawyer out of pocket. The three credit card debts alleged \nin the SOR were incurred during the summer of 2019 as he used them to pay his legal \nfees. In response to the SOR and at his hearing, Applicant established that he has repaid \nthose three debts, and that he has finished repaying his older debts, by obtaining a debt \nconsolidation loan and by refinancing the mortgage on his house with an equity cash-out \nof about $29,000. (Answer; GX 2 \u2013 5; AX A; Tr. 29 \u2013 31, 35 \u2013 40) \nAs alleged at SOR 4.d and 4.e, Applicant did not timely file his state or federal \nincome tax returns for the 2017 tax year. In response, Applicant provided information that \nestablished his failure to file was inadvertent \u2013 the result of miscommunication with the \ntax preparer he was using at the time. He filed the returns as soon as he learned of the \ndiscrepancy and established repayment plans for any taxes owed. (Answer; Tr. 40 \u2013 43) \nApplicant\u2019s current finances appear stable. He has not incurred any new unpaid \ndebts. In addition to his defense contractor income, his wife earns money through part-\ntime employment, and he receives recently-increased VA disability benefits, Social \nSecurity benefits, and military retired pay. His total household income after deductions is \nestimated at $10,000 monthly, which provides Applicant and his wife ample positive cash \nflow each month.

(See Directive, 6.3) Decisions must also reflect consideration of the \nfactors listed in \u00b6 2(d) of the guidelines. Commonly referred to as the \u201cwhole-person\u201d \nconcept, those factors are: \n(1) The nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nThe presence or absence of a disqualifying or mitigating condition is not \ndeterminative of a conclusion for or against an applicant. However, specific applicable \nguidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against them as they \nrepresent policy guidance governing the grant or denial of access to classified \ninformation. A security clearance decision is intended only to resolve whether it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest for an applicant to either receive or continue to have \naccess to classified information. (See Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518) \nThe Government bears the initial burden of producing admissible information on \nwhich it based the preliminary decision to deny or revoke a security clearance for an \napplicant. Additionally, the Government must be able to prove controverted facts alleged \nin the SOR. If the Government meets its burden, it then falls to the applicant to refute, \nextenuate or mitigate the Government\u2019s case. Because no one has a \u201cright\u201d to a security \nclearance, an applicant bears a heavy burden of persuasion. (See Egan, 484 U.S. at 528, \n531) A person who has access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship \nwith the Government based on trust and confidence. Thus, the Government has a \ncompelling interest in ensuring each applicant possesses the requisite judgment, \nreliability and trustworthiness of one who will protect the national interests as his or her \nown. The \u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d standard compels resolution of any \nreasonable doubt about an applicant\u2019s suitability for access in favor of the Government. \n(See Egan; AG \u00b6 2(b)) \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \nAnalysis \nSexual Behavior \nApplicant denied that he was charged as alleged at SOR 1.a; however, the \nGovernment supported that allegation with sufficient reliable information that showed \nApplicant was arrested and charged with forcible sexual assault. That information further \nshowed Applicant pleaded guilty to a lesser included felony offense of sexual assault that \nfocused on whether J was able to consent to having sex with Applicant. The record also \nshows that Applicant committed adultery when he had sex with J, and that he had \nengaged in extra-marital sex on other occasions. It is not clear from this record if his wife \nand others close to him are fully aware of the scope of his sexual misconduct. Available \ninformation reasonably raises a security concern about sexual behavior that is articulated, \nin relevant part, at AG \u00b6 12: \nSexual behavior that involves a criminal offense; reflects a lack of judgment \nor discretion; or may subject the individual to undue influence of coercion, \nexploitation, or duress. These issues, together or individually, may raise \nquestions about an individual's judgment, reliability, trustworthiness, and \nability to protect classified or sensitive information. . . . \nMore specifically, the Government\u2019s information supports application of the \ndisqualifying conditions at AG \u00b6\u00b6 13(a) (sexual behavior of a criminal nature, whether or \nnot the individual has been prosecuted); 13(c) (sexual behavior that causes an individual \nto be vulnerable to coercion, exploitation, or duress); and 13(d) (sexual behavior of a \npublic nature or that reflects lack of discretion or judgment). I also have considered all of \nthe following AG \u00b6 14 mitigating conditions: \n(a) the behavior occurred prior to or during adolescence and there is no \nevidence of subsequent conduct of a similar nature; \n(b) the sexual behavior happened so long ago, so infrequently, or under \nsuch unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or judgment; \n(c) the behavior no longer serves as a basis for coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; \n(d) the sexual behavior is strictly private, consensual, and discreet; and \n(e) the individual has successfully completed an appropriate program of \ntreatment, or is currently enrolled in one, has demonstrated ongoing and \nconsistent compliance with the treatment plan, and/or has received a \nfavorable prognosis from a qualified mental health professional indicating \nthe behavior is readily controllable with treatment. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe mitigating condition at AG \u00b6 14(a) does not pertain to these circumstances as \nApplicant\u2019s conduct occurred as a fully-formed adult. As to AG \u00b6 14(c), while Applicant\u2019s \nwife and employer are aware of his arrest, it is unclear from the record if his wife is aware \nof his other extra-marital activities. This mitigating condition cannot be fully applied unless \nit is established that, at the very least, those closest to Applicant are fully informed about \nhis conduct. As to AG \u00b6 14(e), Applicant completed court-ordered counseling after his \narrest; however, available information does not reflect the results of that counseling or \nany prognosis, favorable or otherwise. This mitigating condition cannot be fully applied. \nAG \u00b6 14(b) does not apply because of Applicant\u2019s acknowledgment that he also \nengaged extra-marital affairs before his arrest. He greatly exacerbated those exploits by \nhaving sex with a person who was unable to fully consent to having sex, because one \nmust ask if other women with whom he committed adultery were likewise impaired. Even \nthough the events discussed in this case are more than three years old, they are not \nisolated and did not occur under unusual circumstances. \nFinally, AG \u00b6 14(d) does not apply because his conduct in November 2017 was \nnot consensual. J may not have been intoxicated by alcohol when she had sex with \nApplicant, but Applicant observed that her eyes were \u201cglassy\u201d before they went back to \nhis hotel room and acknowledged that she may have been impaired by some substance \nother than alcohol that night. On balance, I conclude that Applicant did not mitigate the \nsecurity concerns raised by the Government\u2019s information under this guideline. \nCriminal Conduct \nThe Government established that Applicant was arrested and pleaded guilty to a \nfelony sexual assault charge in State B. He is still on supervised probation as part of his \nsentence for that offense. This information is sufficient to raise the security concern about \ncriminal conduct as articulated at AG \u00b6 30: \nCriminal activity creates doubt about a person's judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person's ability or \nwillingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations. \nAvailable information supports application of the disqualifying conditions at AG \u00b6\u00b6 \n31(b) (evidence (including, but not limited to, a credible allegation, an admission, and \nmatters of official record) of criminal conduct, regardless of whether the individual was \nformally charged, prosecuted, or convicted) and 31(c) (individual is currently on parole or \nprobation). I also considered the following AG \u00b6 32 mitigating conditions: \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur and \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(b) the individual was pressured or coerced into committing the act and \nthose pressures are no longer present in the person's life; \n(c) no reliable evidence to support that the individual committed the offense; \nand \n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including, but not limited \nto, the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, restitution, \ncompliance with the terms of parole or probation, job training or higher \neducation, \ngood \nemployment \nrecord, \nor \nconstructive \ncommunity \ninvolvement. \nFor the same reasons I declined to apply Guideline D mitigating condition AG \u00b6 \n14(b), AG \u00b6 32(a) does not apply under this guideline. As to AG \u00b6 32(b), there is no \ninformation that suggests Applicant was pressured or coerced into acting as he did the \nnight he was arrested. Further, Applicant\u2019s conviction of a felony charge precludes any \nclaim that there is no reliable evidence that Applicant committed the offense at issue here. \nAG \u00b6 32(c) does not apply. \nFinally, as to rehabilitation, in addition to the reasons I cited for not applying AG \u00b6 \n14(e), above, I cannot conclude that Applicant is rehabilitated because he is still on \nprobation. Even though Applicant is nearing the end of that aspect of his sentence, he did \nnot provide any input from his probation officer about Applicant\u2019s compliance with the \nterms of his probation or that confirms Applicant will, in fact, be released from probation \nas scheduled. Additionally, Applicant\u2019s version of events regarding the night of his \ninteraction with J and the sequence of events surrounding his actual arrest, as well as his \ninitial denial that he was charged as documented in the Government\u2019s information, do not \nadd up. It strains credulity that a person would stop at the hotel desk to report she had \nbeen raped, but the police would not confront Applicant until late the next day. Applicant\u2019s \nversion of events also appears to be inconsistent with the chronological court record \nproduced by the Government. As a result, I have concerns about Applicant\u2019s credibility, \nand, concurrently, about his judgment and reliability. On balance, even though his 2017 \narrest is isolated and more than three years old, Applicant did not meet his burden of \nproducing information sufficient to mitigate the security concerns raised by the \nGovernment\u2019s information under this guideline. \nPersonal Conduct \nApplicant was arrested for misconduct that reflects poor judgment and a lack of \ndiscretion. It reasonably raises a security concern about personal conduct that is \narticulated, in relevant part, at AG \u00b6 15: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. \nMore specifically, available information supports application of the following AG \u00b6 \n16 disqualifying conditions: \n(c) credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is \nnot sufficient for an adverse determination under any other single guideline, \nbut which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-person \nassessment of questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack \nof candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations, or other \ncharacteristics indicating that the individual may not properly safeguard \nclassified or sensitive information; and \n(e) personal conduct, or concealment of information about one's conduct, \nthat creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress by a \nforeign intelligence entity or other individual or group. Such conduct \nincludes: (1) engaging in activities which, if known, could affect the person's \npersonal, professional, or community standing . . . . \nApplicant\u2019s conduct is sufficient for disqualification under Guidelines D and J as \ndiscussed above; however, the adverse effects of Applicant\u2019s sexual behavior and arrest \non his suitability for clearance are most acute when assessing his overall judgment and \ntrustworthiness. His lack of credibility regarding the circumstances surrounding his arrest \nundermines confidence in his truthfulness and precludes an affirmative finding that the \nSOR allegations no longer are an accurate reflection of his personal conduct. As for the \napplication of AG \u00b6 16(e), Applicant has not established that this conduct is not a source \nof potential vulnerability. It is not known from this record if even those closest to Applicant \nare fully aware of his conduct and the circumstances surrounding his arrest. Finally, his \nlack of credibility regarding the circumstances surrounding his arrest undermines \nconfidence in his truthfulness and precludes an affirmative finding that the SOR \nallegations no longer are an accurate reflection of his personal conduct. \nI also considered the following AG \u00b6 17 mitigating conditions: \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; \n(b) the refusal or failure to cooperate, omission, or concealment was caused \nor significantly contributed to by advice of legal counsel or of a person with \nprofessional responsibilities for advising or instructing the individual \nspecifically concerning security processes. Upon being made aware of the \nrequirement to cooperate or provide the information, the individual \ncooperated fully and truthfully; \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, \nunreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to \nrecur; \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate vulnerability \nto exploitation, manipulation, or duress; \n(f) the information was unsubstantiated or from a source of questionable \nreliability; and \n(g) association with persons involved in criminal activities was unwitting, \nhas ceased, or occurs under circumstances that do not cast doubt upon the \nindividual's reliability, trustworthiness, judgment, or willingness to comply \nwith rules and regulations. \nThe mitigating conditions at AG \u00b6\u00b6 17(a), 17(b), 17(f) and 17(g) are not pertinent \nto the facts and circumstances presented here. As to AG \u00b6 17(c), the offense for which \nApplicant was arrested was not minor. It was a felony to which he pleaded guilty. The \nlength of his probation reflects the court\u2019s view of the seriousness of the offense. For \nreasons already stated, above, Applicant\u2019s misconduct continues to reflect adversely on \nhis reliability and judgment. AG \u00b6 17(c) does not apply. \nAs to AG \u00b6 17(d), Applicant is still on probation and he did not provide sufficient \ninformation about counseling or about the likelihood he will be released from probation \nlater this year. AG \u00b6 17(d) does not apply based on available information. Applicant also \ndid not, as discussed above, present sufficient information that shows those closest to \nhim are fully aware of the full extent of his sexual conduct. That circumstance could leave \nApplicant vulnerable to pressure or coercion by others seeking to leverage his access to \nsensitive information. There is no indication that Applicant has acted to address that \npossibility. AG \u00b6 17(e) does not apply. On balance, I conclude Applicant has not mitigated \nthe security concerns under this guideline that reasonably arise from the Government\u2019s \ninformation. \nFinancial Considerations \nThe Government presented sufficient reliable information showing that Applicant \nowed just over $25,000 for three delinquent credit card accounts and that he had not filed \n10 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nhis state or federal income tax returns for 2017. Additionally, Applicant was already \nexperiencing financial problems before his arrest. The need to pay for legal fees only \nexacerbated his inability to meet his financial obligations. This information reasonably \nraises a security concern about Applicant\u2019s finances that is articulated at AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. \nMore specifically, available information supports application of the following AG \u00b6 \n19 disqualifying conditions: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired. \nIn response to the SOR and at hearing, Applicant established that his failure to file \nhis 2017 tax returns was due to circumstances beyond his control and that he acted \nresponsibly thereafter. Applicant\u2019s tax preparer did not file those returns as expected, but \nApplicant filed them as soon as he became aware of that problem. He has addressed his \ntax reporting payment issues satisfactorily. He also established that he has paid or \notherwise resolved the delinquencies alleged in the SOR. He did so by using his savings \nand the proceeds of a cash-out refinancing of the mortgage on his home. His current \nfinances appear sound and he has not incurred any new past-due or delinquent \nobligations. \nBased on all of the foregoing, I considered application of the following AG \u00b6 20 \nmitigating conditions: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \n11 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue; \n(f) the affluence resulted from a legal source of income; and \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority \nto file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 20(e) and 20(f) are not pertinent to the facts and circumstances of this case. \nAG \u00b6 20(c) does not apply because Applicant did not present information showing he had \nengaged in any financial counseling or other professional financial assistance to resolve \nhis debts. AG \u00b6 20(b) does not apply because Applicant\u2019s debts alleged in the SOR were \ncaused by the legal fees he incurred after he was arrested in 2017. As such, the debts \ndirectly resulted from his own poor judgment and misconduct. Available information \nshows that Applicant began trying to resolve the debts alleged in the SOR before he \nreceived the SOR, and as already noted, his debts have been resolved. AG \u00b6 20(d) \napplies. AG \u00b6 20(f) applies because Applicant filed his 2017 income tax returns not long \nafter he became aware they had not been filed as he had expected. SOR 4.d and 4.e are \nresolved for Applicant. \nAs to the delinquent debts alleged at SOR 4.a \u2013 4.c, those financial problems are \ndirectly tied to the defects in his personal conduct, judgment, and trustworthiness. As \nsuch, his debts cannot be viewed in piecemeal fashion separately from the security \nconcerns under the other adjudicative guidelines at issue in this case. Just as the \npresence of unresolved debts is not dispositive of financial security concerns, so, too, the \nfact that Applicant has resolved his debts does not insulate his suitability for clearance \nfrom further scrutiny. Because the underlying concerns about his judgment remain \nunresolved, I cannot conclude that the concerns about his financial problems have not \nbeen mitigated. \n12 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                        \n \n \n \nI also have evaluated this record in the context of the whole-person factors listed \nat AG \u00b6 2(d). Applicant presented information showing he has resolved his financial \nproblems; however, those problems directly resulted from or were exacerbated by his \nown failure in judgment and trustworthiness that led to his arrest in 2017. Concerns \nremain about Applicant\u2019s vulnerability to coercion because of his misconduct, and the fact \nthat he repeatedly violated his wife\u2019s trust prior to his arrest severely undermines \nconfidence in his character and reliability. In summary, doubts about his suitability for \naccess to classified information persist. Because protection of the national interest is the \nparamount concern in these adjudications, those doubts must be resolved against \nApplicant. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required by section \nE3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline D: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline J: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 2.a: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 3, Guideline E: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 3.a: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 4, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 4.a \u2013 4.c: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 4.d \u2013 4.e: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the foregoing, it is not clearly consistent with the interests of national \nsecurity for Applicant to have access to classified information. Applicant\u2019s request for a \nsecurity clearance is denied. \nMATTHEW E. MALONE \nAdministrative Judge \n13 \n",

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant is a 62-year-old employee of a defense contractor. She has worked for her current employer or a predecessor defense contractor since 2011. She has worked on the same military facility since at least 1993. She seeks to retain a security clearance, which she has held for more than 20 years. She is a high school graduate. She has never married, and she has no children. Applicant has a history of tax issues. She did not file her federal and state income tax returns for tax years 2010 through 2021. She reported her failure to file her tax returns from 2011 to 2014 on a Questionnaire for National Security Positions (SF 86) that she submitted in November 2016. She wrote that she did not file the 2011 returns because she did not have the $100 that she believed she would owe. She stated that she did not file the later returns because she lost her W-2 forms when she moved, and she did not know where to start to file the returns. She stated that she would need to get replacement W-2 forms. She provided similar information when she was interviewed for her background investigation in August 2018. Applicant responded to interrogatories in January 2020. She reported that she had not filed federal and state tax returns from 2010 through 2018. The interrogatories informed her how to obtain transcripts from the IRS for 2010 through 2018. She provided IRS wage and income transcripts for those years.

Applicant testified at her initial hearing and reconvened hearing, but she did \nnot submit any documentary evidence at either hearing. \nMotion to Amend SOR \nDepartment Counsel\u2019s motion to amend SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b by changing \u201c2018\u201d \nto \u201c2021\u201d was granted over Applicant\u2019s objection. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant is a 62-year-old employee of a defense contractor. She has worked for \nher current employer or a predecessor defense contractor since 2011. She has worked \non the same military facility since at least 1993. She seeks to retain a security \nclearance, which she has held for more than 20 years. She is a high school graduate. \nShe has never married, and she has no children. \nApplicant has a history of tax issues. She did not file her federal and state\nincome tax returns for tax years 2010 through 2021. She reported her failure to file her \ntax returns from 2011 to 2014 on a Questionnaire for National Security Positions (SF \n86) that she submitted in November 2016. She wrote that she did not file the 2011 \nreturns because she did not have the $100 that she believed she would owe. She \nstated that she did not file the later returns because she lost her W-2 forms when she \nmoved, and she did not know where to start to file the returns. She stated that she \nwould need to get replacement W-2 forms. She provided similar information when she \nwas interviewed for her background investigation in August 2018. \n \nApplicant responded to interrogatories in January 2020. She reported that she \nhad not filed federal and state tax returns from 2010 through 2018. The interrogatories \ninformed her how to obtain transcripts from the IRS for 2010 through 2018. She \nprovided IRS wage and income transcripts for those years. The transcripts include \nApplicant\u2019s W-2 wage and tax statements for those years. She wrote: \u201cI do not know \nhow to fill out the 1040 form correctly. I am seeking help for this. It is my hope that there \nwill be someone to help as tax \u2018season\u2019 is approaching soon.\u201d \nApplicant admitted the SOR allegations in January 2021. She testified during her \nfirst hearing that she retained a tax preparer to file the returns, but the preparer did not \nfile them because Applicant did not provide her recent W-2 forms. She had not been in \ncontact with the preparer in some time. She provided additional explanations as to why \nshe has not filed the returns during both hearings. Essentially the process is \noverwhelming for her, and she cannot afford to pay anyone to help her.

She was unable to provide any timeline as to when the \nreturns will be filed. \nPolicies \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG), which became \neffective on June 8, 2017. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n3 \n\n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds.  \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. The following is potentially applicable in this case: \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired. \nApplicant did not file her 2010 through 2021 federal and state income tax returns. \nAG \u00b6 19(f) is applicable. \nConditions that could mitigate the financial considerations security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 20. The following are potentially applicable: \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the\nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; and \n \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax \nauthority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \nApplicant has not filed federal and state income tax returns for more than a \ndecade. She has been aware since at least 2016 that her taxes were of interest to the \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nDOD. Her initial explanation was that she did not file the 2011 returns because she did \nnot have the $100 that she believed she would owe. She then stated that she moved \nand lost her W-2 forms in a move. She testified during her first hearing that she retained \na tax preparer to file the returns, but the preparer did not file them because Applicant \ndid not provide her recent W-2 forms. Her recent explanations were essentially that the \nprocess is overwhelming for her, and she cannot afford to pay anyone to help her. After \nmore than a decade, those excuses start to ring hollow. The returns remain unfiled. \nThere are no applicable mitigating conditions. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n(1) The nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. \nApplicant has not filed federal and state income tax returns for more than a \ndecade. Failure to comply with tax laws suggests that an applicant has a problem with \nabiding by well-established government rules and systems. Voluntary compliance with \nrules and systems is essential for protecting classified information. See, e.g., ISCR \nCase No. 16-01726 at 5 (App. Bd. Feb. 28, 2018). A person who fails repeatedly to fulfill \nhis or her legal obligations, such as filing tax returns and paying taxes when due, does \nnot demonstrate the high degree of good judgment and reliability required of those \ngranted access to classified information. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 17-01382 at 4 (App. \nBd. May 16, 2018). \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude Applicant did not \nmitigate the financial considerations security concerns. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.b: \n \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIt is not clearly consistent with the national interest to continue Applicant\u2019s \neligibility for a security clearance.

Applicant pays child support totaling approximately $800 a \nmonth for two of his biological children who live with their mothers. (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit \nA.) Applicant fell in child support arrears in the amount of $18,000 on one account, and \n$11,000 on another account. \nTo resolve the debt arrearage, he borrowed \napproximately $30,000 from his 401k, and brought the debt current. \n(Government \nExhibit 4.) \nAlthough Applicant has maintained steady employment over the years, there \nwere times when he did not earn enough money to support he and his wife\u2019s spending \nhabits.

(Tr. pp. 46-49.) \nThe following delinquent debts are of security concern: \n1.a. Applicant is indebted to a creditor in the amount of $18,779 (the balance \nowed) for an account that was charged off for the purchase of a motorcycle in 2015 that \nhe was financing. Applicant returned the motorcycle after a year. (Tr. p. 36.) Applicant \nhas not yet contacted the creditor about this debt, but states that he plans to do so. The \ndebt remains owing. \n1.b. Applicant is indebted to a creditor in the amount of $589 for an account that \nwas placed for collection. \nThis was an old credit card. \nApplicant claims that he \nremembered paying it off over the telephone. \n(Tr. pp. 40-41.) \nHe provided no \ndocumentation to support his testimony. The debt remains owing. \n1.c. Applicant was indebted to a creditor in the amount of $90 for an account that \nwas placed for collection. This was a pest control service account that was outstanding. \nApplicant has paid the debt in full. (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit B, and Tr. pp. 26 and 42-43.) \n1.d. Applicant was indebted to a creditor in the amount of $52 for an account that \nwas placed for collection. \nThis was a bottled water account. Applicant has paid the \ndebt in full.  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit C and Tr. p. 27 and Tr. pp. 43-44.) \n1.e. Applicant is indebted to a creditor in the amount of $454 for an account that \nwas placed for collection. This was a debt to a jewelry store. Applicant does not know \nthe status of the debt. (Tr. pp. 45-46.) The debt remains owing. \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nconjunction with the factors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. The entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of \nvariables known as the whole-person concept. The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance \ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to \npotential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F - Financial Considerations \nThe security concern for Financial Considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n   \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. Two are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant has a history of financial hardship. \nHis actions or inactions both \ndemonstrate a history of not addressing his debt and/or an inability to do so. The \nevidence is sufficient to raise the above disqualifying conditions. \nThe following mitigating conditions under the Financial Considerations guideline \nare potentially applicable under AG \u00b6 20. \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g. loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce, or \nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and  \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \nApplicant has incurred delinquent debt that he still has not paid. Applicant\u2019s \nfinancial irresponsibility and inaction for so long casts doubt on his current reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment. Applicant appears to want to resolve his debt but \nhas work to do to achieve this. At this time, Applicant needs more time to show the \nGovernment that he will properly resolve his financial delinquencies with regular \nsystematic payments and consistency. None of the mitigating conditions are applicable. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThere is insufficient evidence in the record to show that Applicant has made a \ngood faith effort to resolve his debts. Overall, Applicant shows little progress towards \nresolving his debts. He paid two small debts, and has no knowledge of another debt. \nHe still owes a significant amount of money to one of his creditors and has made no \neffort to resolve the debt. There is insufficient evidence in the record to show that the \nApplicant has carried his burden of proof to establish mitigation of the government \nsecurity concerns under Guideline F. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nIn the event that \nApplicant follows through with his commitment to show financial responsibility, \nsometime in the future he may be found to be sufficiently reliable to properly protect and \naccess classified information. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nrelevant facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I conclude Applicant has not \nmitigated the Financial Considerations security concern. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a., 1.b., and 1.e.   \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.c., and 1.d. \n \n \nFor Applicant  \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for \na security clearance.

This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nabout potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Clearance \ndecisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a \ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See Exec.

It is merely an indication the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the \nPresident, Secretary of Defense, and Director of National Intelligence have established \nfor issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro.

Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nThe Appeal Board explained the scope and rationale for the financial \nconsiderations security concern in ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012) \n(citation omitted) as follows: \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an applicant might \nknowingly compromise classified information in order to raise money in \nsatisfaction of his or her debts. Rather, it requires a Judge to examine the \ntotality of an applicant\u2019s financial history and circumstances. The Judge \nmust consider pertinent evidence regarding the applicant\u2019s self-control, \njudgment, and other qualities essential to protecting the national secrets as \nwell as the vulnerabilities inherent in the circumstances. The Directive \npresumes a nexus between proven conduct under any of the Guidelines \nand an applicant\u2019s security eligibility. \nAG \u00b6 19 includes one disqualifying condition that could raise a security concern \nand may be disqualifying in this case: \u201c(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, \nstate, or local income tax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax as required.\u201d The record establishes AG \u00b6 19(f). Discussion of this disqualifying \ncondition is contained in the mitigation section, infra. \nThe financial considerations mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are as follows: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control;  \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts;   \n5 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue; \n(f) the affluence resulted from a legal source of income; and \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority \nto file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \nIn ISCR Case No. 10-04641 at 4 (App. Bd. Sept. 24, 2013), the DOHA Appeal \nBoard explained Applicant\u2019s responsibility for proving the applicability of mitigating \nconditions as follows: \nOnce a concern arises regarding an applicant\u2019s security clearance eligibility, \nthere is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance of a security \nclearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th Cir. 1990), \ncert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991). After the Government presents evidence \nraising security concerns, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut or \nmitigate those concerns. See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. The standard applicable \nin security clearance decisions is that articulated in Egan, supra. \u201cAny doubt \nconcerning personnel being considered for access to classified information \nwill be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d Directive, Enclosure 2 \u00b6 \n2(b).  \nApplicant indicated four circumstances beyond his control adversely affected his \nfinances: (1) an automobile accident in September 2016; (2) water damage to his house; \n(3) a fire in his house; and (4) deaths in his family. However, he does not receive full \nmitigating credit because he failed to prove he was unable with due diligence to file \noverdue tax returns for TYs 2016 and 2017. He admitted that he procrastinated in the \nfiling of his tax returns. \nApplicant failed to timely file his federal and state income tax returns for tax years \n(TY) 2016 and 2017. He estimated that he owed $3,000 to the federal government for \nthose two tax years, and he did not owe anything to the state government. \nA willful failure to timely make (means complete and file with the IRS) a federal \nincome tax return is a misdemeanor-level federal criminal offense. Title 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7203, \nwillful failure to file return, supply information, or pay tax, reads: \nAny person . . . required by this title or by regulations made under authority \nthereof to make a return, keep any records, or supply any information, who \nwillfully fails to . . . make such return, keep such records, or supply such \ninformation, at the time or times required by law or regulations, shall, in \naddition to other penalties provided by law, be guilty of a misdemeanor . . . . \n6 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nA willful failure to make return, keep records, or supply information when required, \nis a misdemeanor without regard to the existence of any tax liability. Spies v. United \nStates, 317 U.S. 492 (1943); United States v. Walker, 479 F.2d 407 (9th  Cir. 1973); United \nStates v. McCabe, 416 F.2d 957 (7th  Cir. 1969); O\u2019Brien v. United States, 51 F.2d 193 (7th  \nCir. 1931). For purposes of this decision, I am not weighing Applicant\u2019s failure to timely \nfile his federal income tax returns against him as crimes. In regard to the failure to timely \nfile federal income tax returns, the DOHA Appeal Board has commented: \nFailure to file tax returns suggests that an applicant has a problem with \ncomplying with well-established governmental rules and systems. Voluntary \ncompliance with such rules and systems is essential for protecting classified \ninformation. ISCR Case No. 01-05340 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 20, 2002). As we \nhave noted in the past, a clearance adjudication is not directed at collecting \ndebts. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 07-08049 at 5 (App. Bd. Jul. 22, 2008). By \nthe same token, neither is it directed toward inducing an applicant to file tax \nreturns. Rather, it is a proceeding aimed at evaluating an applicant\u2019s \njudgment and reliability. Id. A person who fails repeatedly to fulfill his or her \nlegal obligations does not demonstrate the high degree of good judgment \nand reliability required of those granted access to classified information. \nSee, e.g., ISCR Case No. 14-01894 at 5 (App. Bd. Aug. 18, 2015). See \nCafeteria & Restaurant Workers Union Local 473 v. McElroy, 284 F.2d 173, \n183 (D.C. Cir. 1960), aff\u2019d, 367 U.S. 886 (1961). \nISCR Case No. 14-04437 at 3 (App. Bd.

The Appeal Board \nclarified that even in instances where an \u201c[a]pplicant has purportedly corrected [his or her] \nfederal tax problem, and the fact that [applicant] is now motivated to prevent such \nproblems in the future, does not preclude careful consideration of [a]pplicant\u2019s security \nworthiness in light of [his or her] longstanding prior behavior evidencing irresponsibility\u201d \nincluding a failure to timely file federal income tax returns. See ISCR Case No. 15-01031 \nat 3 & n.3 (App. Bd. June 15, 2016) (characterizing \u201cno harm, no foul\u201d approach to an \napplicant\u2019s course of conduct and employing an \u201call\u2019s well that ends well\u201d analysis as \ninadequate to support approval of access to classified information with focus on timing of \nfiling of tax returns after receipt of the SOR).   \nIn ISCR Case No. 15-01031 (App. Bd. June 15, 2016), the Appeal Board explained \nthat in some situations, even if no taxes are owed when tax returns are not timely filed, \ngrant of access to classified information is inappropriate. In ISCR Case No. 15-1031 (App. \nBd. June 15, 2016) the applicant filed his 2011 federal income tax return in December \n2013, his 2012 federal tax return in September 2014, and his 2013 federal tax return in \nOctober 2015. He received federal tax refunds of at least $1,000 for each year. \nNevertheless, the Appeal Board reversed the Administrative Judge\u2019s decision to grant \naccess to classified information. \n7 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n     \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nIn ISCR Case No. 15-06440 at 4 (App. Bd. Dec. 26, 2017) the Appeal Board \nreversed the grant of a security clearance, discussed how AG \u00b6 20(g) applied, and noted: \nThe timing of the resolution of financial problems is an important factor in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s case for mitigation because an applicant who \nbegins to resolve financial problems only after being placed on notice that \nhis clearance was in jeopardy may lack the judgment and self-discipline to \nfollow rules and regulations over time or when there is no immediate threat \nto his own interests. In this case, Applicant\u2019s filing of his Federal income tax \nreturns for 2009-2014 after submitting his SCA, undergoing his background \ninterview, or receiving the SOR undercuts the weight such remedial action \nmight otherwise merit. \nApplicant provided some important evidence of mitigation under AG \u00b6 20(g) \nbecause with the exception of TYs 2016 and 2017, he has filed all of his tax returns, and \nhe has paid all taxes to the federal and state governments. However, under the DOHA \nAppeal Board jurisprudence, this is too little, too late to mitigate security concerns. He did \nnot prove that he was unable to make greater progress sooner filing his federal and state \nincome tax returns. Applicant failed to establish mitigation of financial considerations \nsecurity concerns. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), \u201c[t]he ultimate determination\u201d of whether to grant a security \nclearance \u201cmust be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines\u201d and the whole-person concept.

Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were \naddressed under that guideline but some warrant additional comment. \n. \nApplicant is a 55-year-old project manager, and he has worked for the contractor \nin this role for four or five years.

Sept. 27, 2016), the Appeal Board \nreversed the favorable decision of the administrative judge in a case where the applicant \nfiled his 2009, 2010, and 2011 tax returns in February 2014 and his 2012 tax return in \nAugust 2015 all before the SOR was issued. The applicant in that case owed less than \n$1,800 in federal income taxes for those four TYs at the time of the decision. Id. The \nAppeal Board found the timing of the filing of his tax returns to be an important factor \nstating: \nApplicant did not resolve his tax filing delinquencies until after submission \nof his security clearance application and after undergoing his background \ninterview. Taking action to resolve the delinquent tax filings well after the \ninitiation of the security clearance process undercuts a determination that \nthose actions constitute a good-faith effort to resolve the delinquencies. Id. \nat 5. \nApplicant may not have fully understood or appreciated the importance of the \nrequirement to timely file his federal and state income tax returns in the context of his \neligibility for access to classified information. However, like the applicant in ISCR Case \nNo. 15-03481, he did not establish he was unable to make greater progress sooner in the \nresolution of his tax issues. His actions under the Appeal Board jurisprudence are too \nlittle, too late to fully mitigate security concerns. See ISCR Case No. 15-03481 at 5 (App. \nBd. Sept. 27, 2016). \n9 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_________________________ \nIt is well settled that once a concern arises regarding an applicant\u2019s security \nclearance eligibility, there is a strong presumption against granting a security clearance. \nSee Dorfmont, 913 F. 2d at 1401.

Administrative Judge \nBased upon a review of the case file, pleadings, and exhibits, Applicant did not \nmitigate drug or psychological concerns.

He timely supplemented the record with a letter of \nexplanation that was received without objection as Item 6. The case was assigned to \nme on June 22, 2022. \nSummary of Pleadings \nUnder Guideline H, Applicant allegedly (a) purchased and used marijuana with \nvarying frequency, from about May 2011 to at least July 2017; (b) purchased and used \nLSD with varying frequency from 2015 to about 2016; (c) purchased and used \nPsilocybin Mushrooms and other hallucinogens with varying frequency, from about \nAugust 2014 to about 2017; (d) purchased and used cocaine on at least one occasion in \nJuly 2014, and (e) purchased and used MDA on at least one occasion in July 2014. \nUnder Guideline I, Applicant allegedly was evaluated by a licensed psychologist \nin October 2020 and based on background information, a clinical interview and \nobservations, and an objective personality assessment, was diagnosed with major \ndepression disorder (moderate, recurrent), alcohol use disorder (moderate), cannabis \nuse disorder, in sustained remission, and other hallucinogenic use disorder (moderate, \nin sustained remission). Allegedly, Applicant\u2019s diagnosed condition were considered by \nhis evaluating mental health provider to pose a significant risk to his judgment, \nreliability, or trustworthiness concerning classified information. \nIn his response to the SOR, Applicant admitted all of the allegations with \nexplanations and clarifications.

His answers, as such, \nreflect unqualified admissions. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant is a 29-year-old engineer for a defense contractor who seeks a security \nclearance.

He reported intermittent periods of unemployment between August \n2011 and March 2018. (Item 4) \nApplicant\u2019s drug history \nThroughout his college years (2014-2017), Applicant used and purchased illegal \ndrugs for his personal use. Records document that he purchased and used marijuana \nwith varying frequency, from about May 2011 to at least July 2017; purchased and used \nLSD with varying frequency from 2015 to about 2016; purchased and used Psilocybin \nMushrooms and other hallucinogens (inclusive of LSD) with varying frequency, from \nabout August 2014 to about 2017; purchased and used cocaine on at least one \noccasion in July 2014, and purchased and used MDA on at least one occasion in July \n2014. (Items 2-4) \nIn a personal subject interview (PSI) conducted by an investigator from the Office \nof Personnel Management (OPM) in October 2018, Applicant acknowledged frequent \nsmoking of marijuana in college between 2014 and 2017. (Item 3) Explaining in further \ndetail the frequency of his marijuana use and experimenting with other illegal drugs, he \ntold the OPM investigator he smoked marijuana daily (sometimes with friends but \nmostly alone) to calm himself from being depressed and avert his relying on anti-\ndepressant medications. (Item 3) When asked by the investigator about his future \nintentions for marijuana use, he expressed uncertainty about any recurrent use he might \nconsider in the future.  (Item 3) Based on his OPM interview responses, no clear and \nreliable inferences can be drawn about Applicant\u2019s risks of recurrent involvement with \nillegal drugs.  \nApplicant\u2019s psychological assessments \nApplicant presents with a history of recurrent depression that is traceable to his \nyears in high school. (Items 3-5) While in high school, he met with a therapist and \npsychiatrist for experienced depression symptoms. (Items 3 and 5) Based on the advice \nof his therapist, he voluntarily admitted himself to an inpatient mental health center for \ntreatment to address his recurrent suicidal ideation and increased depression. (Items 3 \nand 5) Following his six-day inpatient hospitalization, he received outpatient treatment \nfor an additional 30 days and was thereafter referred to psychiatrists for follow-up \ntreatment. (Items 3 and 5) \nIn college (2014-2017), Applicant continued with his mental health treatments. \n(Items 3 and 5) Records document that Applicant engaged in recurrent self-harm \nbehaviors between 2011 and 2015. (Items 3 and 5) In October 2020, Applicant was \nreferred by DOHA to a psychological evaluator. (Item 5) After meeting with Applicant \nand reviewing his investigative results and medical records from his 2015 mental health \ntreatment, the retained psychologist concluded that Applicant met the criteria for the \nfollowing disorders: major depressive disorder (moderate, recurrent); alcohol use \ndisorder (moderate), cannabis use disorder (moderate, in sustained remission); and \nother hallucinogen use disorder (moderate, in sustained remission).

In turn, she recommended individual substance abuse treatment and \npsychiatric intervention for Applicant. (Item 5) Additionally, she recommended \nthat Applicant begin individual therapy with a licensed mental health provider to address \n\u201cthe cognitive and behavioral aspects of his conditions (citing insight, impulse control, \ncoping skills, and negative self-talk.).\u201d (Item 5) Wrapping up her evaluation of Applicant, \nthe evaluating psychologist concluded that Applicant\u2019s diagnoses posed a risk to his \njudgment, reliability, and trustworthiness concerning his access to classified information. \n(Item 5) Whether Applicant ever followed up with individual therapy with a licensed \nmental health provider is unknown from the developed record. \nPolicies \nBy virtue of the jurisprudential principles recognized by the U.S. Supreme Court \nin Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988), \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a \nsecurity clearance.\u201d As Commander in Chief, \u201cthe President has the authority to control \naccess to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. \nEligibility for access to classified information may only be granted \u201cupon a finding that it \nis clearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe AGs list guidelines to be considered by judges in the decision-making \nprocess covering DOHA cases. These guidelines take into account factors that could \ncreate a potential conflict of interest for the individual applicant, as well as \nconsiderations that could affect the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified information. These guidelines include conditions that could raise a \nsecurity concern and may be disqualifying (disqualifying conditions), if any, and all of \nthe conditions that could mitigate security concerns, if any. \nThese guidelines must be considered before deciding whether or not a security \nclearance should be granted, continued, or denied. Although, the guidelines do not \nrequire judges to place exclusive reliance on the enumerated disqualifying and \nmitigating conditions in the guidelines in arriving at a decision. \n4 \n\n \n \n                                                                                                                                              \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n          \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                     \n \n           \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nIn addition to the relevant AGs, judges must take into account the pertinent \nconsiderations for assessing extenuation and mitigation set forth in \u00b6 2(a) of the AGs, \nwhich are intended to assist the judges in reaching a fair and impartial, commonsense \ndecision based on a careful consideration of the pertinent guidelines within the context \nof the whole person. The adjudicative process is designed to examine a sufficient period \nof an applicant\u2019s life to enable predictive judgments to be made about whether the \napplicant is an acceptable security risk. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s conduct, the relevant guidelines are to be \nconsidered together with the following \u00b6 2(d) factors: (1) the nature, extent, and \nseriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include \nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which \nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other \npermanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation of the conduct; (8) the potential for \npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or \nrecurrence. \nViewing the issues raised and evidence as a whole, the following individual \nguidelines are pertinent herein: \nDrug Involvement \nThe Concern: Use of an illegal drug or misuse of a prescription \ndrug can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability and \ntrustworthiness, both because it may impair judgment and because it \nraises questions about a person\u2019s ability and willingness to comply \nwith laws, rules, and regulations. AG \u00b6 24. \nPsychological Conditions \nThe Concern: Certain emotional, mental, and personality \nconditions impair judgment, reliability, or trustworthiness. A formal \ndiagnosis of a disorder is not required for there to be a concern under \nthis guideline. A duly qualified mental health professional (e.g., a clinical \npsychologist or psychiatrist) employed by, or acceptable to and approved \nby the U.S. Government, should be consulted when evaluating \npotentially disqualifying and mitigating information under this guideline \nand an opinion, including prognosis, should be sought. No negative \ninference concerning the standards in this guideline may be raised solely \non the basis of mental health counseling. \nBurdens of Proof \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours.

The Government has the burden \nof establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d   See v. \nWashington Metro.

The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the \ncriteria listed therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 \nat 2 (App. Bd.

Additional security concerns are raised over Applicant\u2019s \ndiagnosed major depressive disorder, and other hallucinogen use disorder.  \nDrug involvement and substance misuse concerns \nOn the strength of the evidence presented, three disqualifying conditions of the \nAdjudicative Guidelines (DCs) for drug involvement are apply to Applicant\u2019s situation: \nDC \u00b6\u00b6 25(a), \u201cany substance misuse\u201d; 25(c), \u201cillegal possession of a controlled \nsubstance, including cultivation, processing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or \ndistribution; or possession of drug paraphernalia\u201d; and 25(g), \u201cexpressed intent to \ncontinue drug involvement and substance misuse, or failure to clearly and convincingly \ncommit to discontinue such misuse.\u201d \nApplicant explained that he used marijuana and other drugs for self-medication \npurposes to address his depression symptoms and avert the need for anti-depressive \nmedications. And, he assured that in the future he will not use illegal drugs in the future \n6 \n\n \n \n                                                                                                                                              \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nthat are incompatible with his employment requirements. Besides marijuana, Applicant \nidentified cocaine, LSD, Psilocybin Mushrooms and other hallucinogens (inclusive of \nLSD) that he experimented with. as his drugs of choice. Encouraged by his evaluating \nmental health professional to seek treatment for his substance use disorder, Applicant \nhas not in this record provided any documentary proof of seeking any professional help \nfor his diagnosed cannabis use disorder. Nor did he provide any details of what kind of \nmedical condition or specific medical condition he has or might have that could warrant \nany prescribed medicinal use of marijuana. \nFederal law does not permit marijuana use, or any other illegal drug for any \npurpose (inclusive of medicinal purposes). See 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 802. 812, and 813 \nAdherence to Federal laws prohibiting the purchase and use of illegal drugs is \nmandated for all federal employees and defense contractors having access to classified \ninformation. \nIn addressing the legalization of marijuana in some states, the Department of \nJustice DoJ) and Director of National Intelligence (DNI) issued guidance in 2014 on the \nimpact of state marijuana laws upon the Government and its laws and programs. In a \nmemo issued by the DNI in October 2014 addressing security-related concerns \nassociated with the legalization of marijuana in certain states, the DNI confirmed that \nchanges in state laws and the laws of the District of Columbia pertaining to marijuana \nuse did not affect or impact the AGs covering drug involvement. Federal law has and \ncontinues to control any marijuana use and purchases initiated by Applicant, both \nhistorically and for any use he intends in the future for claimed medicinal purposes. See \nFederal Guidelines (Oct. 25, 2014). \nUnder the terms and conditions of the Controlled Substance Act (CSA ), 21 \nU.S.C. \u00b6 801 et seq.), Congress generally prohibited the cultivation, distribution, and \npossession of marijuana. (Item 10) It established significant penalties for these crimes. \n(21 U.S.C. \u00b6 841 et seq.) These statutes reflect Congress\u2019s determination that \nmarijuana is a dangerous drug and that marijuana activity is a serious crime. DoD \nguidelines implementing the federal legal ban covering marijuana use and possession \nrequire federal prosecutors to weigh all relevant considerations when making \nprosecution decisions. (Item 10)   \nBased on Applicant\u2019s drug use history and past ambiguous statements about his \nlikelihood of ever returning to illegal drug use in the future, mitigation is not available at \nthis time. More time is needed for Applicant to seek advice and counseling on his \nrecurrent use of marijuana and other illegal drugs in the past and obtain favorable \nprognoses on the risks of recurrence before his past purchase and use of marijuana \nand other illegal drugs he experimented with before he can be credited with any \nmeaningful   mitigation. \nPsychological conditions concerns \nBesides incorporating allegations of drug involvement and substance abuse from \nGuideline H, the SOR alleges that Applicant has a long history of mental health issues \n7 \n\n \n \n                                                                                                                                              \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nwith depression and was diagnosed in 2020 by a licensed clinical psychologist with \nmajor depressive disorder (moderate, recurrent).

DC \u00b6 27(b), \u201can opinion by a duly qualified mental health professional that the \nindividual has a condition that may impair judgment, stability, reliability, or \ntrustworthiness\u201d; 27(c), voluntary or involuntary hospitalization\u201d; and 27(d), \u201cfailure to \nfollow a prescribed treatment plan related to a diagnosed psychological/psychiatric \ncondition that may impair judgment, stability, reliability, or trustworthiness, including, but \nnot limited to, failure to take prescribed medication or failure to attend required \ncounseling sessions\u201d applies.  \nMitigation is not available to Applicant at this time. Without evidence of \nApplicant\u2019s following up with recommended mental health counseling, obtaining a \nupdated favorable prognosis from a duly qualified mental health professional, or \notherwise demonstrating that his diagnosed depression disorder was only temporary \nand no longer manifests any indications of emotional instability, favorable inferences of \nmitigation cannot be drawn at this time.  While there is no evidence of specific failures of \nApplicant to follow prescribed treatment recommendations, his lack of any documented \nfollow-up counseling and treatment from a duly authorized mental health provider is \ntroubling and weakens his post-FORM claims of improvement in his personal and \nprofessional life and overall mental health. \nWhole-person assessment \nWhole-person \nassessment \nof \nApplicant\u2019s \nclearance \neligibility \nrequires \nconsideration of whether his history of marijuana involvement and experimentation with \nother drugs over a considerable period of time (six years) for calming and self-\nmedicating purposes is compatible with minimum DoD requirements for holding a \nsecurity clearance. Without any demonstrated compliance with federal law, or with the \nrecommendations of a duly licensed mental health professional, showing that his \nmarijuana involvement and diagnosed psychological conditions are otherwise \ncompatible with DoD requirements for holding a security clearance, Applicant is unable \nto mitigate the Government\u2019s well-documented security concerns. \nWhile Applicant is entitled to credit for his civilian contributions to the defense \nindustry, his efforts are not enough at this time to overcome his lengthy history of \nmarijuana use and purchases, experimentation with other illegal drugs, and diagnosed \ndepression disorder that together create continuing risks of lapses in judgment, \nreliability, and trustworthiness. . \nI have carefully applied the law, as set forth in Department of Navy v. Egan, 484 \nU.S. 518 (1988), Exec. Or. 10865, the Directive, and the AGs, to the facts and \ncircumstances in the context of the whole person.

(SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b) Applicant disclosed on his 2017 SCA that \nhe had not filed his 2015 income tax returns. He indicated, both in his Answer and his \ntestimony, that this was because he was unemployed at the time and was injured with \nno health insurance. (Tr. 30-31, 35; Answer) Applicant clarified in his testimony that it \nwas during tax year 2016 that he was largely unemployed, not 2015. (Tr. 53-54) In \n2016, his income was $461. (Tr. 50-51; GE 2 at 20) \nApplicant also acknowledged that during this period, he withdrew money from his \nIRA retirement account in order to support himself.

Applicant acknowledged that he did not understand the process, and that he \nshould have sought the advice of his tax preparer in considering what to do about his \n2015 income tax returns. (Tr. 38) As to the late filings, Applicant acknowledged that he \nwas at fault and offered no excuse for his tardiness other than being busy and \u201cterrible \nwith documents.\u201d (Tr. 41-43, 78) He said that typically, \u201cI would pile my stuff up and \ncarry it to the tax man.\u201d (Tr. 46) \nApplicant did not provide copies of his 2015 state and federal returns at his \nhearing, but did so afterwards, along with returns from 2014 and 2016.

He affirmed that \nthe [state] returns were filed concurrently with their Federal counterparts. \nThe current date is added whenever the software he uses reprints a \nreturn.\u201d (HE III) \nOn that basis, the timing of the timing of the filing of these state returns is accepted as \nconcurrent with the federal returns for 2014-2016, as noted. \nApplicant documented that his tax returns have always been prepared and filed \nby his longtime tax preparer. Applicant filed his 2014 state and federal tax return in \nJanuary 2016. He received an $884 federal refund and a $508 state refund. (AE I) He \nfiled his 2016 state and federal tax returns in May 2018. (While not alleged, these tax \nreturns were also late, though likely due to Applicant\u2019s medical issues and employment \ninstability at the time). For 2016, he reported income of $461, and received small \nrefunds. (Tr. 50-51; GE 2 at 20; AE K) For tax year 2017, his returns were filed in July \n2018, and he received a refund of $2,711. (GE 2 at 21; Tr. 51) He received small \nrefunds for his state and federal taxes for tax years 2019 (AE F), and 2020 (AE G), and \nhe filed an extension for 2021 (AE H) \nCredit reports from 2017 and 2018 show a few medical debts, but no other debts, \nand more recent credit reports, from September 2019 and April 2022, show no \ndelinquencies. (GE 4 \u2013 GE 7) The SOR alleges no debts. \nApplicant reported on a current personal financial statement that he earns \n$59,000 annually in his job. He reported an extra $10,000 in estimated income from \nside jobs and cattle sales from his farm. After monthly expenses and repayment on his \nmortgage and another loan, he reported a monthly surplus of about $1,637. (AE E) \nPolicies \nIt is well established that no one has a right to a security clearance. As the \nSupreme Court has held \u201cthe clearly consistent standard indicates that security \ndeterminations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Department of Navy v. \nEgan, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988). \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law.

The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(a), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have not drawn inferences grounded on \nmere speculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nThe guideline sets forth several conditions that could raise security concerns \nunder AG \u00b6 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired. \nApplicant failed to timely file his state and federal income tax returns for tax years \n2015 and 2018. AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(c) and 19(f) both apply. \nIn ISCR Case No. 14-04437 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 15, 2016) (emphasis added), the \nDOHA appeal board detailed the security concern about applicants who fail to file their \ntax returns as follows:  \nFailure to file tax returns suggests that an applicant has a problem with \ncomplying with well-established governmental rules and systems. \nVoluntary compliance with such rules and systems is essential for \nprotecting classified information. ISCR Case No. 01-05340 at 3 (App. Bd. \nDec. 20, 2002). As we have noted in the past, a clearance adjudication is \nnot directed at collecting debts. See, e.g., ISCR Case No, 07-08049 at 5 \n(App. Bd. Jul. 22, 2008). By the same token, neither is it directed towards \ninducing an applicant to file tax returns. Rather, it is a proceeding aimed at \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s judgment and reliability. Id. A person who fails \nrepeatedly to fulfill his or her legal obligations does not demonstrate the \nhigh degree of good judgment and reliability required of those granted \naccess to classified information. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 14-01894 at 5 \n(App. Bd. Aug. 18, 2015); See Cafeteria & Restaurant Workers Union \nLocal 473 v. McElroy, 284 F.2d 173, 183 (D.C. Cir. 1960), aff\u2019d, 367 U.S. \n886 (1961). \nConditions that could mitigate financial considerations security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 20. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or \nseparation, clear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity \ntheft), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control; and \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax \nauthority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \nApplicant disclosed on his February 2017 SCA that he had failed to file his 2015 \ntax returns. Those returns were filed in December 2017. He testified that his failure to \nfile was due to employment instability and medical issues following an injury on his \nfarm. While those issues were likely more related to the 2016 tax year, they nonetheless \nwere a contributing factor. AG \u00b6 20(b) therefore is given some consideration. Applicant \nacknowledged, however, that he was largely at fault for his tax issues. \nWhile responding to a tax interrogatory in December 2019, Applicant reported \nthat he had filed his 2018 tax returns the same month, and that he owed $416. Those \nreturns were filed in May 2020, in connection with Applicant\u2019s response to the SOR. He \nprovided documentation from his longtime tax preparer indicating that his 2018 tax \nreturn were not transmitted earlier (as Applicant believed they had been). \nApplicant has had the same tax preparer for many years. He utilized his tax firm \nto address his tax issues properly, although in some cases belatedly. However, \nApplicant\u2019s tax filings are being addressed responsibly through this long relationship. I \ngive that evidence significant weight in concluding that Applicant\u2019s prior tax issues were \ndue to unusual, explainable circumstances, were resolved in reasonably short order, \nand are not likely to recur in the future. Applicant also has no history of significant tax \ndebts or other delinquencies, and his overall finances are stable. AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a), 20(c), \nand 20(g) fully apply. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments \nunder Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. \nI had the opportunity to observe Applicant\u2019s demeanor during his hearing, and \nfound him credible. I believe he understands the importance and security significance of \ncompliance with tax filing requirements, which is why he has retained a tax professional \nfor so many years. His prior tax issues are resolved, and they were due to explainable, \nunusual circumstances. Through his tax preparer, he has a plan and mechanism in \nplace so that he will not have tax filing issues in future years. Applicant provided \nsufficient evidence to mitigate the financial considerations security concerns. Overall, \nthe record evidence leaves me with no questions or doubts as to his eligibility for access \nto classified information. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.b:  \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented, it is clearly consistent with the \ninterests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for access to classified \ninformation.

In November 2003, Applicant was arrested and charged with possession of cannabis. This charge was dismissed, but he was required to complete 50 hours of community service and one year of supervision. In April 2005, he was arrested and charged with driving under the influence (DUI) of drugs, possessing cannabis, improper display license plate, and registration expiration. The charges were dismissed after proving he was not under the influence of cannabis and no cannabis was found in his car. In December 2005, he was arrested and charged with possession of cannabis and drug paraphernalia. This charge was dropped.

His admissions are accepted as findings of fact.  \nApplicant is 35 years old and divorced since 2021. He lives with his girlfriend. He \nhas two children with his former wife and a child with his girlfriend. In 2018, he earned an \nassociate\u2019s degree, and in 2021, a bachelor\u2019s degree in business administration. He is \nenrolled in a master\u2019s degree program. He has been working for a defense contractor for \nthe past six years. He is a supervisor. (Tr. 14-17) \nApplicant has a history of illegally using cannabis. In November 2003, Applicant \nwas arrested and charged with possession of cannabis. This charge was dismissed, but \nhe was required to complete 50 hours of community service and one year of supervision. \nIn April 2005, he was arrested and charged with driving under the influence (DUI) of drugs, \npossessing cannabis, improper display license plate, and registration expiration. The \ncharges were dismissed after proving he was not under the influence of cannabis and no \ncannabis was found in his car. In December 2005, he was arrested and charged with \npossession of cannabis and drug paraphernalia. This charge was dropped. (Tr. 22-24; \nGE 2 at 9, 11; GE 3) \nIn February 2010, Applicant was arrested and charged with felony cultivation of \ncannabis plants, manufacturing/delivering cannabis, and possession of cannabis. He \npleaded guilty to production of cannabis, a felony. He was fined $9,323, placed on \nprobation for two years, and ordered to perform 200 hours of community service. (Tr. 24; \nGE 2 at 10; GE 3) \nIn his April 2017 security clearance application (SCA), Applicant disclosed his 2003 \nand two 2005 misdemeanor charges and his 2010 felony conviction, all of which involved \nthe illegal use and possession of cannabis. (GE 1 at 30-32) He wrote in his SCA that he \n\u201cquit smoking completely when I pursued a position with a [defense contractor] last year.\u201d \n(GE 1 at 34) In his August 2018 background interview about the information in his SCA \n(more than a year after submitting his SCA), Applicant discussed in detail his criminal \nactivity involving cannabis. He told the investigator that he only used cannabis on special \noccasions and would stop using it if necessary to obtain a security clearance. (GE 2 at \n14) In his November 2019 Interrogatories, Applicant stated that he used cannabis on a \nregular basis and intended to use it in the future. He said he used it with his girlfriend. \n(GE 2 at 2-3) \nWhile testifying, Applicant admitted that he purchased and used cannabis with \nvarying frequency from about August 2001 through November 2019. He used it the week \nbefore his hearing. He uses it a couple times a week as a leisure activity to relax. He \nbelieves that holders of security clearances are permitted to use marijuana. He said he is \nnot addicted to it, and could stop if necessary to keep his job.

(Tr. 18-9, 25-26) He stated he \ndid not use marijuana for a couple years prior to 2009. (Tr. 20-22) \nApplicant stated that he was unaware that as an employee for a defense \ncontractor, he was prohibited from using cannabis as it is illegal under federal law. He \nthought that because his state legalized cannabis that the federal government did too. He \nsaid he is not subject to drug testing at his job. (Tr. 27-30) \nPolicies \nThis national security eligibility action was taken under Executive Order 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; \nDOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program \n(January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the National Security Adjudicative \nGuidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information or Eligibility to \nHold a Sensitive Position (AG), which became effective within DOD on June 8, 2017. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility, the administrative judge \nmust consider the AG. In addition to brief introductory explanations for each guideline, \nthe AG list potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used \nin evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in AG \u00b6 2, describing the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known \nas the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere \nspeculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 states an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\u201d \n3 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nFinally, as emphasized in Section 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \n\u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty \nof the applicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple \nprerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline H: Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nAG \u00b6 24 describes the concerns related to the illegal use of controlled \nsubstances, to include the misuse of prescription and non-prescription \ndrugs, and the use of other substances that cause physical or mental \nimpairment or are used in a manner inconsistent with their intended purpose \ncan raise questions about an individual's reliability and trustworthiness, both \nbecause such behavior may lead to physical or psychological impairment \nand because it raises questions about a person's ability or willingness to \ncomply with laws, rules, and regulations. Controlled substance means any \n\"controlled substance\" as defined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is \nthe generic term adopted in this guideline to describe any of the behaviors \nlisted above. \nAG \u00b6 25 sets out two conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying in this case: \n(a) any substance misuse (see above definition); and \n(c) illegal possession of a controlled substance, including cultivation, \nprocessing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of \ndrug paraphernalia. \nApplicant has a long history of illegally possessing and using cannabis. He \nadmitted that from 2001 to 2019, he purchased and used cannabis, except for a couple \nyears prior to 2009. He was arrested three times for illegally using and possessing it. In \n2010, he pleaded guilty to manufacturing cannabis, a felony. The evidence establishes \nthe above two disqualifying conditions. \n4 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \nAG \u00b6 26 lists conditions that could mitigate security concerns raised under this \nguideline: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; and \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and substance \nmisuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and \nhas established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not limited to: \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; \nand \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that any future \ninvolvement or misuse is grounds for revocation of national security \neligibility. \nThere is insufficient evidence to establish the above mitigating conditions. \nApplicant has a 20-year history of illegally using and possessing cannabis, with limited \nintervals of not using it prior to 2009. He asserted that he does not have an addiction to \nit. Although he no longer associates with the drug-using associates with whom he was \ncriminally involved, he continues to regularly use it with his wife. He has not credibly \nasserted that he no longer intends to illegally use cannabis nor has he established a \npattern of abstinence. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n5 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n__________________ \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), \u201c[t]he ultimate determination\u201d of whether to grant a security \nclearance \u201cmust be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines\u201d and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \npertinent facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant has been working as \na supervisor for a defense contractor for the past six years. In his April 2017 SCA, he \ndisclosed his criminal history, which involved illegally using, possessing, and \nmanufacturing cannabis. He stated in his SCA that he quit smoking cannabis when he \napplied for a position with a defense contractor. During his August 2018 interview, he \nasserted that he was using it occasionally, but would stop using it, if necessary for \nobtaining a security clearance. In his 2019 interrogatories, he said he and his wife were \nusing it on a regular basis. During his testimony, he said he used it the week before his \nhearing. He stated that he did not know using cannabis was illegal under federal law. \nAfter reviewing his contradictory statements during this security clearance process, which \nindicated that he stopped or intended to stop using cannabis, I believe that Applicant \nknew or should have known that using cannabis while working for a federal contractor \nwas prohibited. He did not mitigate the security concerns raised under the guideline for \ndrug involvement and substance misuse. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline H: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a through 1.f: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for access to \nclassified information.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant is a 46-year-old employee of a defense contractor, where he has worked since January 2019. He served in the National Guard from 2007 to 2010. He attended college off and on since 2007 without earning a degree, and he is currently enrolled in college. He has never married, but he has lived with his girlfriend for about eight years, and they share two young children. (Tr. at 16-19, 37-38; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 1, 2) The SOR alleges eight delinquent debts. The debts consist of balances due on two auto loans after the vehicles were repossessed (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a - $10,953 and 1.e - $8,591); a defaulted student loan (SOR \u00b6 1.b - $7,142); two medical debts totaling about $165 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d and 1.f); two debts owed to apartment landlords (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c - $613 and 1.g - $1,912); and $841 owed to a telecommunications company (SOR \u00b6 1.h). Unless specifically stated otherwise below, the debts are established by credit reports and Applicant\u2019s admissions. Applicant attributed his financial problems to moving cross country for his job. He also had periods of unemployment and underemployment. (Tr. at 16; GE 1, 2) The creditor for the $10,953 auto loan (SOR \u00b6 1.a) agreed to reduce the amount owed to $5,000, but Applicant did not pay it. The debt \u201caged\u201d off his most recent credit report as beyond the seven-year reporting window.

He served in the National Guard from 2007 to 2010. He \nattended college off and on since 2007 without earning a degree, and he is currently \nenrolled in college. He has never married, but he has lived with his girlfriend for about \neight years, and they share two young children. (Tr. at 16-19, 37-38; Applicant\u2019s \nresponse to SOR; GE 1, 2) \nThe SOR alleges eight delinquent debts. The debts consist of balances due on \ntwo auto loans after the vehicles were repossessed (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a - $10,953 and 1.e - \n$8,591); a defaulted student loan (SOR \u00b6 1.b - $7,142); two medical debts totaling \nabout $165 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d and 1.f); two debts owed to apartment landlords (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c - \n$613 and 1.g - $1,912); and $841 owed to a telecommunications company (SOR \u00b6 1.h). \nUnless specifically stated otherwise below, the debts are established by credit reports \nand Applicant\u2019s admissions.  \nApplicant attributed his financial problems to moving cross country for his job. He \nalso had periods of unemployment and underemployment. (Tr. at 16; GE 1, 2) \nThe creditor for the $10,953 auto loan (SOR \u00b6 1.a) agreed to reduce the amount \nowed to $5,000, but Applicant did not pay it. The debt \u201caged\u201d off his most recent credit \nreport as beyond the seven-year reporting window. He believes the creditor is satisfied \nbecause his current auto loan is with the same financial institution. (Tr. at 20-23; \nApplicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 2-5; AE A) \nApplicant asserted that he settled the $8,591 deficiency balance on the auto loan \nfor a repossessed vehicle (SOR \u00b6 1.e) for \u201c$500 something,\u201d and that he paid the \nsettlement amount in 2019. He stated the amount was paid with a prepaid debit card \nfrom an account he no longer has. The debt is listed by TransUnion and Equifax on the \nSeptember 2018 combined credit report with a last action date of December 2014. The \ndebt is not listed on the Equifax credit reports from 2019, 2020, and 2022. (Tr. at 25-27; \nApplicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 2-5; AE A) \nApplicant owes $31,431 for five federal student loans. He is attending college, so \nall of the loans, including the defaulted loan alleged in the SOR, are currently deferred. \nFour of the loans were taken out within the last two years. He stated that he was on a \n$5 per month loan rehabilitation program in 2019. The 2022 credit report indicates that \nApplicant made four payments in 2020 before the COVID-19 pause and he returned to \nschool. It also shows that he made payments in January and February 2022. (Tr. at 16, \n23-24; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 2-5; AE A) \nApplicant cosigned an apartment lease for a friend. The friend moved out of the \napartment with a balance of $613 due (SOR \u00b6 1.c). The friend did not pay, leaving \nApplicant responsible. Applicant has not paid the account, but he stated that his friend \ntold him that she paid the debt.

He stated that his finances \nhave greatly improved since the start of his background investigation, but took \u201ca little \nhit\u201d because of the COVID-19 pandemic. His girlfriend lost her job because of the \npandemic, and she has been out of work for about a year.

However, that report \nlisted two new past-due debts and two new charged-off debts. A credit card was $48 \npast due with a balance of $822, with the last payment in February 2022. An unsecured \ninstallment account was $360 past due with a balance of $4,850, with the last payment \nin January 2022.

In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant\u2019s financial history, which includes multiple delinquent debts, is sufficient \nto raise the above disqualifying conditions. \nConditions that could mitigate the financial considerations security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 20. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast\ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good\njudgment;  \n \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control; \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \nApplicant attributed his financial problems to moving cross country for his job. He \nalso had periods of unemployment and underemployment. Additionally, his girlfriend lost \nher job because of the pandemic, and she has been out of work for about a year. \nApplicant made assertions about resolving certain debts without providing \ndocumentation. I have accepted those assertions where the debt is no longer listed by \nthe credit reporting agency that originally reported it, and it would otherwise be expected \nto still be on a credit report because seven years had not passed. I am crediting \nApplicant with paying, settling, disputing or otherwise resolving the debts alleged in \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b, 1.d, 1.e, 1.f, and 1.h. Those debts are mitigated. \nApplicant stated that his friend told him that she paid the debt for the cosigned \napartment lease. The debt is not listed on the 2020 and 2022 credit reports, but that is \nnot unexpected because of the seven-year reporting window. There is no direct \nevidence that the debt was paid. The Appeal Board has held that \u201cit is reasonable for a \nJudge to expect applicants to present documentation about the satisfaction of specific \ndebts.\u201d See ISCR Case No. 09-07091 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 11, 2010) (quoting ISCR \nCase No. 04-10671 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2006)). \nApplicant has made some strides in resolving the SOR debts. However, he has \ntaken some steps backward. The April 2022 credit report submitted by Applicant listed \ntwo new past-due debts and two new charged-off debts. \nThere is insufficient evidence for a determination that Applicant\u2019s financial \nproblems will be resolved within a reasonable period. I am unable to find that he acted \nresponsibly under the circumstances or that he made a good-faith effort to pay his \ndebts. His financial issues are recent and ongoing. They continue to cast doubt on his \ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. I find that the security concerns \narising out of Applicant\u2019s delinquent debts are not mitigated. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude Applicant did not \nmitigate the financial considerations security concerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.a: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.b: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.c: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.d-1.f: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.g: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.h: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIt is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for \na security clearance.

He has worked for \nhis current employer since about November 2018. He was first granted a security \nclearance in about 2002, but it lapsed when he was employed by a company that did \nnot require that he hold a clearance. He has a bachelor\u2019s degree. He is divorced with \nthree children. (Transcript (Tr.) at 24, 27, 45-46; GE 1; AE C) \nApplicant has a history of alcohol-related driving offenses. He was arrested in \n2000 in State A and charged with driving under the influence (DUI). He pleaded no \ncontest and was found guilty. He was sentenced to 10 days in jail, with 9 days \nsuspended, and a fine. His driver\u2019s license was restricted, and he was required to attend \nalcohol education classes. (Tr. at 25-26; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 4) \nApplicant was arrested in 2011 in State A and charged with DUI. He pleaded no \ncontest and was found guilty. He was sentenced to 10 days in jail, with 7 days \nsuspended, and a fine. (Tr. at 27-29; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 4, 9) \nApplicant was arrested in August 2018 in State B after he fell asleep and hit a car \nthat was stopped at a light. The driver of the second vehicle was taken to the hospital \nwith minor injuries. Applicant stated that he was drinking and had taken his sleep \nmedication, and then a friend called and asked to meet at a bar. The investigation \nrevealed that shortly before the accident, Applicant was asked to leave a bar because \nhe was too intoxicated. He was charged with DUI of an alcoholic beverage, causing \nbodily injury to another; DUI with a blood alcohol concentration (BAC) of .08% or more, \ncausing bodily injury to another; and DUI of a drug, causing bodily injury to another. (Tr. \nat 34-35; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 1, 5, 6) \nIn his September 2018 Questionnaire for National Security Positions (SF 86), \nApplicant wrote: \nI will go to court in December 2018. I will plead no contest and accept my \npunishment. I am responsible for this embarrassing event. The day after \nmy arrest, I contacted Alcoholics Anonymous, obtained a sponsor and \nhave been meeting with him every day since then. I also regularly attend \nAA meetings and I am working on the 12 steps of recovery. I am \nconvinced that my drinking is a problem. I am determined to never drink \nagain. I know that the results of my drinking could have meant injury or \ndeath to an innocent motorist and I am putting into action the steps to \navoid this ever happening again. (GE 1) \nIn July 2019, Applicant pleaded nolo contendere to all charges. He was \nsentenced to 90 days in jail (suspended); probation for three years; 20 days of \ncommunity labor; completion of a three-month alcohol and drug education counseling \nprogram; and $936 in fines, court costs, and restitution. Terms of his probation included \nnot driving with any measurable amount of alcohol or intoxicating drug in his system; \nattendance at 12 Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) meetings; completion of a victim impact \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \npanel (VIP); and installation of an ignition interlock device on his car.

He paid a fine of \n$174. Applicant stated that the status of his driver\u2019s license was unclear, but he knew \nthat he should not be driving. He testified that he \u201creally only [drove] to work and back, \ngrocery store and back.\u201d Applicant now has a valid driver\u2019s license in State A, but that \nwas issued in January 2021.1  (Tr. at 47-48; GE 8) \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                          \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant admitted that he is an alcoholic.

He stated that he had a \nbreakthrough while attending an AA meeting in late October 2019. He finally \nsurrendered to alcohol, and admitted that he lost the fight. He has been sober since \nNovember 3, 2019. He currently attends three AA meetings per week; he is a sponsor; \nand he volunteers at a facility for troubled teens.

(Tr. at 20-23, 30-32, \n37-44, 49-50; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; AE B, D) \nApplicant\u2019s addiction psychiatrist wrote that Applicant is meeting with him every \ntwo to three weeks. He wrote that Applicant has consistently demonstrated that he has \na solid foundation in recovery. He concluded: \nAs is quite frequently the case, and certainly with [Applicant], individuals \nthat find Recovery, emerge an even better version of themselves. \nIndividuals that have known suffering, known struggle, known loss, but \nhave found a way out of the depths, have a unique understanding of life, \nthat fills them with compassion, perspective, and humility. In my \nprofessional opinion, having cared for this patient population for nearly 15 \nyears, [Applicant] exhibits all of the characteristics and clinical signs, of \nsomeone \u201cliving a Life of Recovery.\u201d (AE B) \nApplicant self-reported his alcohol-related offenses. He requested that I consider \nthe possibility of a \u201cprobationary clearance,\u201d which is a conditional clearance and is \npermitted under the adjudicative guidelines. (Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 1, 9; AE \nE) \n1 These charges were not alleged in the SOR and cannot be used for disqualification purposes.

(AE A, C) \nPolicies \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG), which became \neffective on June 8, 2017. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline G, Alcohol Consumption \nThe security concern for alcohol consumption is set out in AG \u00b6 21: \nExcessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable \njudgment or the failure to control impulses, and can raise questions about \nan individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 22. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while under \nthe influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or \nother incidents of concern, regardless of the frequency of the individual's \nalcohol use or whether the individual has been diagnosed with alcohol use \ndisorder; and \n(c) habitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point of impaired \njudgment, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed with alcohol \nuse disorder. \nApplicant was arrested for DUI in 2000, 2011, and 2018. The above disqualifying \nconditions are applicable. \nConditions that could mitigate alcohol consumption security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 23. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) so much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, \nor judgment; \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her pattern of maladaptive alcohol \nuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and \nhas demonstrated a clear and established pattern of modified \nconsumption \nor \nabstinence \nin \naccordance \nwith \ntreatment \nrecommendations; and \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n(d) the individual has successfully completed a treatment program along \nwith any required aftercare, and has demonstrated a clear and established \npattern of modified consumption or abstinence in accordance with \ntreatment recommendations. \nApplicant is an admitted alcoholic who has been sober since November 3, 2019. \nHe has been in treatment several times; he is now a regular participant in AA meetings; \nhe is on Antabuse; and he regularly sees an addiction psychiatrist who made a strong \nstatement that Applicant is \u201cliving a Life of Recovery.\u201d Additionally, Applicant was open \nand honest at his hearing, and I believe he is sincere. However, Applicant was likely \nalso sincere when he made similar statements about his sobriety in his September 2018 \nSF 86 and then returned to drinking. Relapses are to be expected, but this time does \nfeel different. He has been sober longer than ever before, and I believe he did have a \nbreakthrough. \nNonetheless, I have lingering concerns that are primarily related to Applicant\u2019s \nwillingness to violate the law and place others in danger. His most recent DUI resulted \nin an accident with the other driver going to the hospital. Applicant is still on probation \nfor that offense, but he was willing to drive in 2019 even though he knew there were \nproblems with his driver\u2019s license and he should not be driving. I wish Applicant well, but \nAG \u00b6 2(b) requires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national \nsecurity eligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d If he continues on his \ncurrent path, Applicant will once again rate a security clearance. At this time, none of \nthe mitigating conditions are sufficient to overcome concerns about his alcohol use, \nreliability, trustworthiness, and judgment. \nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct \nThe security concern for criminal conduct is set out in AG \u00b6 30: \nCriminal activity creates doubt about an Applicant\u2019s judgment, reliability, \nand trustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person\u2019s \nability or willingness to comply with laws, rules and regulations. \nAG \u00b6 31 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. The following are potentially applicable: \n(b) evidence (including, but not limited to, a credible allegation, an \nadmission, and matters of official record) of criminal conduct, regardless of \nwhether the individual was formally charged, prosecuted, or convicted; \nand \n(c) individual is currently on parole or probation. \nApplicant\u2019s three DUIs were cross-alleged under criminal conduct. He remains on \nprobation until July 2022. The above disqualifying conditions are applicable. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nConditions that could mitigate criminal conduct security concerns are provided \nunder AG \u00b6 32. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur \nand does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or \ngood judgment; and \n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including, but not limited \nto, the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, restitution, \ncompliance with the terms of parole or probation, job training or higher \neducation, \ngood \nemployment \nrecord, \nor \nconstructive \ncommunity \ninvolvement. \nApplicant has been sober since November 2019. He has a strong work record \nand favorable character evidence. However, he also has three DUIs, the last of which \ninvolved an accident; he remains on probation; and he drove under questionable \ncircumstances in 2019 while he was on probation. I have unmitigated concerns under \nthe same rationale discussed in the alcohol consumption analysis. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) The nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guidelines G and J in my whole-person analysis. I also considered \nApplicant\u2019s favorable character evidence. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude Applicant did not \nmitigate the alcohol consumption and criminal conduct security concerns.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact The amended SOR alleges that, as of February 28, 2020, Applicant owed $14,391 on a charged-off automobile loan (SOR \u00b6 1.a); $449 on a charged-off account (SOR \u00b6 1.b); $6,104 in collection placed by a utility company (SOR \u00b6 1.c); $1,540 in collection placed by a storage company (SOR \u00b6 1.d); $916 in collection by a utility company (SOR \u00b6 1.e); and $706 in collection placed by a fitness club (SOR \u00b6 1.f). Applicant is also alleged to have failed to file her federal income tax returns for tax years 2020 and 2021 by her June 15, 2022 hearing (SOR \u00b6 1.g). Applicant admitted the delinquencies, which she explained were incurred largely because of her spouse\u2019s loss of income due to multiple injuries, but indicated that she has paid the fitness club debt. As previously noted, she admitted at her hearing that she has not filed her federal income tax returns for tax years 2020 and 2021 because she cannot afford to pay a tax-return preparer. I accept and incorporate as factual findings that the SOR debts became delinquent as alleged and that Applicant has not file her income tax returns for the last two years. After considering the pleadings, exhibits, and transcript, I make the following additional findings of fact. Applicant is a 59-year-old media production associate with an associate\u2019s degree earned in June 1984 from a community college. (GE 1; Tr. 29.) She has worked for her current employer, a defense contractor, since July 1985, and is currently on a technical manua",

The SOR \nexplained why the DCSA CAF was unable to find it clearly consistent with the national \ninterest to grant or continue security clearance eligibility for her. The DCSA CAF took the \naction under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \nIndustry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense (DOD) Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the National Security Adjudicative Guidelines for \n1 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nDetermining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information or Eligibility to Hold a Sensitive \nPosition (AG) effective within the DOD on June 8, 2017. \nOn April 15, 2020, Applicant submitted a response that was not complete. \nProcessing of her case was apparently delayed due to the COVID-19 pandemic. On \nSeptember 28, 2021, the DCSA CAF advised Applicant to admit or deny each of the \nsubparagraphs in the SOR. Applicant then submitted an undated response, which was \nreceived by the DCSA CAF around November 24, 2021, in which she answered the \nallegations and requested a hearing before an administrative judge from the Defense \nOffice of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA). On March 30, 2022, Department Counsel \nindicated that the Government was ready to proceed to a hearing. On April 11, 2022, the \ncase was assigned to me to determine whether it is clearly consistent with the interests of \nnational security to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant. I received the case \nfile and assignment on April 18, 2021. After some coordination with the parties, on May 17, \n2022, I scheduled a video conference hearing for June 15, 2022. \nAt the hearing convened on June 15, 2022, three Government exhibits (GEs 1-3) \nwere admitted into the record. Applicant objected to proposed GE 4, a summary report of \nher personal subject interview. The document was not accepted into the record as it lacked \nthe authentication required for admissibility under E3.1.20 of the Directive. Applicant \ntestified, as reflected in a hearing transcript (Tr.) received by DOHA on July 13, 2022. \nOn the Government\u2019s motion and over Applicant\u2019s objections, I amended the SOR at \nthe hearing pursuant to \u00b6 E3.1.17 of the Directive, as set forth below. I held the record for \ntwo weeks after the hearing for Applicant to submit documentary evidence and to respond \nto the new allegation. The June 29, 2022 deadline passed without any documents or \nresponse from Applicant. \nSOR Amendment \nAt her hearing, Applicant testified to having withdrawn funds from her retirement \naccount to pay some of her debts. Inquiry into whether she paid the taxes on that \nwithdrawal led to an admission from Applicant that she had not filed her federal income tax \nreturns for tax years 2020 and 2021 because of a lack of funds to pay a tax-return \npreparer. Pursuant to \u00b6 E3.1.17, the Government moved to amend the SOR to add a new \nallegation under Guideline F, as follows: \n1.g. You failed to file, as required, federal tax returns for tax years 2020 and \n2021. As of the date of this hearing, those returns remain unfiled. \nApplicant objected on the basis that the information about her tax returns was \noutside the scope of her May 2017 SF 86, as she understood the hearing covered her \nfinancial situation that existed during the seven years preceding that clearance application. \nThere is no provision in the Directive that limits inquiry to the time period of the current \nbackground investigation. The Appeal Board has held that the SOR should be easily \namended so that a case is adjudicated on the merits of relevant issues. See, e.g., ISCR \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nCase No. 19-01014 at 4 (Oct. 5, 2020) (citing 17-02952 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Aug. 3, 2018)). I \ngranted the amendment in accord with E3.1.17, which provides that the SOR may be \namended at the hearing \u201cso as to render it in conformity with the evidence admitted.\u201d \nHowever, because of due process concerns raised by the lack of advance notification to \nApplicant that her tax filings would be considered as an issue for her clearance eligibility, I \nadvised the parties that I would consider the tax-filing issue solely for its relevance and \nmateriality to her financial situation. In accord with \u00b6 E.3.1.17, I gave Applicant two weeks \nto submit comments and documentation in response to the amendment. No response was \nreceived. \nFindings of Fact \nThe amended SOR alleges that, as of February 28, 2020, Applicant owed $14,391 \non a charged-off automobile loan (SOR \u00b6 1.a); $449 on a charged-off account (SOR \u00b6 1.b); \n$6,104 in collection placed by a utility company (SOR \u00b6 1.c); $1,540 in collection placed by \na storage company (SOR \u00b6 1.d); $916 in collection by a utility company (SOR \u00b6 1.e); and \n$706 in collection placed by a fitness club (SOR \u00b6 1.f). Applicant is also alleged to have \nfailed to file her federal income tax returns for tax years 2020 and 2021 by her June 15, \n2022 hearing (SOR \u00b6 1.g). Applicant admitted the delinquencies, which she explained were \nincurred largely because of her spouse\u2019s loss of income due to multiple injuries, but \nindicated that she has paid the fitness club debt. As previously noted, she admitted at her \nhearing that she has not filed her federal income tax returns for tax years 2020 and 2021 \nbecause she cannot afford to pay a tax-return preparer. \nI accept and incorporate as factual findings that the SOR debts became delinquent \nas alleged and that Applicant has not file her income tax returns for the last two years. \nAfter considering the pleadings, exhibits, and transcript, I make the following additional \nfindings of fact. \nApplicant is a 59-year-old media production associate with an associate\u2019s degree \nearned in June 1984 from a community college. (GE 1; Tr. 29.) She has worked for her \ncurrent employer, a defense contractor, since July 1985, and is currently on a technical \nmanual team. (GE 1; Tr. 40.) She has held a clearance for most of her employment, and \nwas first granted a DOD secret clearance in approximately 1999. (Tr. 31.) \nApplicant and her spouse married in in February 2003, after they had been together \nfor 20 years. (Tr. 30.) Applicant indicated on her May 23, 2017 Questionnaire for National \nSecurity Positions (SF 86) that she and her spouse separated in April 2016. They were \nliving apart at the time, but were not legally separated. They have a 35-year-old son and a \n33-year-old daughter. (GE 1; Tr. 30.) \nIn March 1996, Applicant purchased a home that had three separate apartment \nunits. (GE 1.) They converted two of the units into one larger area. (Tr. 39.) No information \nis in evidence showing the initial mortgage balance. While working for an office installation \ncompany, Applicant\u2019s spouse was injured shortly thereafter when a freight elevator \nmalfunctioned, and he was struck in the head. (Tr. 21.) He lost about 30% of his hearing \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nand was unable to work for several months. (Tr. 22.) He had no medical insurance to cover \nhis medical bills. (Tr. 24.) \nWhen Applicant\u2019s spouse was able to return to work, he tried some side jobs with \ncontractors that did not work out due to his hearing loss. (Tr. 22.) Applicant recalls that it \nwas during that time of her spouse\u2019s lack of stable employment that she obtained the \nassistance of a debt-repair company to negotiate with her creditors. She obtained a second \nmortgage on their home (loan amount not in evidence), and with the funds paid off the \ndebts they had at the time with the assistance of the credit-repair company. (Tr. 50-51.) \nShe had some credit counseling at that time but has had no financial counseling since \nthen. (Tr. 50.) \nWhile helping a friend with a roof repair around June 2005, Applicant\u2019s spouse \ninjured himself in a fall. He was hospitalized for two months, although he had medical \ninsurance through Applicant which covered some of his medical debts. (Tr. 24.) When \nApplicant\u2019s spouse was able to return to work, his father got him a job as a longshoreman. \nApplicant\u2019s spouse was not in that job long when a tractor-trailer truck backed him into \nanother trailer. He incurred multiple surgeries and was out of work for 18 months without \nincome before he received worker\u2019s compensation. Medical insurance paid some of his \nmedical expenses, but some medical debts went into collections. Applicant took hardship \nwithdrawals from her retirement account at work to pay some of their debts. Even so, her \nmortgage lender initiated foreclosure proceedings in 2009. Her account was last active in \nJune 2007. (GE 3; Tr. 23-24.) After vacating her foreclosed home in October 2010, \nApplicant rented her living quarters for the next ten years. (GE 1.) \nIn late 2013, Applicant had a car accident. Her vehicle, which she had bought in \nAugust 2013, was determined by her insurer to be not repairable. Even though she had \ngap insurance, her lender is holding her liable for a $449 debt on her loan (SOR \u00b6 1.b). \nDuring the 2014 to 2015 timeframe, Applicant\u2019s financial situation was particularly dire. She \ndefaulted on the car loan for her next vehicle (SOR \u00b6 1.a) around the time that her spouse \nsustained a back injury. He became addicted to his pain medications and was out of work \nfor at least a month while undergoing rehabilitation treatment. While he was in the \nrehabilitation facility, Applicant could no longer afford the rent-to-own house in which she \nhad been living. She rented a storage unit for her belongings, and she moved into a motel \ntemporarily until she could save up enough money for a new apartment. She stopped \npaying her rent for the storage unit (SOR \u00b6 1.d). (Tr. 33-34.) \nWhen Applicant completed her SF 86 in May 2017, she responded negatively to the \nSF 86 financial record inquiries, including whether she had any possessions or property \nrepossessed or foreclosed in the last seven years; whether she had defaulted on any loans \nin the last seven years; and whether any bills or debts had been placed for collection in the \nlast seven years. (GE 1.) As of July 25, 2017, the credit reporting agencies were reporting \nseveral delinquencies on her credit report.

The loan had a high interest rate. Applicant struggled to make the \nloan payments. Her April 2019 credit report shows a date of last activity in November 2014. \n(GE 2.) She surrendered the vehicle in a voluntary repossession when her spouse was in \nthe rehabilitation program. (Tr. 33.) In June 2015, her account was charged off for $14,391. \n(GE 3.) She believed she owed nothing on the debt following the repossession until she \nbegan receiving demands for payment of the deficiency balance. (Tr. 34.) She contacted \nthe creditor and was told the debt was in collections. She does not know who currently \nholds the debt. (Tr. 33.) She has made no payments on that debt as of her June 2022 \nhearing. (Tr. 25, 33.) \nCharged-off account for $449 (SOR \u00b6 1.b) \nIn August 2013, Applicant obtained a car loan for $18,131, to be repaid at $139 per \nmonth for 73 months. After making only a few payments on her car loan, she was in an \naccident, and the insurance company totaled her vehicle. She received a settlement from \nher primary auto insurer, but it did not fully cover the balance of her loan. She had gap \ninsurance, but due to a delay involving an issue with the title between the lender and her \ngap insurer, she ended up owing $1,196. Her lender charged off that debt in November \n2014. Her July 2017 credit report shows a $457 balance on the account with a date of last \nactivity in June 2016. (GE 3.) She does not believe that she should pay the debt as she did \nnot have the car and did not legally hold the title. Her lender was supposed to provide the \ntitle to the gap insurer by a certain date and did not do so. (Answer; Tr. 25, 35-38.) \nApplicant disputed her liability for the debt with the creditor bank, but she does not know if \nshe has any paperwork about the debt. She has not contacted her creditor about resolving \nthe debt, which she believes is now around $1,000. (Tr. 36-37.) \nCollection account for $6,104 (SOR \u00b6 1.c) \nIn November 2014, a utility company placed a $6,104 balance in collection for \nunpaid gas charges incurred in the home that was lost to foreclosure. As of June 2017, no \nprogress was reported on reducing the debt. (GE 3.) Applicant has not made any payments \non that debt as of June 2022. (Tr. 25, 39.) When she contacted the creditor, she was told \nthe debt had been written off.

(GE 3.) \nApplicant believes the debt is from the second gas account at the premises lost to \nforeclosure in 2010 (Tr. 40), although it is unclear when that debt was incurred. The debt \nappears only on the July 2017 credit report. There is no activity date or assignment date \nlisted for the debt, and the collection agent is not the same as that holding the larger gas \ndebt in SOR \u00b6 1.c. Applicant has made no payments on the debt as of June 2022. (Tr. 25.) \nCollection account for $706 (SOR \u00b6 1.f) \nFees assessed for a gym membership went unpaid and were placed for collection in \nthe amount of $706. As of June 2017, the debt had not been paid. (GE 3.) Available \ninformation does not reflect when Applicant incurred the debt. She paid the debt in 2020, \nafter she received the SOR. (Tr. 25, 61.) I held the record open after her hearing for her to \nsubmit an email from the gym confirming her payment. No document was submitted. \nApplicant\u2019s July 2017 (GE 3) and April 2019 (GE 2) credit reports include an account \n(not alleged) for an automobile that was involuntarily repossessed. The account was \nopened in January 2016 for $11,495, with terms of repayment at $433 per month for three \nyears. As of June 2017, she was reportedly $5,072 past due on a debt balance of $12,782. \nAs of April 2018, the account had a zero balance, so the creditor may well have taken the \nvehicle in full satisfaction of the debt. However, Applicant was not asked about the debt, \nand it was not alleged. As of April 2019, only the debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b were still on \nher credit report. (GE 2.) \nWhile working for a roofing company, Applicant\u2019s spouse purchased a 2010 model-\nyear truck with a loan of about $30,000, to be repaid at almost $640 per month for five \nyears. (Tr. 52-53.) Applicant testified that her spouse has about six months left on the loan \n(Tr. 53), so it appears that he obtained the loan around early 2018. The loan has a high \ninterest rate because her spouse did not have established credit. She testified that he was \ntold that after the first three payments, he could refinance to lower their monthly payment. \nThey were not successful in refinancing the loan, and it has been a struggle to maintain \ntheir payments. (Tr. 45-46.) The truck is used primarily by Applicant. (Tr. 46.) \nIn March or April 2020, Applicant received the SOR, informing her of the debts of \nconcern to the DOD. She paid the gym debt, but otherwise made no efforts to resolve her \npast-due accounts. (Tr. 25, 33-40.) \nApplicant and her spouse fell behind on other debts during the COVID-19 pandemic \ndue to his lack of steady income. He worked for a temporary agency that assigned projects \nin the trades until April 2020 when construction jobs were shutdown. He was out of work for \na couple of months until June 2020, when he started working in roof repair for a real estate \ncompany. In November 2020, with both Applicant and her spouse employed, they were \nable to purchase their home, although she had to take withdrawals from her retirement \naccount at work to pay down their debt so they could qualify for their mortgage.

She had been paying rent at $1,550 per month for the \nprevious four years. (Tr. 58.) \nIn June 2021, Applicant\u2019s spouse lost his job when his employer went into \u201csemi\u00ad\nretirement\u201d and no longer needed his services. He was unemployed for the next ten \nmonths. (Tr. 26.) In February 2022, Applicant took a withdrawal of almost $4,000 from her \nretirement account at work to pay bills. Some $3,000 of those funds went toward their \nelectric bill. (Tr. 53-54.) She concentrated on paying her household bills and some credit-\ncard debts incurred during the pandemic. (Tr. 37.) \nIn April 2022, Applicant\u2019s spouse began working 32 hours per week at $14.70 per \nhour for a municipality at its transfer station. (Tr. 26-29, 43.) Applicant\u2019s annual salary with \nher defense-contractor employer, after some 35 years with the company, is now close to \n$60,000 following a recent raise and a job promotion in May 2022.

Her take-home pay for the two-week pay \nperiod was $1,275 on April 7, 2022; $1,782 on May 19, 2022; and $1,424 on June 2, 2022. \n(Tr. 42.) \nApplicant and her spouse are not presently able to pay all of their bills in full each \nmonth by their due dates, although they make their mortgage payment of $1,750 on time. \n(Tr. 29, 44.) She and her spouse owe about $5,000 in total credit-card balances. (Tr. 54.) \nOne of his credit cards is in collections status. Applicant is currently paying $46 a month on \na credit-card account that is not in collections. (Tr. 56.) They live from paycheck to \npaycheck, and Applicant has to choose between which credit-card account to pay one \nmonth and which the next. (Tr. 57.) \nApplicant and her spouse use propane for hot water and cooking, which costs them \nabout $200 to $300 for the year. They have electric heat, which in the winter costs them \nalmost $1,000 a month. They currently owe their electricity provider almost $5,000, and \nshe has been paying $550 a month under a payment plan to the utility company. Applicant \nis looking into some state assistance for their electric bill on the basis of hardship. She has \nbeen told that she qualifies for temporary assistance. Their cell phones cost them almost \n$100 a month for two lines. They pay a similar amount for their Internet service. (Tr. 44-47.) \nApplicant and her spouse have not yet filed their federal income tax returns for tax \nyears 2020 and 2021. They reside in a state that does not tax resident income, but \nApplicant works in a state that taxes income earned in the state by out-of-state residents. \nThat state did not deduct income taxes from the paychecks of workers living in Applicant\u2019s \nstate during the pandemic. Applicant does not expect to owe taxes for 2020 and 2021, but \nshe does not have the money to pay a tax preparer to file her returns. (Tr. 49-50.) \nApplicant wants to pay her debts.

She denies that she would compromise her job to pay her debts. \n(Tr. 72-73.) \nPolicies \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion the Executive \nBranch has in regulating access to information pertaining to national security, emphasizing \nthat \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 \nU.S. 518, 528 (1988). When evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, \nthe administrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are required to be considered in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. These guidelines \nare not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, \nthese guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative \nprocess. The administrative judge\u2019s overall adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious \nscrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative \njudge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, \nfavorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence \nto establish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant \nis responsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation about potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Section 7 of EO 10865 \nprovides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a \ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section \n3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information). \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \nAnalysis \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nThe security concerns about financial considerations are articulated in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness \nto abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about an \nindividual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified or \nsensitive information. Financial distress can also be caused or exacerbated \nby, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other issues of personnel security \nconcern such as excessive gambling, mental health conditions, substance \nmisuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An individual who is financially \noverextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or otherwise \nquestionable acts to generate funds. . .  \nThe Appeal Board explained the scope and rationale for the financial considerations \nsecurity concern in ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012) (citation omitted) \nas follows: \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an applicant might knowingly \ncompromise classified information in order to raise money in satisfaction of \nhis or her debts. Rather, it requires a Judge to examine the totality of an \napplicant\u2019s financial history and circumstances. The Judge must consider \npertinent evidence regarding the applicant\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other \nqualities essential to protecting the national secrets as well as the \nvulnerabilities inherent in the circumstances. The Directive presumes a \nnexus between proven conduct under any of the Guidelines and an \napplicant\u2019s security eligibility. \nGuideline F security concerns are established when an individual does not pay \nfinancial obligations according to terms. Applicant is not disputing the delinquencies in the \nSOR, although she does not believe that she should be required to pay the balance left on \nthe car loan (SOR \u00b6 1.b) for the vehicle totaled in an accident because she carried gap \ninsurance. She admitted at her hearing that she has not filed her federal income tax returns \nfor tax years 2020 and 2021 because she does not have the funds to pay a tax preparer. \nThe following disqualifying conditions under AG \u00b6 19 apply: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and  \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income tax \nreturns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired. \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nIn addition to the SOR debts, Applicant is reported to have defaulted on an $11,495 \ndebt for an automobile that ended up being involuntarily repossessed. Since the loan was \nnot alleged in the SOR, it cannot be considered for disqualification purposes. The Appeal \nBoard has held that unalleged debts can properly be considered for other purposes, such \nas assessing an applicant\u2019s credibility; evaluating an applicant\u2019s evidence of extenuation, \nmitigation, or changed circumstances; considering whether an applicant has demonstrated \nsuccessful rehabilitation; or providing evidence for the whole-person analysis. See ISCR \nCase No. 03-20327 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, 2006). Applicant was not asked about the debt, \nand the account reportedly had a zero balance as of April 2018. Not enough is known \nabout that debt to consider it in this case. \nApplicant bears the burden of mitigating the negative implications for her financial \njudgment raised by her proven delinquent debts and failure to file her income tax returns by \ntheir due dates. Application of the aforesaid disqualifying conditions triggers consideration \nof the potentially mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20. The following are relevant to the \nissues in this case: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under \nsuch circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the \nindividual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue; and \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority \nto file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \n10 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(a) cannot reasonably apply, even though the SOR debts are old. Applicant \nhas made no payments on the delinquencies in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.e. An applicant\u2019s \nongoing, unpaid debts evidence a continuing course of conduct and are considered recent. \nSee, e.g., ISCR 17-03146 at 2 (App. Bd. Jul. 31, 2018), citing, e.g., ISCR Case No. 15-\n08779 at 3 (App. Bd. Nov. 3, 2017). \nApplicant testified about her spouse being injured multiple times, although in that \nregard, her evidence lacks specificity as to the amount of lost income; the extent of medical \nout-of-pocket costs; and even the dates of occurrence. She provided no documentation to \nsubstantiate her testimony. Even so, it appears the loss of spousal income, for periods \nvarying from 18 months to as long as a few years, and other unforeseen circumstances \ncaused significant financial stress for Applicant over the years. In approximately 1996, her \nspouse was without medical insurance when he was injured in a freight elevator accident. \nHe was largely unemployed for a few years following his accident. Then, around June \n2005, he fell off a roof and was hospitalized for two months. While he had health insurance \nby then, he was again unable to work. In his next job as a longshoreman, he was pinned by \na tractor-trailer truck and was without any income for 18 months. \nApplicant took withdrawals from her retirement account at work to pay bills, including \nsome medical expenses, before her spouse retroactively received worker\u2019s compensation \npay. She became seriously delinquent on her heating bill (SOR \u00b6 1.c) and mortgage loan. \nIn 2010, she lost her first house to foreclosure because she could not make the mortgage \npayments and other household expenses on her income. When she vacated that home, \nshe owed a substantial utility delinquency (SOR \u00b6 1.c). \nIn late 2013, Applicant had an unforeseen vehicle accident in which her new car was \ntotaled. The debt in SOR \u00b6 1.b resulted from that accident. Her next car was bought in \nJanuary 2014 with the loan in SOR \u00b6 1.a. It appears that she stopped paying on the loan in \nNovember 2014. The loan was charged off in June 2015. Her spouse, while repairing roofs \nout of state, sustained a back injury in 2015. He became addicted to his pain medications \nand was out of work for at least a month while undergoing rehabilitation treatment. \nApplicant could no longer afford the rent-to-own house in which she had been living. She \nrented a storage unit for her belongings, and she moved into a motel until she could save \nup enough money for a new apartment, but then she defaulted on the payments for the \nstorage unit (SOR \u00b6 1.d). \nThere is little to no detail about Applicant\u2019s spouse\u2019s income or his work from about \n2016 until 2020. At some point during that time, he started working for a temporary agency \nthat assigned work in the trades, but he lost that job in April 2020 when construction work \nceased due to the pandemic. He was unemployed until approximately June 2020. He was \nemployed as a roofer for approximately the next ten months, but he lost that job in June \n2021 when his employer went into \u201csemi-retirement\u201d and no longer needed his services. He \nwas unemployed for the next ten months when he began working part time at $14.70 an \nhour. AG \u00b6 20(b) is established in a significant aspect in that circumstances outside of \nApplicant\u2019s control caused or contributed to her financial difficulties at various times over \nthe past 25 years. \n11 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nEven if Applicant\u2019s financial difficulties arose in whole or in part due to \ncircumstances outside of her control, I have to consider whether she has acted in a \nresponsible manner when dealing with her financial difficulties. See ISCR Case No. 05-\n11366 at 4 n. 9 (App. Bd. Jan. 12, 2007) (citing ISCR Case No. 99-0462 at 4 (App. Bd. \nMay 25, 2000); ISCR Case No. 99-0012 at 4 (App. Bd. Dec. 1, 1999); ISCR Case No. 03-\n13096 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 29, 2005)). A component of financial responsibility is whether \nshe maintained contact with her creditors and attempted to negotiate partial payments to \nkeep debts current or payment plans for resolution of debt balances. Applicant admits that \nshe has not contacted her creditors about her old debts because she cannot afford to \nmake payments. She cannot reasonably be expected to make payments on her old debts \nwhen she is struggling to make the payments on the loan for the truck she is driving and \nwhen she is seriously behind on her bills with her current electricity provider. Yet one had \nto question the soundness of her financial judgment. By taking on mortgage payments of \n$1,750 per month in November 2020, Applicant and her spouse increased their living \nexpenses by $200 a month when their financial situation was already tenuous. She had to \nborrow against her retirement to pay debts to qualify for the mortgage and to make the \ndown payment for the house. They did not file their income tax return for tax year 2020, \nreportedly because they did not have the money to pay for tax help, even though they were \nemployed at the time. \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 20(c) and 20(d) are only applicable to the fitness club debt in SOR \u00b6 1.f, \nwhich Applicant credibly testified has been paid. The other debts in the SOR have not been \nresolved, and Applicant presently has no payment plans established for those debts. An \napplicant is not required to show that he or she has paid off each debt in the SOR, or that \nthe debts in the SOR be paid first. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 02-25499 at 2 (App. Bd. Jun. \n5, 2006). That being said, the Appeal Board has also held that an applicant must \ndemonstrate \u201ca plan for debt payment, accompanied by concomitant conduct, that is, \nconduct that evidences a serious intent to resolve the debts.\u201d See ADP Case No. 17-00263 \nat 4 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2018) (citing, e.g., ISCR Case No. 16-03889 at 5 (App. Bd. Aug. 9, \n2018)). A promise to pay a debt at some future date is not a substitute for a track record of \ntimely debt payments or otherwise financially responsible behavior. See ISCR Case No, \n07-13041 at 4 (App. Bd. Sep. 2008). Applicant has not made enough progress toward \nresolving her old delinquencies to apply AG \u00b6 20(c) or AG \u00b6 20(d). Moreover, while she had \nsome financial counseling, it was more than a decade ago, and is of little probative value in \nlight of her ongoing financial difficulties. \nConcerning AG \u00b6 20(g), Applicant has apparently always overpaid her federal \nincome taxes, and she suspects that would be the case with respect to tax years 2020 and \n2021. Nonetheless, without some effort on her part showing that she filed her delinquent \ntax returns and owes no taxes, AG \u00b6 20(g) does not apply. \nWhole-Person Concept \nIn assessing the whole person, the administrative judge must consider the totality of \nApplicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant circumstances in light of the nine adjudicative process \nfactors in AG \u00b6 2(d). Those factors are: \n12 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances \nsurrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the \nfrequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at \nthe time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which participation is voluntary; (6) \nthe presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral \nchanges; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, \ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or \nrecurrence. \nThe analysis under Guideline F is incorporated in my whole-person analysis. Some \nof the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were addressed under that guideline, but some warrant \nadditional comment. \nApplicant is a longtime defense-contractor employee whose financial situation has\nbeen compromised by her spouse\u2019s lack of consistent employment over the years due to \ninjury and other unforeseen events. The $6,104 debt is for unpaid utility charges incurred \nwhile she lived in the house that she lost to foreclosure in 2010. The accident that totaled \nher vehicle in 2013 caused the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.b and led her to obtain the car loan in SOR \n\u00b6 1.a. Her subsequent default of that car loan in 2015 was largely due to the loss of \nhousehold income after her spouse injured his back and became addicted to painkillers. \nThe charged-off balance of $14,391 was continuing to adversely affect her credit as of April \n2019, and the creditor made some effort to collect the debt, although not recently. In the \nabsence of any recent collection efforts by the SOR creditors, the debts may no longer be \na source of financial pressure for Applicant. \n \nThe Appeal Board has held that the security clearance adjudication is not a \nproceeding aimed at collecting an applicant\u2019s personal debts. Rather, it is a proceeding \naimed at evaluating an applicant\u2019s judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness with regard to \nhis fitness or suitability to handle classified information appropriately. See ISCR Case No. \n09-02160 (App. Bd. June 21, 2010). It is not intended as punishment for past \nshortcomings. Applicant asserts that she would never compromise her job to resolve her \nfinancial situation, which is still under some stress. She was recently promoted with an \nincrease in salary, which reflects positively on her and her dedication to her employer. \nEven with that increase, it has taken her 35 years to reach her current annual salary of \nabout $60,000. She is in a catch-22 situation in that she needs her job to pay her old debts. \nAppendix C of Security Executive Agent Directive (SEAD) 4 grants DOHA \nadministrative judge\u2019s the discretionary authority to grant initial or continued eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance despite the presence of an issue(s) that can be partially but not \ncompletely mitigated with the provision of additional security measures. See, also, \nMemorandum, Director for Defense Intelligence (Intelligence and Security), dated January \n12, 2018, (\u201cAppendix C identifies authorized exceptions that are to be utilized when making \nadjudicative decisions to grant initial or continued eligibility for access to classified \ninformation or to hold a sensitive position. . . Effective immediately, authority to grant \nclearance eligibility with one of the exceptions enumerated within Appendix C is granted to \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n13 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nany adjudicative, hearing, or appeal official or entity now authorized to grant clearance \neligibility when they have jurisdiction to render the eligibility determination.\u201d) \nAfter carefully considering and weighing the financial considerations security \nconcerns, I decline to exercise the discretionary authority under Appendix C at this time. \nIndividuals with security clearance eligibility are held to a standard of good judgment, \nreliability, and trustworthiness which may require her or him to make choices that are \npersonally difficult or disadvantageous. Applicant was asked on her May 2017 about any \ndelinquent debts, repossessions, or unfiled tax returns. She was current in her tax filings at \nthat point, but knew that she had defaulted on the payments on the car loan in SOR \u00b6 1.a. \nShe likely knew that she had defaulted on the fitness club debt as it was in collections \nstatus as of June 2017. She was on notice on receipt of the SOR in March or April 2020, if \nnot in May 2017, that unresolved delinquencies were an issue for the DOD. While I \nrecognize that the many financial setbacks Applicant has incurred over the years have an \nemotional toll, she did not provide enough evidence in mitigation to overcome the financial \nconsiderations security concerns. \nIt is well settled that once a concern arises regarding an applicant\u2019s security \nclearance eligibility, there is strong presumption against the grant or renewal of a security \nclearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th  Cir. 1990). Based on the \nevidence of record, it is not clearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant \nor continue security clearance eligibility for Applicant at this time. This decision should not \nbe construed as a determination that Applicant cannot in the future attain the reform \nnecessary to establish her security worthiness, especially if she is able to provide a track \nrecord of financial stability. Persuasive evidence of Applicant\u2019s security worthiness is \nlacking at this time. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the amended \nSOR, as required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.e: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.f: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.g: \nAgainst Applicant \n14 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n_____________________ \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances, it is not clearly consistent with the interests of \nnational security to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance. Eligibility \nfor access to classified information is denied. \nElizabeth M. Matchinski \nAdministrative Judge \n15 \n",

When interviewed in 2017, he told the investigator he could not answer \nhis phone because his spouse had \u201cconfiscated\u201d his cell phone. He also traveled to \nMexico with his spouse to visit her family, but she did not return with him and he was not \nsure she would return. He noted that they were not getting along, and therefore, he was \nunable to provide financial information. When he asked her about finances, she \u201conly yells \nat him\u201d and she \u201cis taking all the money from their joint account\u201d and he \u201ccan only assume \nthat she is paying bills.\u201d He and his spouse are not separated, but he noted during the \ninterview that he did not think their car or mortgage payments were being made. In 2016, \nhe caught her having an affair with another man, and in 2017, Applicant and his spouse \nhad a physical altercation over his accusations that she was visiting dating websites. (GE \n6) \nApplicant purchased a home in state A in 2006. He noted in his 2017 interview that \nhe had not made a payment on his mortgage since 2010. (GE 6) More recently, he was \nnotified in 2019 that the home would be foreclosed on. In an effort to forestall the \nforeclosure, he filed Chapter 13 bankruptcy in September 2019 to force the mortgage \ncompany to restructure or modify the mortgage. He lives in State B, and stated that he is \ntrying to \u201cget my family out of the house in [State A] so that it can be sold.\u201d (Ans.) He \nclaimed $555,651 in secured payments, and $189,004 in unsecured payments. No \nprincipal or interest was paid. (GE 2) The bankruptcy was dismissed in June 2020. \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d and 1.e involve student loans. Applicant obtained student loans in \n1995 to 1999 that were later consolidated. He did not begin to pay them until 2009. While \nunemployed, he did not contact his loan servicing companies regarding his financial \nstatus and left his student loans unaddressed from 2009 to 2020. He testified that the \nloans are now rehabilitated and current. He claimed that he has been paying on the loans \nsince 2019, and that they are not currently in default. Applicant provided a letter from a \nloan servicing company alleged in the SOR, dated October 29, 2021, stating that his \nrehabilitated loan has been with student loan servicer N for a few months, and they were \ninquiring to see if he had \u201cwhat you need to stay on track repaying your federal student \nloan.\u201d (AE I) He testified that he made his first payment in December 2021, and will start \nautomatic payments of $360 per month in January 2022, but he was unsure of the exact \namount.

He testified that he called the DOE in late December 2021, and left a \nmessage, but has not contacted them since and remains unaware of the DOE debt. His \n2017 credit report shows a DOE deferred student loan, and his 2021 credit report shows \nthe DOE account in collections with $6,300 past due. (GEs 4 and 5) \nRegarding SOR \u00b6 1.g that alleges a past-due car loan, Applicant noted in his 2017 \ninterview, that he purchased a car in 2008, but that he had not made a payment on it \nsince 2010. (GE 6) He testified that the SOR debt was for a car loan for his spouse, and \nthe car was destroyed. He claimed the insurance company took the car and paid the loan. \nApplicant listed the debt in his Chapter 13 bankruptcy filing, but has not inquired about \nthe status of the loan with the creditor. Applicant\u2019s February 2021 credit report shows he \nwas about four payments past due at that time, and owes a total of $33,805. No \nindependent documentation showing the current status of the loan or any insurance \npayoff was provided. \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.h \u2013 1.j allege state tax liens from two states, and SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.k and 1.l are \ntax debts owed to the Federal government. Applicant was aware of the debts in \nSeptember 2019 as they were included in his Chapter 13 bankruptcy filing. He testified \nthat he was taxed in each state that has filed liens, but did not believe he owed taxes. He \nclaimed that he lived in state B from 2004 to 2006, and was aware of his tax obligations \nin 2016. He claimed his income taxes were paid by a consulting company. He \nacknowledged living and working in state A from 2006 to 2019, and failed to file state A \nincome tax returns for tax years 2006 to 2009. He claimed a tax preparer told him in 2016 \nor 2017 that he did not have to file returns that were over 10 years old. \nApplicant testified that he did not have income in 2010 or 2011, so he did not file \nany tax returns. He claimed he filed state and Federal tax returns in 2012, but did not \nremember if he owed any tax, but believes he always received a refund from returns that \nwere filed. He also testified that he believes he filed Federal tax returns for tax years 2013 \nto 2020, and thinks he received refunds. He claimed that he has paid Federal taxes owed, \nbut did not provide IRS transcripts or other evidence of payments. Applicant\u2019s 2017 credit \nreport shows tax liens since 2010. (GE 5) He could not recall getting any tax debt notices. \nOf note, Applicant\u2019s financial plan, submitted after the hearing, shows his denial of tax \ndebt allegations, but does not explain any action taken with regard to the debts. He also \ndoes not have an allocation toward tax debts in his budget. He testified that he found out \nin 2016 that he did not file Federal and state tax returns from 2006 to 2009. He spoke to \nstate A tax authority the week of his hearing, and said he made arrangements to resubmit \nunfiled tax returns. He stated that he intends to refile tax returns for 2006 to 2009 in state \nA, 2005 or 2006 in state B, and 2005 to 2009 Federal returns after the hearing. After the \nhearing, Applicant submitted a copy of a check for $1,047, dated January 2, 2022, \napparently written to pay a state A tax assessment from November 4, 2021.

He stopped \nmaking payments in 2011 and he assumed the home was repossessed and the loan \nforeclosed. He did not believe he owed any remaining balance. However, he had done \nnothing to address the debt or confirm its status. The other judgment was for a finance \ncompany debt. He testified that he was unaware of the judgment or the basis of the debt, \nbut had not contacted the creditor nor made any effort to determine its status. \nApplicant provided several character letters from coworkers, a long-standing \nfriend, and his son who is serving in the Navy, attesting to the importance of his job, his \nloyalty, and the lack of security incidents or other behaviors that would make him a risk \nto national security. Of note, the letters appear to use similar language and format, and \nnone discuss his financial history. He also provided many educational and employment \nawards and certificates. He has cash assets of about $6,000 to $8,000, and a 401k \nretirement account valued at $70,000, however he borrowed $7,000 to $10,000 from it in \n2020. He had financial counseling in 1995 and presumably in 2019, coincident with his \nbankruptcy filings. \nPolicies \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 2. \nNational security eligibility is predicated upon the applicant meeting the criteria \ncontained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. \nInstead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge applies \nthese guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative \njudge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider a person\u2019s stability, trustworthiness, reliability, \ndiscretion, character, honesty, and judgment. AG \u00b6 1(b). \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec.

Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \u201cSubstantial \nevidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. Washington \nMetro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines presume a \nnexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria listed \ntherein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 12-01295 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Jan. 20, 2015). \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, \nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. \n02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01- \n20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see, AG \u00b6 1(d). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nThe security concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. . . . \nThe relevant disqualifying conditions under AG \u00b6 19 include: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \nApplicant\u2019s admissions, testimony, and the documentary evidence in the record \nare sufficient to establish the disqualifying conditions AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a), (c), and (f). Although \nApplicant\u2019s failure to file tax returns was not specifically alleged in the SOR, his unalleged \nconduct may be considered to decide whether a particular adjudicative guideline is \napplicable, to evaluate evidence of extenuation, mitigation, or changed circumstances, or \nas part of a whole-person analysis. ISCR Case No. 03-20327 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, \n2006). I have considered Applicant\u2019s failure to timely file state and federal tax returns for \nthese limited purposes. \nThe following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially relevant: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue; and  \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority \nto file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \nApplicant has a long history of financial irresponsibility. He has had debt \naccumulation and a history of avoidance of tax obligations to include an inability or \nunwillingness to comply with income tax filing requirements and payment of taxes owed. \nHe has shown little concurrent effort to resolve his financial obligations until his security \neligibility was in jeopardy. He has alleged substantial medical concerns that prevented \nhis from working or maintaining employment, and I give him the benefit of the doubt that \nhis medical problems impacted his finances. However, he has done little to address his \ndebts and delinquent tax obligations.

A person who is financially \nirresponsible may also be irresponsible, unconcerned, or negligent in handling and \nsafeguarding classified information. See ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, \n2012). Failure to comply with tax laws suggests that an applicant has a problem with \nabiding by well-established government rules and systems. Voluntary compliance with \nrules and systems is essential for protecting classified information. See, e.g., ISCR Case \nNo. 16-01726 at 5 (App. Bd. Feb. 28, 2018). A person who fails repeatedly to fulfill his or \nher legal obligations, such as filing tax returns and paying taxes when due, does not \ndemonstrate the high degree of good judgment and reliability required of those granted \naccess to classified information. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 17-01382 at 4 (App. Bd. May \n16, 2018). \nApplicant stated that he intends to file delinquent tax returns and pay tax debts if \nowed, but has done too little, too late. Intentions to pay debts in the future are not a \nsubstitute for a track record of debt repayment or other responsible approaches. See \nISCR Case No. 11-14570 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct. 23, 2013). There is insufficient evidence for \na determination that Applicant\u2019s financial problems will be resolved within a reasonable \nperiod and that he can obtain and maintain a measure of financial responsibility. His \nfinancial issues continue to cast doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, and good \njudgment. \nOverall, Applicant\u2019s financial responsibility is questionable, and he has a poor track \nrecord with respect to Federal and state income tax compliance. He had many years to \nresolve his tax obligations, yet allowed them to remain unresolved until his security \nclearance was jeopardized. Even then, he was slow to respond to the red flags raised \nabout his tax delinquencies and other debts since completing his SCA and during the \ninvestigation process. He may have to wrest control of his finances from his spouse, but \nin any event, the record reflects a failure to show reasonable knowledge and ultimate \ncontrol of his finances. Despite some conditions outside of his control, a payment to a \nstate tax authority, and some financial counseling, no mitigation credit fully applies. \nApplicant\u2019s meager efforts were too late to establish financial responsibility and a reliable \ntrack record of debt resolution. Based on the record presented, I am not convinced he \nfully grasps the reality of his financial obligations or has taken full responsibility for his \nfinancial situation. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder AG \u00b6\u00b6 2(a), 2(c), and 2(d), the ultimate determination of whether to grant \nnational security eligibility must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. Under the whole-person \nconcept, the administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security \nclearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n_______________________ \ncircumstances.

I have incorporated my findings of fact \nand comments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. I also considered \nApplicant\u2019s employment history, periods of unemployment, military service, medical \nissues and family responsibilities.

He previously worked for other government contractors from 2002 to April 2004, when he was laid off. He was unemployed from April 2004 to February 2005, and again worked for government contractors from 2005 to 2007. Applicant attended college, but did not earn a degree. He has two technical diplomas from 1997 and 2019. He was married in 1997 and divorced in 2004. He again married in 2007 and divorced in 2012.

An amended notice of hearing was issued on \nNovember 16, 2021, and the hearing was convened on December 7, 2021. \nGovernment Exhibits (GE) 1 through 11 were admitted into evidence without \nobjection. Applicant testified but had no exhibits to submit. The record was held open until \nDecember 31, 2021, to permit Applicant to submit documentary evidence. Applicant \nsubmitted Applicant Exhibit (AE) A, which included various financial statements, IRS \npayment documents, and state tax returns. DOHA received the hearing transcript on \nDecember 13, 2021. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant is a 52-year-old senior systems administrator for a government \ncontractor, employed since November 2007. He previously worked for other government \ncontractors from 2002 to April 2004, when he was laid off. He was unemployed from April \n2004 to February 2005, and again worked for government contractors from 2005 to 2007. \nApplicant attended college, but did not earn a degree. He has two technical diplomas \nfrom 1997 and 2019. He was married in 1997 and divorced in 2004. He again married in \n2007 and divorced in 2012. He married again in 2013, and has two children (15 and 23) \nthat do not live with him. Applicant has held a secret security clearance since 2007. \nThe SOR alleges under Guideline F that Applicant failed to timely file his federal \nand state income tax returns for tax years 2002-2006, and 2010 to 2016 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and \n1.b); that he is indebted to the IRS for tax years 2005, 2008, and 2010 to 2017 totaling \nabout $101,570 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c through 1.l); that he is indebted to state A on liens filed for \ntax years 2016 to 2018 (2 allegations) totaling about $82,316; a home foreclosure in 2012; \ntwo medical debts (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.q through s); and that he filed Chapter 13 bankruptcy in \n2011 with $450,000 in liabilities, that was dismissed in September 13, 2013 for failure to \nmake payments (SOR \u00b6 1.t). The Government withdrew the Guideline E allegations at \nthe hearing. Applicant admitted SOR allegations \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.p, and 1.t, and denied \nallegations \u00b6\u00b6 1.q and 1.s. The Government\u2019s exhibits support the Guideline F allegations. \nThe record evidence shows that Applicant\u2019s finances have been a subject of \ninquiry by the government for several years. Applicant responded to government \ninterrogatories regarding his finances in 2017 and 2019. He was interviewed by a \ngovernment investigator in 2018. Applicant and his second spouse filed Chapter 13 \nbankruptcy in June 2011 after purchasing a home. The case was dismissed in September \n2013. As part of the filing, he attested to the court in June 2011, that he had filed his \nfederal income tax returns for tax years 2007 to 2010. However, the evidence shows that \nhis TY 2010 return was filed in 2015. He stated that he did not qualify to file Chapter 13 \naction on his own. His property taxes ballooned and he could not meet his financial \nobligations. He also owed on tax debts. He claimed he made payments under the Chapter \n13 repayment plan, but his spouse did not cooperate and stopped voluntary payments. \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant paid child support for two children through 2017. He testified that the IRS \ndeemed him uncollectable in 2012 or 2013, because of his $2,000 per month child support \nobligations. When his oldest child turned 18 years old, Applicant\u2019s tax advocate \nrepresentative requested the IRS agree to an offer in compromise, but it was denied. The \nIRS instead offered an installment agreement. The agreement was put in place in \nDecember 2019, and Applicant has been paying $371 per month since then. His current \nagreement was renewed in November 2020. He owes the IRS between $118,000 - \n$120,000.

He testified that he did not file tax returns on time \nbecause of financial hardships and he did not have enough taxes withheld from his \npaycheck. Late filing of tax returns, underpayment of 2020 taxes, or other information not \nalleged in the SOR will not be considered for disqualifying purposes, but may be \nconsidered when making a credibility determination, in the application of mitigating \nconditions, and in a whole-person analysis. \nApplicant testified that he lived in state A between 2004 and 2006, and from \nNovember 2011 to August 2016, and believed he filed state tax returns as required, but \nhad to \u201crefile\u201d them as he could not determine the state received them. In his post-hearing \nsubmission, Applicant provided a 2019 letter from his state tax accountant, noting that \nApplicant asked him to prepare state tax returns \u201cfor prior years.\u201d Applicant provided \nunsigned and undated state tax returns for tax years 2005-2007, and 2013. He testified \nthat he filed state tax returns for 2012 to 2015 in December 2020. He believed that his \nstate tax obligations were covered under his IRS installment agreement, but later learned \nit did not.

The medical debts were \nlast reflected on his 2019 credit report, but do not appear on his 2021 credit report. He \nattended mandatory credit counseling in 2011 as required by the bankruptcy court, he \nhas not received counseling assistance since. \nApplicant earns about $108,000 per year, and his spouse earns about $89,000 per \nyear. Despite this sizable household income, they live \u201cpaycheck to paycheck.\u201d He has \nabout $936 in savings and $259 in checking accounts. He continues to pay about $800 \nper month in child support and owes for the next two years. He bought a home in 2016 \nwith a down payment from a $20,000 loan against his 401k retirement plan. He owed \nabout $40,000 in credit card accounts. He and his spouse owe about $106,000 in student \nloans (Applicant has about $6,000 of the debt). Applicant recently made home \nimprovements and owes at least $10,000. Applicant took vacations in 2014 to 2019 to \nBahamas, Mexico (4 times), Dominican Republic, Jamaica, West Indies, and Dubai, but \nclaims his brother paid for most of the trips as gifts. \nPolicies \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 2. \nNational security eligibility is predicated upon the applicant meeting the criteria \ncontained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. \nInstead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge applies \nthese guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative \njudge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider a person\u2019s stability, trustworthiness, reliability, \ndiscretion, character, honesty, and judgment. AG \u00b6 1(b). \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \n\u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \u201cSubstantial \nevidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. Washington \nMetro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines presume a \nnexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria listed \ntherein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 12-01295 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Jan. 20, 2015). \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, \nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government.

He has had significant debt \naccumulation, failed to comply with a Chapter 13 bankruptcy payment plan, and has a \nhistory of avoidance of tax obligations to include an inability or unwillingness to comply \nwith income tax filing requirements and payment of taxes owed. He has shown little \nconcurrent effort to resolve his financial obligations, waiting to begin addressing them only \nafter his security eligibility was in jeopardy. \nApplicant has not submitted sufficient or persuasive evidence to show how his past \nfinancial and personal issues impeded his ability to file federal income tax returns and \npay taxes as required.

Cafeteria & Restaurant \nWorkers Union, Local 473 v. McElroy, 284 F.2d 173, 183 (D.C. Cir. 1960), \naff\u2019d, 367 U.S. 886 (1961). Failure to comply with federal tax laws suggests \nthat an applicant has a problem with abiding by well-established \ngovernment rules and regulations. Voluntary compliance with rules and \nregulations is essential for protecting classified information. See, e.g., \nISCR Case No. 14-04437 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 15, 2016). \nHis financial problems have been longstanding and remain a concern. Although \nApplicant has a federal income tax repayment plan, he has sizable debts despite a long\u00ad\nstanding work history with defense contractors and a substantial household income. His \nstate income tax liens remain largely unaddressed, and he did not file late tax returns until \nafter they became an issue for his security clearance. His claim that his ex-spouse did \nnot cooperate in his Chapter 13 bankruptcy requirements ring hollow. He has shown a \ndisregard for federal and state tax obligations. He has little in financial assets to use to \npay debts. He has clearly prioritized buying a house and traveling on vacations over his \nfinancial obligations. I give mitigating credit for resolution of his small medical debts, and \nthe time has passed since his Chapter 13 bankruptcy. However, his federal and state \nincome tax obligations have not been sufficiently mitigated given the number of years of \nnon-compliance and disregard. \nDespite Applicant\u2019s payment plan with the IRS, I continue to have concerns about \nhis overall financial responsibility, and willingness to comply with future income tax \nobligations. He earns a substantial salary, as does his spouse, and together they have a \nsizable household income, however, they live paycheck to paycheck with little ability to \nsave money. However, he appears to have sufficient money to travel. Overall, Applicant\u2019s \nfinancial responsibility is questionable and he has done little on his own initiative to get a \nhandle on his finances. Although he attended mandatory financial counseling when he \nfiled bankruptcy in 2011, he has done nothing since. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder AG \u00b6\u00b6 2(a), 2(c), and 2(d), the ultimate determination of whether to grant \nnational security eligibility must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. Under the whole-person \nconcept, the administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security \nclearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process \nfactors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d). \nI considered all of the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my findings of fact \nand comments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. I also considered \nApplicant\u2019s employment history and difficulty with his ex-spouse. I remain unconvinced of \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n_______________________ \nhis overall financial responsibility, and his ability, intent, and desire to meet his financial \nobligations in the future, especially in tax compliance. \nAccordingly, I conclude Applicant has not carried his burden of showing that it is \nclearly consistent with the national security interest of the United States to grant him \neligibility for access to classified information. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \n \n \nAGAINST A\n PPLICANT \n  Subparagraphs 1.a-1.p:   \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n  Subparagraphs 1.q-1.s:  \n \n \n \nFor Applicant  \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \n \n \n \nWITHDRAWN \n \nConclusion \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national security interest of the \nUnited States to grant Applicant eligibility for access to classified information.

Applicant answered the SOR and requested a hearing (Answer). \nOn April 5, 2022, the case was assigned to me. On June 14, 2022, the Defense \nOffice of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Notice of Hearing, setting the case for \nJuly 14, 2022.

The \nmotion to amend was granted over Applicant\u2019s objection. (Tr. 99-101) \nFindings of Fact \nIn her answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted the allegations contained in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 \n1.a and 1.b.

In it, she did \nnot disclose that she used cocaine and marijuana while in high school. (Tr. 26-29; GE 2) \nShe did not include that information on the advice or her recruiter. She enlisted in the \nMarines when she turned 18 years old in 2011.

While there, she was sexually assaulted \ntwice. (Tr. 38) In 2013, Applicant received an Article 15 or nonjudicial punishment (NJP) \nfor wrongful interference with an adverse administrative proceeding. (Tr. 47) She was \nreduced from an E-3 to E-2 and was denied reenlistment. She left the Marines in 2015, \nand went to the Marine Corps Reserve until 2016. (Tr. 47, 50-52; GE 4) \nAfter returning to the states in 2014, Applicant used Ecstasy (Molly), an illegal drug, \nwith a friend who gave it to her. She used it twice between 2014 and the time she left the \nMarines in 2015. She used it to \u201cnumb\u201d herself from past traumas (including sexual \nassaults) and her distress over leaving the Marine Corps. She held a security clearance \nat the time.

She estimated she used it five \nseparate times during her service. She held a security clearance at that time. (Tr. 72, 78-\n79) After leaving the Marine Corps Reserve in 2016, she used it twice with a former \nboyfriend between July 2017 and August 2017. She never purchased marijuana. (Tr. 81-\n82; GE 4)  \nFrom August 2017 to July 2020 Applicant worked for a defense contractor. She \ndeployed to the Middle East to provide assistance to the contractor\u2019s management teams. \n(Tr. 53) She continues to work for the contractor on a part-time basis. Currently, she works \nfulltime for a non-profit organization that provides mental health services to veterans. (Tr. \n22, 64-65) \nIn October 2017, Applicant submitted her second security clearance application \n(SCA-2), after starting the above position with a defense contractor. In it, she disclosed \nthat she used marijuana from June 2008, while in high school, to August 2017, which was \na month before she started her position with the defense contractor. She disclosed that \nshe used Ecstasy between 2014 and 2017. (Tr. 67; GE 1 at 35-36) In December 2017, \nher security clearance was suspended pending this investigation. (GE 3) \nWhile testifying Applicant disclosed that she smoked marijuana, one time, with a \nfriend in August 2022, about two months before the hearing. She was having trouble \nsleeping and decided to use it. (Tr. 85) She regrets her decision. She knew at that time \nshe was going to appear at this hearing. (Tr. 86, 94) She also believed that it was \nimportant to be honest about her drug use. (Tr. 61) \nApplicant submitted a statement in which she acknowledged her past use of \nmarijuana, cocaine, and Ecstasy, and her intention not to use illegal drugs in the future. \nIf she were granted a security clearance, she agreed to an automatic revocation of it if \nshe involved herself in future substance abuse. (AE G) \nApplicant has not participated in a substance abuse program. (Tr. 90) She has not \nsought treatment for her history of childhood abuse or post-traumatic stress disorder \n(PTSD), which a psychiatrist recently diagnosed during a disability interview. The \npsychiatrist recommended that she participate in therapy and try medication. To date, she \nhas not followed through with that medical advice.

In addition to brief introductory explanations for each guideline, \nthe AG list potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used \nin evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in AG \u00b6 2, describing the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known \nas the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere \nspeculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 states an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nFinally, as emphasized in Section 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \n\u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty \nof the applicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple \nprerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information). \n4 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAnalysis \nGuideline H: Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nAG \u00b6 24 describes the concerns related to the illegal use of controlled \nsubstances, to include the misuse of prescription and non-prescription \ndrugs, and the use of other substances that cause physical or mental \nimpairment or are used in a manner inconsistent with their intended purpose \ncan raise questions about an individual's reliability and trustworthiness, both \nbecause such behavior may lead to physical or psychological impairment \nand because it raises questions about a person's ability or willingness to \ncomply with laws, rules, and regulations. Controlled substance means any \n\"controlled substance\" as defined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is \nthe generic term adopted in this guideline to describe any of the behaviors \nlisted above. \nAG \u00b6 25 sets out three conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying in this case: \n(a) any substance misuse (see above definition);  \n(c) illegal possession of a controlled substance, including cultivation, \nprocessing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of  \ndrug paraphernalia; and \n(f) any illegal drug use while granted access to classified information or \nholding a sensitive position. \nApplicant has a history of possessing and using illegal substances. She admitted \nthat between June 2008 and August 2017, she illegally possessed and used marijuana, \nstarting while she was in high school and continuing into her military service and \nsubsequent to her discharge in 2016. She used it while holding a security clearance. \nShe also illegally used Ecstasy between July 2014 and January 2015, while holding a \nsecurity clearance. Applicant honestly disclosed that she used marijuana to help her \nsleep two months prior to this hearing. There is no evidence that she used illegal drugs \nwhile granted access to classified information. The evidence establishes AG \u00b6\u00b6 25(a) \nand 25(c), but not 25(f). \nAG \u00b6 26 lists conditions that could mitigate security concerns raised under this \nguideline: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened\nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; and\n \n \n5 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and substance \nmisuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and \nhas established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not limited to: \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; \nand \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that any future \ninvolvement or misuse is grounds for revocation of national security \neligibility; and \n \n \n \n (d) satisfactory completion of a prescribed drug treatment program,\nincluding, but not limited to, rehabilitation and aftercare requirements,\nwithout recurrence of abuse, and a favorable prognosis by a duly qualified\nmedical professional. \nThere is insufficient evidence to establish the above mitigating conditions. \nApplicant has a history of illegally using and possessing marijuana from 2008 up to her \nrecent use two months before her hearing in October 2022. She also illegally used \nEcstasy twice between 2014 and 2015. There is insufficient evidence to establish \nmitigation under AG \u00b6 26(a), given that recent usage. She acknowledges her misconduct, \nbut she has not established a solid pattern of abstinence, as required under AG \u00b6 26(b). \nShe provided a September 25, 2022 letter stating her intention to abstain from future \nillegal drug use. This document is given limited weight based on her use of marijuana in \nAugust 2022. AG \u00b6 26(b)(c) does not apply. Applicant has not completed a drug treatment \nprogram and has not received a favorable prognosis from a health care professional. AG \n\u00b6 26(d) does not apply. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation\nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct;\n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the\nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n6 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n                 \n \n  \n                                           \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n__________________ \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), \u201c[t]he ultimate determination\u201d of whether to grant a security \nclearance \u201cmust be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines\u201d and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \npertinent facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant is an intelligent, \ncompetent and candid woman, who has worked hard to overcome some of the difficulties \nshe experienced in early life and into adulthood. She joined the Marines in an attempt to \nchange her environment and achieve success. According to her character references, \nshe is a competent and dedicated person, who is forthright. \nDuring her testimony, Applicant courageously disclosed that she used marijuana \na month or so prior to her hearing. She did that with full knowledge of the negative \nrepercussion it could have on her pursuit of a security clearance. Her honesty is \nadmirable. After listening to her testify and observing her demeanor, I believe that she \nrecognizes her need for professional help with her past struggles and that she has the \nfortitude to address them. At this time, she did not mitigate the security concerns raised \nunder the guideline for drug involvement and substance misuse. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline H:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a and 1.b: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.c:    \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for access to \nclassified information.

Karoian, Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro Se \n01/04/2022 \nDecision \nMETZ, John Grattan, Jr., Administrative Judge: \nBased on the File of Relevant Material (FORM), Items 1-14, I deny Applicant\u2019s \nclearance. \nOn 19 November 2019, the Department of Defense (DoD) sent Applicant a \nStatement of Reasons (SOR) raising security concerns under Guideline F, Financial \nConsiderations, and Guideline E, Personal Conduct.1 Applicant timely answered the SOR, \nrequesting a decision without hearing by the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals \n(DOHA). The record closed 6 May 2021, the day Applicant\u2019s response to the FORM was \ndue. Applicant provided no additional documentation. DOHA assigned the case to me 24 \nJune 2021. \n1DoD acted under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information Within Industry (February \n20, 1960), as amended; DoD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review \nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and Security Executive Agent Directive 4, effective on \n8 June 2017. \n1 \n\nFindings of Fact \nApplicant admitted the SOR allegations. He is a 35-year-old field technician \nemployed by a U.S. defense contractor since about April 2018. He was is employed by his \nclearance sponsor in a similar position from July 2014 to March 2018. He initially was given \na clearance during his honorable active-duty service in the U.S. military from about \nDecember 2008 to about October 2012. He married in August 2009, and has a seven-\nyear-old daughter. \nThe SOR alleges, Items 4-5 establish, and Applicant admits, 14 delinquent debts \ntotaling nearly $38,000. The bulk of the debt consists of $18,679 for overpayments made \nto Applicant on his military accounts (SOR 1.a) and $14,164 for a repossessed automobile \n(SOR 1.b). The remaining debts are for unpaid rent, two medical bills, two cable providers, \nand a consumer credit account. He attributes his debts to a period of underemployment \nfollowing his discharge from active duty, but has not otherwise provided details about the \norigination of the debts or any efforts to resolve them. \nApplicant reported no delinquent debts on his 15 March 2018 clearance application \n(Item 3). During a 5 April 2019 interview with a Government investigator (Item 7), Applicant \ninitially denied having any delinquent debts, but was confronted with SOR debts 1.b-1.c \nand 1.f-1.h based on his 13 March 2018 credit report (Item 6). He claimed to have been \nunaware of the debts, but said he would check his credit report. He later reported to the \ninvestigator that the debts were his, and he would make arrangements to pay the debts \nwithin 60 days. He has documented no actions to resolve these debts. Applicant previously \nhad been confronted with delinquent debts (later resolved) during a 21 October 2011 \ninterview with a Government investigator (Item 11), involving unpaid parking tickets which \nhis mother later paid [15 September 2011 credit report (Item 10); 31 December 2008 credit \nreport (Item 13)]. Applicant was also the subject of a 16 February 2021 incident report under \nthe DoD Continuous Evaluation Program (Item 14), showing $19,444 in delinquent debt on \na 7 January 2021 credit report, including SOR debts 1.b-1.e and 1.h, and two debts not \nalleged in the SOR. \nApplicant\u2019s Answer stated his intent to variously arrange repayment plans (SOR 1.a-\n1.b, 1.h), arrange payment plan and pay within six months (SOR 1.c), resolve within 90 \ndays (SOR 1.d-1.f), and resolve within 30 days (SOR 1.g). He provided no evidence that \nhe had undertaken any of the promised actions. He provided no evidence of financial or \ncredit counseling, or a budget. He provided no work or character references, or evidence \nof any community involvement. He provided no evidence of his current financial situation, \nincluding his income, living expenses, and debts. \nPolicies \nThe adjudicative guidelines (AG) list factors for evaluating a person\u2019s suitability for \naccess to classified information. Administrative judges must assess disqualifying and \nmitigating conditions under each issue fairly raised by the facts and situation presented. \nEach decision must also reflect a fair, impartial, and commonsense consideration of the \n2 \n\n \nfactors listed in AG \u00a7 2(d). Any one disqualifying or mitigating condition is not, by itself, \nconclusive. However, specific adjudicative guidelines should be followed where a case \ncan be measured against them, as they represent policy guidance governing access to \nclassified information. Considering the SOR allegations and the evidence as a whole, the \nrelevant adjudicative guidelines are Guideline F (Financial Considerations) and Guideline \nE (Personal Conduct). \nSecurity clearance decisions resolve whether it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant or continue an applicant\u2019s security clearance. The Government \nmust prove, by substantial evidence, controverted facts alleged in the SOR. If it does, the \nburden shifts to applicant to refute, extenuate, or mitigate the Government\u2019s case. \nBecause no one has a right to a security clearance, the applicant bears a heavy burden of \npersuasion. \nPersons with access to classified information enter into a fiduciary relationship with \nthe Government based on trust and confidence. Therefore, the Government has a \ncompelling interest in ensuring each applicant possesses the requisite judgement, \nreliability, and trustworthiness of those who must protect national interests as their own. \nThe \u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d standard compels resolution of any \nreasonable doubt about an applicant\u2019s suitability for access in favor of the Government.2 \nAnalysis \nThe Government established a case for disqualification under Guideline F, and \nApplicant did not mitigate the security concerns. Applicant has an extensive history of \nfinancial difficulties for which he did not undertake timely resolution.3 Applicant knew he \nhad significant delinquent debt since at least April 2019, yet has undertaken no \ndocumented efforts to resolve the debts. \nApplicant meets none of the mitigating conditions for financial considerations. The \nfinancial problems were recent, not infrequent, and not clearly due to circumstances \nunlikely to recur.4 Moreover, Applicant\u2019s financial problems were not documented to be \ndue to not circumstances beyond his control, and he was not responsible in addressing \nthe debts, even after his subject interviews.5 Applicant submitted no evidence to show \ncredit or financial counseling, or that his debt is being resolved.6 His belated effort does \n2See, Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518 (1988). \n3\u00a719(a) inability to satisfy debts; (b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so; (c) a \nhistory of not meeting financial obligations; \n4\u00a720(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such circumstances that \nit is unlikely to recur . . . \n5\u00a720(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s control . . . \nand the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n6\u00a720(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and there are clear indications \n3 \n\n________________________ \nnot constitute a good-faith effort to address his debts.7 Furthermore, Applicant provided \nno \u201cwhole-person\u201d evidence to mitigate the security concerns raised by his inaction his \ndebts. Accordingly, I conclude Guideline F against Applicant. \nThe Government established a case for disqualification under Guideline E, and \nApplicant failed to mitigate the security concerns. Given his experience with past \nbackground investigations, in which he had been confronted with other delinquent debt, I \nfind his statement that he did not remember any of his delinquent debt\u2014particularly his \nindebtedness on his military accounts\u2014not to be credible.8 No mitigating conditions are \nraised by the facts. Accordingly, I resolve Guideline E against Applicant. \nFormal Findings \nParagraph 1. Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs a-h: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2. Guideline E: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph a: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nUnder the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant. \nClearance denied. \nJOHN GRATTAN METZ, JR \nAdministrative Judge \nthat the problem is being resolved or is under control; \n7\u00a720(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \n8\u00a716(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant and material facts from any personnel \nsecurity questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar form used to conduct investigations, . . .

(GE 1 \u2013 GE 8; \nSOR Answer) \nIn her September 2018 OPM PSI, Applicant attributed her failure to timely file her \nFederal and state income tax returns since 2011 due to \u201cpersonal issues and trauma.\u201d \nHer husband lost his job in 2011 at a major hotel chain and was unemployed for a year. \nWhen he did find a job, it paid less than half of his previous salary. In January 2018, \nApplicant hired an accountant to prepare and file all of her past-due Federal and state \nincome tax returns. She told the investigator that her accountant filed all of her Federal \nincome returns in late spring 2018 and informed her that she owed $10,000 in back \nFederal taxes. The accountant had not filed Applicant\u2019s state income tax returns \nbecause he needed more information regarding her spouse\u2019s employment. In 2013 or \n2014, the IRS began garnishing Applicant\u2019s wages at $266 per pay period. In that same \nOPM PSI, Applicant stated that it was her intention to pay all of her Federal and state \nincome taxes owed. (September 2018 OPM PSI, GE 2; Tr.19-20) \nApplicant added in her September 2018 OPM PSI that she fell behind on her \nstudent loans and other debts due to \u201cvarious circumstances,\u201d among them her \nhusband\u2019s unemployment and subsequent decline in income, as noted. Also, \nApplicant\u2019s husband fathered a child out of wedlock ten years prior, and in 2013, he was \nrequired to pay $280 in monthly child support in addition to providing food and clothing \nfor the child. As of her hearing date, the child was 12 years old and, by an informal \narrangement, child support had risen to $600 a month. Applicant\u2019s husband also \nincurred expenses as a result of sharing joint custody with the child\u2019s mother. Lastly, \nApplicant claimed that she lost 25 family members in the last eight years and traveled to \nall of the funerals which were expenses she had not anticipated.

Also, her husband \u201clost another job at Christmas of 2017.\u201d (Tr. 25) Applicant \nclaimed those tax years were filed; however, the IRS returned her filings because she \n\u201cmissed a signature.\u201d She added that she returned her completed returns to the IRS and \nas soon as the IRS has finished processing her returns, she will go on a payment plan. \n(Tr. 25-26) \nDuring cross-examination, Applicant stated that she had not filed her 2019 and \n2020 Federal income tax returns, but was going to file them within weeks of the hearing. \nShe hopes that she does not owe any taxes for those years.

An \nofficial dispute will be filed no later than 2/28/2021; pending the processing of all final \ntax returns.\u201d (SOR Answer) In her hearing testimony, Applicant stated the amounts \nalleged were not accurate.

In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious \nscrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance \ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \n9 \n\n \n \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAnalysis \nFinancial Considerations \nAG \u00b6 18 articulates the security concern for financial problems: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds.    \nThe Appeal Board explained the scope and rationale for the financial \nconsiderations security concern in ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, \n2012) (citation omitted) as follows: \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an applicant might \nknowingly compromise classified information in order to raise money in \nsatisfaction of his or her debts. Rather, it requires a Judge to examine the \ntotality of an applicant\u2019s financial history and circumstances. The Judge \nmust consider pertinent evidence regarding the applicant\u2019s self-control, \njudgment, and other qualities essential to protecting the national secrets \nas well as the vulnerabilities inherent in the circumstances. The Directive \npresumes a nexus between proven conduct under any of the Guidelines \nand an applicant\u2019s security eligibility. \nAG \u00b6 19 includes three disqualifying conditions that could raise a security \nconcern and may be disqualifying in this case: \u201c(a) inability to satisfy debts;\u201d \u201c(c) a \nhistory of not meeting financial obligations;\u201d and \u201c(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing \nannual Federal, state, or local income tax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, \nor local income tax as required.\u201d The record establishes the disqualifying conditions in \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a), 19(c), and 19(f). Further inquiry is necessary about the potential \napplication of any mitigation conditions. \nThe financial considerations mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are as follows: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast\ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \n10 \n\n \n \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control; \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue; \n(f) the affluence resulted from a legal source of income; and \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax \nauthority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \nIn ISCR Case No. 10-04641 at 4 (App. Bd. Sept. 24, 2013), the DOHA Appeal \nBoard explained Applicant\u2019s responsibility for proving the applicability of mitigating \nconditions as follows:  \nOnce a concern arises regarding an Applicant\u2019s security clearance \neligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance \nof a security clearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th \nCir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991). After the Government \npresents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the \napplicant to rebut or mitigate those concerns. See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. The \nstandard applicable in security clearance decisions is that articulated in \n[full cite here] Egan, supra. \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being \nconsidered for access to classified information will be resolved in favor of \nthe national security.\u201d Directive, Enclosure 2 \u00b6 2(b). \nApplicant\u2019s conduct does not warrant full application of AG \u00b6 20(a) because there \nis more than one delinquent debt and her financial problems are not isolated. Her debt, \nparticularly as it pertains to her delinquent taxes, remains a \u201ccontinuing course of \nconduct\u201d under the Appeal Board\u2019s jurisprudence. See ISCR Case No. 07-11814 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Aug. 29, 2008) (citing ISCR Case No. 01-03695 (App. Bd.

The personal and family \nproblems that Applicant described beginning around 2011 to include her husband losing \nhis job, her husband\u2019s underemployment, expenses related to her husband\u2019s out of \nwedlock child, and deaths of 25 family members played a role in her ability to remain \ncurrent on her financial obligations. However, Applicant does not receive full credit \nunder either of these two mitigating conditions because of her failure to act responsibly \nunder the circumstances and the time elapsed before addressing these obligations. AG \n\u00b6 20(g) is partially applicable to SOR \u00b6 1.b insofar as Applicant has made some \nprogress towards her paying her 2014 delinquent taxes; however, her post-hearing \ndocuments are unclear insofar as the balance owed for 2014. Her post-hearing \ndocuments did not address her 2015 and 2016 delinquent taxes. AG \u00b6 20(e) is \napplicable to the debts she successfully disputed. AG \u00b6 20(f) is not applicable. \nOf great concern is the fact that Applicant did not timely file her Federal income \ntax returns for tax years 2010, 2017, and 2018. Not alleged, it also appears that \nApplicant did not timely file her 2019 and 2020 Federal income tax returns. And, she is \nalso indebted to the Federal Government for tax years 2014, 2015, and 2016 for \n$10,073. Applicant disputes this amount, but did not submit any documentation to verify \na lesser amount. She also acknowledged that her state income tax returns were not \ntimely filed for tax years 2019 and 2020. \nApplicant was alerted to the fact that her failure to file these returns and her \ndebts were a concern to the Government during her September 2018 OPM PSI and \nlater when she received her May 2020 SOR. These events apparently did not prompt \nApplicant to recognize the seriousness of her situation and take immediate corrective \naction. Documentation that her delinquent returns have been filed has not been \nreceived. Her explanation of being overwhelmed or distracted due to personal problems \nis not a convincing explanation given the time elapsed and taking into account \nApplicant\u2019s age, education, and experience. The evidence of record does not mitigate \nsuch a lapse in judgment. The evidence demonstrates that Applicant did not act \nresponsibly with regard to timely filing her Federal and state income tax returns and \npaying or making payment arrangements for taxes owed. \nIn regard to the failure to file timely Federal income tax returns when due, the \nDOHA Appeal Board has commented in ISCR Case No. 14-04437 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. \n15, 2016): \nFailure to file tax returns suggests that an applicant has a problem with \ncomplying with well-established governmental rules and systems. \nVoluntary compliance with such rules and systems is essential for \nprotecting classified information. ISCR Case No. 01-05340 at 3 (App. Bd. \nDec. 20, 2002). As we have noted in the past, a clearance adjudication is \nnot directed at collecting debts. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 07-08049 at 5 \n(App. Bd. Jul. 22, 2008). By the same token, neither is it directed toward \ninducing an applicant to file tax returns.

The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \nThe ultimate determination of whether to grant or continue national security \neligibility must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept. AG \u00b6 2(c). The discussion in the \nAnalysis section under Guideline F is incorporated in this whole-person section. \nHowever, further comments are warranted. \nApplicant is a 44-year-old senior supply chain specialist, who has been employed \nby a defense contractor since September 2007. She has spent a significant amount of \nher adult working life working for a defense contractor. She seeks to obtain a security \nclearance to enhance her position within her company. Her manager supports her in \nthis endeavor. Based on her manager\u2019s recommendation as well as her numerous \nawards and certificates of appreciation from her employer, it is clear that she is highly \nregarded in her industry. Applicant is married and has two adult daughters. She has all \nthe indicators of an upwardly mobile individual with a bright future ahead of her. \nHowever, for at least 11 years, Applicant has failed to grasp the importance of \none of the fundamental hallmarks of U.S. citizenship, which is the timely filing of her \nFederal and state income tax returns and paying taxes when due. This is especially \ncrucial for an individual seeking to retain a security clearance and working for a defense \n13 \n\n \n \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ncontractor advancing the national security of the United States. From the evidence \npresented, despite being made aware that the timely filing and payment of her Federal \nand state income tax returns was a security concern, Applicant failed to comply with this \nbasic and fundamental security obligation. She is a bright and talented individual, who is \nmore than capable of addressing her income tax problems in a responsible way. I gave \nmitigation credit to debts Applicant has resolved or is attempting to resolve where \npossible. She is to be commended for the progress she made in addressing those \ndebts. However, more remains to be done before gaining financial responsibility, \nespecially as it pertains to her taxes. This decision should not be construed as a \ndetermination that Applicant cannot or will not attain the state of reform necessary for \naward of a security clearance in the future. With more effort towards establishing a track \nrecord of financial responsibility, and a better track record of behavior consistent with \nher obligations, she may well be able to demonstrate persuasive evidence of her \nsecurity clearance worthiness. \nI take this position based on the law, as set forth in Department of Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518 (1988), my careful consideration of the whole-person factors and \nsupporting evidence, my application of the pertinent factors under the adjudicative \nprocess, and my interpretation of my responsibilities under the adjudicative guidelines. \nFormal Findings \nThe formal findings on the allegations set forth in the SOR are as follows: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nAgainst Applicant \nFor Applicant \nAgainst Applicant \nFor Applicant \n Subparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.e: \n     Subparagraphs 1.f \u2013 1.m: \n Subparagraph 1.n: \n Subparagraphs 1.o \u2013 1.t: \nConclusion \nIn light of the record as a whole, it is not clearly consistent with the national \ninterest to grant Applicant\u2019s security clearance.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant, 57, is an information technology professional who has been employed by a federal contractor since 1988. He was initially granted access to classified information in 1989 and maintained access continuously until February 2017, when his security clearance was suspended. The suspension prompted the current adjudication. He completed a security clearance application in January 2018, disclosing information 3 about the dissolution of his marriage, which ended in divorce in 2017, and retaliatory actions against him by employees of another federal contracting company, all of whom he identified by name. He also disclosed potentially disqualifying information relating to his mental health, the suspension of his security clearance, illegal drug use, and three delinquent accounts. The ensuing investigation explored those issues and discovered issues with Applicant\u2019s federal and state income tax filings. (GE 1; TR1 at 47-48) Federal and State Taxes The SOR alleges Applicant, after receiving a filing extension, failed to timely file federal income tax returns for 2010 and 2012 through 2015 (SOR \u00b6 2.a), State 1 income tax returns for 2010 and 2015 (SOR \u00b6 2.c), and State 2 income tax returns for 2011- 2014 (SOR \u00b6 2.d). The SOR also alleges that he did not file federal income tax returns for the 2011 and the 2016 through 2018 (SOR \u00b6 2.b) tax years as well as State 2 state income tax returns for the 2016 through 2018 tax years.

The Agency acted under \nExecutive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry, \nsigned by President Eisenhower on February 20, 1960, as amended; as well as DOD \nDirective 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program, \ndated January 2, 1992, as amended (Directive), and the Adjudicative Guidelines for \nDetermining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information, implemented on June 8, \n2017. \nBased on the available information, DOD adjudicators were unable to find that it \nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant\u2019s security clearance and \nrecommended that the case be submitted to a Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals \n1 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(DOHA) administrative judge to determine whether to grant or deny his security \nclearance. \nApplicant timely answered the SOR and requested a hearing. Department \nCounsel sent Applicant the disclosure letter on January 14, 2021. The hearing was \ninitially scheduled for April 21, 2021. I issued a case management order (CMO), \ndetailing the Covid-19 safety protocols and the timeline for the submission of proposed \nexhibits, witness lists, SOR amendments, and pre-hearing motions on April 8, 2021. At \nthe request of the parties, I extended the filing deadlines and issued the Amended CMO \nthe same day. On April 12, 2021, Applicant requested a continuance, which I granted in \nthe interest of due process. I issued the Second Amended CMO on May 6, 2021. The \nhearing took place on June 15 and June 16, 2021. \nAt the hearing, I admitted to the record as Hearing Exhibits (HE): \nHE I - III(a): the three CMOs and related email correspondence; \nHE IV \u2013 VIII: all rulings on pre-hearing motions and related memoranda \nand email correspondence; \nHE IX \u2013 XII: administrative notice documents; and, \nHE XIII \u2013 XIV(a): other case-related administrative documents. \nI admitted, without objection, Government\u2019s Exhibits (GE) 1-5, 7, 9-22, and 24-29 \nand Applicant\u2019s Exhibits (AE) A-G and L-S. I admitted GE 6, 8, and 23 as well as AE H-\nK over the objections raised by the parties as explained below. After the hearing, \nApplicant submitted AE T-X, which are also admitted without objection. (HE XV) DOHA \nreceived the transcripts on June 28, and June 30, 2021. They are identified in the \nrecord as Transcript (TR) 1 and TR2, respectively. A Hearing Record Index is appended \nto the record as Appellate Exhibit I. (Ap. Ex.

Specifically, the Government moved to strike allegation \u00b6 1.a as \nwritten in the March 4, 2020 SOR and replace it with new language. Applicant did not \nobject to the change of language, and the I amended the SOR accordingly. Applicant \ndenied the substance of the amended allegation. (HE XIV \u2013 XIV(a)). \nPrehearing Motions \nOn April 26, 2021, Applicant filed a Motion for Additional Discovery, which \nDepartment Counsel opposed. I denied the motion, in part, and granted the motion, in \npart. I denied the request for additional discovery, ruling that the Government met its \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \nI \ndiscovery obligation under Directive, Additional Procedural Guidance \u00b6 E3.1.13. \ngranted Applicant\u2019s request that all emails exchanged by the parties be included in the \nrecord, and have done so as hearing exhibits. (HE V \u2013 V(b)) \nOn June 7, 2021, Applicant filed a motion in limine to exclude sexually explicit \nimages contained in GEs 6, 8, and 23. Applicant argued that the images were \nprejudicial, cumulative, and that their exclusion was necessary to prevent the \nvictimization of Applicant as well as the subject of the images. I denied the motion, \nruling that the images were relevant and material to issues alleged in the SOR. (HE VI \u2013 \nVI(c)) \nOn June 10, 2021, the parties filed a joint motion, seeking administrative notice \nof four documents from the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth \nEdition (DSMV-V). I granted the motion and admitted the documents as HE IX \u2013 XII. \n(HE VII \u2013 VII(b)). \nOn June 14, 2021, the Government filed an unopposed motion seeking \npermission to file additional evidence after the submission deadline established in the \nSecond Amended CMO. I granted the motion and admitted GE 17-29. (HE VIII \u2013 VIII(b)) \nEvidentiary Issues \nI resolved two evidentiary issues at the hearing. First, Sua sponte and without \nobjection from the parties, I redacted pages 71, 73, 74, and 75 of Exhibit M that \ncontained medical information about Applicant irrelevant to the issues raised in the \nSOR. (Tr. 66-68) \nSecond, Department Counsel objected to the admission of AE H-K, which related \nto a psychological evaluation procured by Applicant (AE H) and the qualifications of the \nlicensed clinical social worker (LCSW) who performed it. (AE I-K) Specifically, \nDepartment Counsel objected to the social worker\u2019s designation on her curriculum vitae \n(CV) as being \u201c[c]ertified by Department of Hearings and Appeals as a subject matter \nexpert.\u201d (AE J) The CV does not distinguish which agency conferred this designation. \nDOHA does not offer such a certification. Department Counsel also argued that the \nLCSW relied on a statement from a physician not in the adjudicative record; however, it \nappears that the reference is a misspelling of the physician\u2019s name, an immaterial \ntypographical error. I admitted the documents over Department Counsel\u2019s objection, \nwith the caveat that I would give appropriate weight and credibility to HE H-K in \nreaching a decision. (TR1 at 28-44.) \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant, 57, is an information technology professional who has been employed \nby a federal contractor since 1988. He was initially granted access to classified \ninformation in 1989 and maintained access continuously until February 2017, when his \nsecurity clearance was suspended. The suspension prompted the current adjudication. \nHe completed a security clearance application in January 2018, disclosing information \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nabout the dissolution of his marriage, which ended in divorce in 2017, and retaliatory \nactions against him by employees of another federal contracting company, all of whom \nhe identified by name. He also disclosed potentially disqualifying information relating to \nhis mental health, the suspension of his security clearance, illegal drug use, and three \ndelinquent accounts. The ensuing investigation explored those issues and discovered \nissues with Applicant\u2019s federal and state income tax filings. (GE 1; TR1 at 47-48) \nFederal and State Taxes \nThe SOR alleges Applicant, after receiving a filing extension, failed to timely file \nfederal income tax returns for 2010 and 2012 through 2015 (SOR \u00b6 2.a), State 1 income \ntax returns for 2010 and 2015 (SOR \u00b6 2.c), and State 2 income tax returns for 2011-\n2014 (SOR \u00b6 2.d). The SOR also alleges that he did not file federal income tax returns \nfor the 2011 and the 2016 through 2018 (SOR \u00b6 2.b) tax years as well as State 2 state \nincome tax returns for the 2016 through 2018 tax years.

He claims that his tax professional advised him that he had three years to file the \nincome tax returns and claim any refunds due to him. (TR1 at 51-52, 63) \nMarijuana Use \nThe SOR alleges that Applicant used marijuana with varying frequency between \n2010 and 2015 while holding a security clearance. In response to questions on his \nJanuary 2018 security clearance application, Applicant disclosed that he used \nmarijuana, \u201cmaybe 3 times total over the past seven years.\u201d He answered the follow-up \nquestion about illegal drug use while holding a security clearance affirmatively without \nadditional explanation. (GE 1, p. 0050) \nApplicant confirmed his three-time marijuana use in his August 2018 subject \ninterview, telling the investigator that he used the drug at parties with his friends. (GE 3, \np. 0092) He did not correct the statement when verifying the accuracy of the subject \ninterview summary in response to DOHA interrogatories.

(AE H, p. 43) At the \nhearing, he also stated he reported the drug use on a security clearance application he \ncompleted in 2016 in connection with a periodic reinvestigation. That security clearance \napplication is not in the record. (TR1 at 75). \nDuring his testimony, Applicant confirmed his knowledge that marijuana use was \nillegal under federal law and the prohibition against illegal drug use by clearance \nholders. (TR1 at 72-73) However, when questioned about his history of marijuana use, \nhe gave evasive answers. (TR1 at 63-65) During cross-examination by Department \nCounsel, Applicant could not confirm the number of times he used marijuana, explaining \nthat his disclosure on the security clearance application was his best guess and the \n\u201cworst case scenario.\u201d He explained that the actual times he used the drug could also \nbe zero. (TR 1 at 77-79, 108-109) When pressed on whether he used the drug while \nhaving a security clearance, Applicant responded, \u201cI tried marijuana during the time \nframe wherein I had a security clearance.\u201d (TR1 at 109-110) \nApplicant stated that he has no intent to use marijuana in the future and provided \na signed statement to that effect. He also stated that he no longer associates with \npeople who use the drug. (AE C; TR 1 at 64-66) He provided a drug screen report, \ndated April 2021, showing he did not test positive for any illegal drug. (AE M) \nMarital Issues \nAlthough the 2018 investigation identified potential tax issues and past marijuana \nuse, the investigation was prompted by the suspension of Applicant\u2019s clearance in \nFebruary 2017. The issues leading up to the suspension stem from his behavior during \nhis separation and eventual divorce. \nApplicant married in August 2014. Together, he and his wife (\u201cWife\u201d) engaged in \nan alternative sexual lifestyle. Around December 2014, Wife developed an interest in a \nparticular sexual community (\u201cCommunity\u201d). Together the couple participated in events \nand developed friendships with other members. Over time, Applicant realized that he \ndid not have the same interest in the Community\u2019s lifestyle as did Wife. Together they \nagreed that she would continue to participate with an agreed upon male partner \n(\u201cPartner\u201d), with whom the couple had developed a friendship. Although he decreased \nhis participation in the Community, Applicant leveraged his friendship with another \nmember (\u201cFriend\u201d) to help Wife obtain a position with a federal contracting company. In \nearly 2016, she began a position at Corporation A, reporting to Friend. Because Wife\u2019s \nposition required a security clearance, Applicant helped her complete the security \nclearance application. (GE3-6,8,17-18) \nWife\u2019s relationship with Partner intensified and began to interfere with the \nmarriage. Around May 2016, Applicant separately asked Wife and Partner to end their \nrelationship. Both refused and Wife decided to leave the marriage.

He \nclaims that Wife alerted Partner to the meeting and that Partner confronted him as he \nwaited outside. During the ensuing altercation between Applicant and Partner, Applicant \nclaims he lost his cell phone and several credit cards. He accuses Partner of stealing \nhis phone and Wife\u2019s cousin of stealing the credit cards. (GE 1, p. 0021-0022, GE 3, \n0087, GE17, pp. 0602-0604) \nLater that evening, a woman with whom Applicant worked at his client site, and a \nsecond woman, the chief operating officer of his employer (\u201cEmployer 1\u201d), received a \nseries of inappropriate messages from his cell phone number. He was terminated the \nnext day. Applicant denies sending the offensive messages, alleging that Partner sent \nthem from Applicant\u2019s stolen cell phone.

Although they worked for different federal \ncontracting companies, Applicant, Wife, and Friend supported the same federal \nprogram. (GE 4-6, 7, 12) \nApplicant\u2019s Breaking Point \nIn July 2016, Applicant learned that Wife planned to participate in a Community \nevent that he found objectionable and potentially illegal. He unsuccessfully attempted to \nhave the event canceled by reaching out to the event organizer as well as a family \nmember of the organizer. He also reached out to Friend. After the event, the Community \nposted pictures of Wife at the event in the private, members-only Community website, to \nwhich Applicant maintained his membership. Applicant described July 2016 event as his \nbreaking point. GE 4, GE 17, GE 25 \nBecause he helped Wife obtain a job with a federal contracting company and \nhelped her complete a security clearance application, Applicant believed he had a duty \nto report information that could raise a security risk to the proper authorities. (GE 3) \nBetween August 2016 and November 2017, he filed four adverse information reports \nwith the Personnel Security Management Office for Industry (PSMO-I). (GE 4-6,8) \nBecause he felt that the PSMO-I did not take appropriate action on the information he \nprovided, Applicant wrote letters of concern to the Office of Personnel Management (GE \n9), the Department of Labor \u2013 OSHA division as well as federal and state law \nenforcement agencies. According to a chart prepared by Applicant, he sent at least 17 \nletters to various government agencies and at least one national organization dedicated \nto the protection of sexually exploited individuals. (GE 14, 29) He also published a \nwebsite between December 2016 and June 2017. (GE 17-18) He stated that the \npurpose of the website was partially a method of dealing with his feelings, but also so \nthat Wife\u2019s family could see her activities.

He \ndescribed, from his point of view, her transformation from Christian college student to \nsuburban housewife to active participant in the Community. He wrote about the \ndissolution of their marriage and the role Partner, a former friend, played in the \ndeterioration of the marital relationship. He detailed Wife\u2019s sexual activities as well as \nher participation in the Community. He reported the illegal nature of her relationship with \nPartner, because they were both legally married to other people. He accused Wife of \nbeing an accessory to theft of his cell phone and credit cards. He alleged that her \nrefusal to participate in the criminal investigation of the theft was due to manipulation by \nPartner. He also named Friend, the nature of his position at Company A, and accused \nFriend of sabotaging Applicant\u2019s career to protect the Community. (GE 4-5,7) \nApplicant supplemented each letter and posted on his website photographic \nevidence of Wife\u2019s sexual activities that he downloaded from the Community private \nwebsite. The pictures showed Wife\u2019s full face and nude image. Applicant disseminated \npictures of Wife engaged in sex acts alone and with Partner, as well as pictures of her \nparticipating in sex acts at Community events. Applicant also disseminated and \npublished pictures of Partner and Friend, also identifying them by name, and detailing \ntheir involvement in the Community. He also attached to his letters and published on his \nwebsite screen shots of text messages, he believed substantiated his concerns about \nWife\u2019s behavior. \nApplicant stated that his use of Wife\u2019s sexually explicit images was reviewed by \nlocal law enforcement and Employer\u2019s 2 security office. He claims that neither raised \nany issues with his use of her image. He did not provide any evidence to corroborate \nthese statements. \nApplicant\u2019s Interaction with Company A \nOn multiple occasions between December 2016 and January 2017, Applicant \nreached out to Friend, Wife\u2019s supervisor, for assistance with the issues he believed \nwere created by her involvement in the Community and her relationship with Partner. In \nsoliciting Friend\u2019s help, Applicant revealed private information about Wife\u2019s background \nthat he admits she had only disclosed to him and one other trusted person, because he \nfelt Friend needed the information to fully appreciate the seriousness of the situation as \nhe saw it. Applicant also explained to Friend that he outed Partner as a member of the \nCommunity on his website because he believed it was necessary to protect Wife from \nPartner\u2019s manipulations. Friend, acting in his professional capacity, declined to engage \nwith Applicant about matters in his personal life.

(GE 26) \nApplicant\u2019s Termination from Employer 2 \nIn addition to information about Wife\u2019s sexual activities, Applicant shared \npersonal information on his website. In approximately February 2017, Applicant \npublished details of his job with Employer 2, and identified the federal program on which \nhe worked. He also named and posted a photograph of the Flag Officer (\u201cFlag Officer\u201d) \ndirecting the program. Applicant believes that Community members alerted Flag Officer \nto the website. (GE 17, p 0553) Upon learning of his identification on Applicant\u2019s \nwebsite, Flag Officer demanded both Applicant and Wife be removed from their jobs \nsupporting program. Employer 2 filed an incident report in JPAS, indicating that \nApplicant misused Employer 2 information technology systems by mentioning the \nprogram on his personal website. Applicant removed the reference from his website. \nApplicant stopped posting the website in June 2017, shortly after the divorce became \nfinal. However, the website remained accessible to the public until 2019, when he \ndeactivated it. (GE 1, 11-13) \nIn August 2017, Employer 2 began an investigation into Applicant\u2019s conduct, \nspecifically related to the information he disclosed on his website in February 2017. It is \nunclear why Employer 2 waited six months to being the investigation. In an effort to aid \nthe investigation, Applicant provided supplemental information to the Employer 2\u2019s \nsecurity department, again explaining the circumstances that he believed caused the \ndeterioration of his marriage and and how that spawned the autobiographical website. \nEmployer 2 suspended Applicant\u2019s clearance and ultimately terminated him in \nSeptember 2017. \nApplicant\u2019s Reports Retaliation by Company A and its Employees \nApplicant began to believe that his outing of Community members to \nGovernment agencies prompted Company A and Flag Officer to retaliate against him. \nApplicant wrote letters to military leadership (GE 11) and his Congressional \nrepresentatives expressing his concerns. (GE 13; see also GE 29) He filed ethics \ncomplaints with Employer 2. (GE 7) He filed complaints with the Inspector General\u2019s \n(IG) Office of two agencies. (GE 12, 15) Ultimately, he filed a lawsuit against the \nindividuals who he believed engaged in the retaliatory conduct. (GE 19-26, 29) \n  \nEmployer 2 Ethics Complaint \nIn August 2017, Applicant filed an ethics complaint with Employer 2. He asserted \nthat Friend, FSO-A, and Company A engaged in unethical behavior toward him in \nretaliation for outing members of the Community, to include Friend, Wife, and Partner. \nApplicant accused accused Friend and FSO-A of mishandling the derogatory \ninformation regarding Wife that he believed raised security concerns.

Applicant also alleged that Friend allowed Partner to \nmanipulate Wife in a way that did not reflect well on Company A. (GE 7) \nIn addition to the unethical behavior Applicant believes was directed at him, he \naccused Friend, a former Employer 2 employee, of engaging in unethical conduct \ntowards Employer 2. According to Applicant, when Friend transitioned from Employer 2 \nto Company A, he poached employees from Company 2. He also accused Company A \nof poor work performance as a subcontractor for Employer 2. There is no evidence that \nEmployer 2 took any action on this complaint. (GE 7) \n \nOther Complaints \nIn April 2018, Applicant wrote a letter to military leadership reporting his concerns \nabout the Community retaliating against him for outing members on his website. He \nnamed Friend in the letter and accused him of using his position with Company A and \nhis relationship with Flag Officer to manipulate the Flag Officer into taking adverse \naction against Applicant, which caused his termination from Employer 2. Applicant also \nexplained his belief that the Community manipulated Wife into engaging in potentially \nillegal sexual activity and ending their marriage. Ultimately, he asked the military \nleadership to investigate his claims and \u201cget answers\u201d from Flag Officer. Applicant \ninsinuated that by failing to investigate that the military leadership would be condoning \nthe exploitation of women by the Community. (GE 11) \nHe also wrote a letter to his U.S. Senator identifying himself as a whistleblower \nexperiencing professional retaliation by Flag Officer, acting under the influence of \nFriend, for reporting members of the federal contracting community involved in the \nsexual exploitation of women. He also accused military leadership of failing to \ninvestigate the allegations or take actions against the perpetrators, specifically Friend \nand Company A. Applicant asked the Senator to help him obtain information about his \nsuspended security clearance, to request that DSS to suspend the clearance of the \nindividuals he named in the letter, to interview the Flag Officer about his actions, and to \nrefer his case to the FBI. As an attachment to the letter, Applicant included a flash drive, \nincluding the correspondence he generated related to his allegations and a video clip of \nWife and Partner. (GE 13) \n \nInspector General (IG) Complaints \nIn May 2017, Applicant filed a complaint with the inspector general\u2019s (IG) office \nwith oversight of the military department responsible for the program Applicant \nsupported. According to Applicant, he did not receive a response to that complaint. He \nfiled a second complaint in April 2018. Describing himself as a whistleblower for outing \nCommunity members, including Friend and Wife, on his personal website and in \nadverse information reports to the PSMO-I. Applicant alleged that Friend, in his \nprofessional capacity at Company A, failed to alert FSO-A about wife\u2019s potentially illegal \nactivities in the Community. He also alleged that Company A and its employees, \nsabotaged his positions with Employers 1 and 2 in retaliation for outing Community \n10 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nmembers.

(GE 12) \nApplicant asked the IG to investigate the retaliatory actions of Company A and \nthe Flag Officer against him. He also asked the IG to investigate if Company A properly \nhired Wife for her position that he helped her secure, citing her lack of education and \nprofessional experience, as well as her involvement in the Community. He also \nrequested that the IG investigate whether Friend had an inappropriate relationship with \nWife, his subordinate. He did not receive a response to his complaint. (GE 12) \nIn May 2018, Applicant filed a complaint with the DOD IG. Applicant alleged that \nFlag Officer, acting under the influence of Company A employees, retaliated against him \nfor outing Community members associated with the federal program he managed to a \nmember of Congress, in reports to the relevant security agencies, and in three IG \ncomplaints. (GE 15) \nThe DOD IG responded to Applicant\u2019s complaint in November 2018, finding that \ninsufficient evidence existed to warrant an investigation of his reprisal complaint \nbecause the available evidence did not support a finding that a protected disclosure \ncould have been a factor in his dismissal from Employer 2. The DOD IG informed \nApplicant that the evidence, which included a clarification interview with him, \ninvestigation results from DSS, and information from Employer 2, suggested that his \ntermination was related to domestic matters and self-reported derogatory information \nthat constituted a security violation. In closing out the case, the DOD IG also informed \nApplicant that evidence showed that he was terminated from Employer 2 for violating \nthe company\u2019s acceptable information technology use policy and because the \nsuspension resulted in his inability to fulfill the duties of his position. Applicant \nresponded to the DOD IG\u2019s dismissal of his case, stating the agency received and acted \non false information given to the IG investigator. There is no evidence in the record to \nsuggest that the DOD IG responded to this allegation. (GE 27) \n  \nLawsuit \nIn March 2019, Applicant filed a civil lawsuit against Friend, FSO-A, and Flag \nOfficer in State 3 court, where Company A conducts business operations. Applicant \nalleged three causes of actions: tortious interference with a business relationship; \nintentional infliction of emotional distress; and, defamation of character. Flag Officer \nfiled a motion to have the case removed to federal court, where the charges against him \nwere dismissed for lack of jurisdiction. Friend and FSO-A also moved for dismissal of \nthe complaint. In his memorandum in opposition to their motion to dismiss, Applicant \nincluded the same sexually explicit photographs of Wife he published on his website \nand submitted to the multiple federal agencies. The court questioned the need for \nApplicant to submit such explicit material and admonished Applicant for not seeking \nleave to file the material under seal. The court sealed the images from public view \npending the resolution of the motion to dismiss. As of the hearing date, the lawsuit was \nstill ongoing.

The psychologist had Applicant \ncomplete a Personality Assessment Inventory (PAI) and interviewed Applicant in July \n2019. During the interview, Applicant discussed his personal background, his mental \nhealth history, his marriage and its deterioration as well as his professional history, \nincluding his terminations form Employers 1 and 2. He also discussed his use of illegal \ndrugs. In addition, the psychologist reviewed Applicant\u2019s 2018 background investigation, \nthe security clearance application, court records, and medical records from two other \nphysicians who have treated Applicant for Attention Deficient Hyperactivity Disorder \n(ADHD) and other medical conditions. (GE 2) \nThe psychologist noted the following opinion from the psychiatrist who treated \nApplicant for ADHD from 2009 to 2016: \n[The psychiatrist] reported that the subject experiences many relationship \nand financial issues that he does not handle responsibly and \u201ccreates \nmany of his own problems.\u201d [The psychiatrist] indicated that this subject \nhas the potential for reckless behavior. This provider noted that this \nsubject had a fair prognosis and identified ADHD as his diagnosis. (GE2, p \n0068) \nThe evaluating psychologist also noted that Applicant did not perceive much benefit \nfrom the treatment provided by his former psychiatrist. The treatment records from that \nphysician, which included the time Applicant met Wife and when their marriage began to \ndeteriorate, show that the Applicant was largely stable, but recommended therapy when \nhe began experiencing marital issues. The treatment records do not contain the \nprognosis cited by the evaluating psychologist. (GE 16) \nHowever, based on the interview with Applicant, the psychologist noted: \n[Applicant] has demonstrated poor judgment. This subject provided \ndetailed information regarding the sexual activities of his former spouse to \nmultiple agencies as well as the public by publishing a website in 2016. \nWhile this subject stated that he published the site to expose individuals \nwho harmed his spouse, he did not consider that his wife is a consenting \nadult and this information exposed private information that many would \nfind to be unnecessary and harmful. In fact, his judgment around \nmentioning the [federal program] on his website was impeached by his \ngovernment contacts at that time. [Applicant] has been fired twice in the \nlast three years. Both terminations were due at least in part to poor \ndiscretion on the part of [Applicant]. Further evidence of the subject\u2019s poor \njudgment is found in his report that he has used marijuana more than one \ntime in his home, while maintaining a security clearance; however, there is \nno evidence of a current substance use disorder from information \n12 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n[Applicant] presented during the clinical interview or indicated in available \nrecords.

The \npsychologist also opined that Applicant\u2019s poor judgment is directly related to the \nemotional distress he experienced during the dissolution of his marriage and divorce. \nUltimately the psychologist concluded that, \u201cin the future, it is questionable whether this \nindividual\u2019s emotional distress will continue to impair his judgment as it has done in the \nrelatively recent past.\u201d (GE 2, 0074) \n2021 Psychological Evaluation \nApplicant procured his own psychological evaluation from a licensed clinical \nsocial worker in April 2021.

(AE X) \nI note and specifically find that DOD DOHA does not offer such a certification. \nFurthermore, there is nothing in the record to support her assertion that she is \nrecognized by the Government as a qualified mental health professional. \n13 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nIn reaching her conclusions, the LCSW relied on an interview with Applicant, the \nSOR and Applicant\u2019s answer, the OPM investigative report, the 2019 psychological \nevaluation ordered by DOD, a May 2020 statement from Applicant\u2019s current treating \nphysician, and a statement from Applicant\u2019s former treating physician. (AE I) The LCSW \nanalyzed his behavior under the adjudicative guidelines, reaching the following \nconclusions: \n \n \n \n \nSubstance Abuse and Misuse \nWhile the LCSW acknowledged that Applicant used marijuana three times \nbetween 2010 and 2015, the LCSW opines that is highly unlikely to ever occur again \nbecause the personal and professional consequences were very significant. The LCSW \nalso noted that Applicant does not continue to associate with any individuals who use \nillegal drugs, that he avoids environments where drugs are used, and his signed notice \nof intent to abstain from future drug use. (AE H, pp 44-45) \n \nPsychological Conditions \nThe LCSW determined that Applicant has never engaged in irresponsible, \nviolent, self-harming, chronic lying, suicidal, deceitful, or exploitative behavior. The \nLCSW noted that Applicant\u2019s behavior should be taken into context as that of someone \nwho was trying to vindicate himself, save his marriage, and bring illegal activities to the \nattention of authorities \u2013 a series of events unlikely to recur. Opining that Applicant had \nreceived varying opinions from \u201cfair\u201d outcome to \u201cpositive\u201d prognosis, the LCSW \nconcluded that Applicant has a more positive prognosis for the future. The LCSW also \nconcluded, without identifying a specific condition, that the condition is under control, in \nremission, and with continued support, there is a low probability of recurrence of similar \nbehavior. Ultimately, the LCSW found that the emotions and mental conditions caused \nby the dissolution of his marriage are will behind Applicant and that he has moved on \nwith his life and has no intention of dwelling on the past. (AE H, pp 45-48) \n \nPersonal Conduct \nThe LCSW determined that Applicant did not engage in any activity considered \ndisqualifying under the personal conduct guideline; specifically, that he had not engaged \nin any behavior considered disruptive or violent, or that he engaged in any inappropriate \nbehavior or activities that could affect his personal or community standing as described \nin the adjudicative guidelines. The LCSW indicated that Applicant had not engaged in \nany pattern of dishonesty, but \u201cerred on the side of caution\u201d by being fully transparent \nabout his life. He misunderstood the rules of filing income taxes. The LCSW did not \nmake any other findings regarding the financial considerations concerns alleged in the \nSOR. Ultimately, the LCSW concluded that Applicant did not engage in any offenses \nthat would cast doubt on his reliability to hold a security clearance and protect the \nnational interests of the United States of America.

The test \noffered a propensity for obsessive compulsive disorders which the LCSW felt was in line \nwith Applicant\u2019s ADHD diagnosis. The testing revealed no substance use disorder and \nthat Applicant had no probability of an adverse emotional, mental, or personality \ncondition that could impair judgment, reliability, or trustworthiness. The LCSW made the \nfollowing diagnoses: \nF10.929 \nNo Use Disorder, with no treatment required; and \nZ71.1 \nDeferred Diagnosis, with continued treatment for ADHD, \nmajor depressive disorder, and generalized anxiety disorder. \nBased on all of the information the LCSW reviewed, she determined that \nApplicant is not at risk of relapse or return to his previous behavior. (AE H, pp 52-54) \nCurrent Medical Treatment \nApplicant has been seeing his current psychiatrist since December 2016 for the \ntreatment of ADHD, major depressive disorder, and generalized anxiety disorder. The \ntreatment only includes medication management. He is not currently in therapy. \nAccording to the psychiatrist, Applicant has responded well to his pharmacological \ntreatment and has been stable throughout the treatment. The psychiatrist, noting \nApplicant\u2019s history of working on projects that requires a security clearance, believes \nthat if Applicant\u2019s clearance is reinstated that he would continue to be successful. The \nnote does not mention if the psychiatrist is familiar with the incidents and conduct \nleading up to Applicant\u2019s security clearance suspension. (AE A) \nDOHA Interrogatory Responses \nIn January 2020, Applicant provided a 104-page response to a set of DOHA \ninterrogatories. A series of questions sought information about his use of information \ntechnology, specifically asking if he accessed Wife\u2019s phone, social media accounts, and \nemails accounts without her permission. Applicant admitted that while he had access to \nher phone during their marriage, he did not have Wife\u2019s permission to copy any data \nfrom it. Applicant also admitted that he continued to use the password spreadsheet Wife \ncreated in 2015 that contained her login and password information for her social medial \nand email accounts after she left the marriage in May 2016 through at least June or \nJuly. He believed that because he was still her husband, he had the ability to use the \ninformation. When Wife changed her passwords, Applicant assumed that she no longer \nwanted him to have access to her accounts. He felt his actions were necessary to \nprotect Wife from what he viewed as the dangerous influence of Partner.

(GE 3, pp 0100-0101) \nCharacter Letters \nApplicant did not present any witness testimony, but provided two character \nletters in support of his application. Each described him as a well-liked. The character of \nthe letter from a work colleagues described Applicant as behavior at work as being \nvalued for his technical expertise and the quality of the support he provides their client. \nThe co-worker acknowledged that Applicant told him about the problems with his wife \nand his belief that the loss of his clearance was based on an unjustified attack on his \ncharacter. The co-worker indicated that Applicant behaved like a competent, \ntrustworthy, and responsible individual. The co-worker would recommend Applicant for \naccess to classified information. (AE E) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \n16 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nThe SOR alleges disqualifying conduct under the financial considerations, drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse, psychological guidelines, and personal conduct \nguidelines. The Government has established a prima facie case under each. \nFinancial Considerations \nThe SOR alleges that Applicant, after filing for extensions of time to file, failed to \ntimely file his federal and state income tax returns from 2010 to at least 2018. The \nrecord establishes that Applicant filed each of the federal income tax returns at issue \nbetween 1 and 3 years after the filing deadline. Failure to meet financial obligations may \nindicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and \nregulations all of which can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and ability to protect classified or sensitive information. His conduct \ninvokes the following financial considerations disqualifying conditions: \nAG \u00b6 19(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local \nincome tax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired. \nThe following financial considerations mitigating condition partially applies: \nAG \u00b6 20(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax \nauthority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with that arrangement. \nApplicant has filed the federal income tax returns for 2010 through 2015, and \n2017 through 2018. He did not provide sufficient evidence to support a finding that he \nfiled the 2016 federal income tax return. Applicant has also established that he filed the \n2010 and 2015 income tax returns with State 1, and the 2011 through 2014 income tax \nreturns with State 2. Those returns were filed within 1 to 3 years after the year in which \nthey were due.

The reasons for his failure to timely file are also relevant. \nApplicant held a security clearance for 22 years before he began an eight-year streak of \nfailing to timely file his federal and state income taxes. The explanation he offered at \nhearing does not mitigate the concern. It is unlikely that a tax professional advised \nApplicant that receiving a refund changed his filing obligations under state and federal \nlaw. Ultimately, Applicant failed to provide sufficient explanation to mitigate the concerns \nregarding his failure to timely file his federal and state income tax returns after receiving \nextensions of time to do so. \nDrug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nThe illegal use of controlled substances . . . that cause physical or mental \nimpairment . . . raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both \nbecause such behavior may lead to physical or psychological impairment and because \nit raises questions about a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, and \nregulations. (See AG \u00b6 24). Applicant disclosed on his January 2018 security clearance \napplication that he used marijuana three times between 2010 and 2015, while having a \nsecurity clearance. Applicant confirmed his usage in his August 2018 subject interview, \na 2019 clinical interview, and a 2021 clinical interview. At the hearing he admitted he \naware of the illegality of marijuana use under federal law and the prohibition against \nillegal drug use by cleared individuals. \nApplicant\u2019s conduct requires the application of the following disqualifying \nconditions: \nAG \u00b6 25(a) Any substance misuse; and \nAG \u00b6 25(f) Any illegal drug use while granted access to classified \ninformation or holding a sensitive position. \nThe following mitigating conditions partially apply: \nAG \u00b6 26(a) The behavior happened so long ago, was infrequent, or \nhappened under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not \ncast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \nAG \u00b6 26(b) the individual acknowledges his drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this \nproblems, and has established pattern of abstinence, including but not \nlimited to: \n18 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(1) Dissociation from drug-using association and contacts; \n(2) Changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; and \n(3) Providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that any future \ninvolvement or misuse is grounds for revocation of national security \neligibility. \nWhile the above mitigating conditions partially apply, the security concern is not \nmitigated. Although Applicant\u2019s drug use is not recent and he provided a signed \nstatement of intent to abstain from future use, his promise to abstain lacks credibility. \nApplicant\u2019s drug use was purely recreational and did not occur under circumstances \nunlikely to recur. During the investigation, Applicant provided conflicting information \nabout the circumstances of his marijuana use. At the hearing, he gave evasive \ntestimony about his drug use, attempting to assign different meaning to the disclosure \nhe made on his 2018 security clearance application. \nPsychological Conditions \nAn applicant\u2019s mental health becomes a concern when \u201c[c]ertain emotional, \nmental, and personality conditions can impair judgement, reliability, or trustworthiness. \nA formal diagnosis is not required for there to be a concern under this guideline. (AG \u00b6 \n27) \nThe SOR alleges that the physician who treated Applicant between 2009 and \n2016 for ADHD gave him a fair prognosis, noting that he could engage in irresponsible \nand reckless behavior in the future. While the prognosis seemed prescient, the \nprognosis without context is not helpful because the circumstances and events \nprompting the prognosis are unknown. It is unclear when the physician made the \nprognosis and what behaviors he observed to make that finding. Furthermore, Applicant \nhas been under continuous treatment for ADHD since 2009. A letter from his current \nphysician, who has treated Applicant since 2016, believes that Applicant is stable. The \npsychologist who performed the 2019 DOD-ordered evaluation opined that ADHD was \nnot the cause of Applicant\u2019s behavior. Based on the available information, this allegation \nis resolved in Applicant\u2019s favor. \nHowever, Applicant\u2019s behavior does warrant consideration under this guideline \nabsent any particular diagnosis. Between May 2016 and June 2017, Applicant shared \ndetails of his then estranged Wife\u2019s private and consensual sexual activities and her \nromantic relationship with her new partner with numerous government agencies and on \nthe internet. He also disseminated sexually explicit photographs of her to third parties \nand published them online. He also accused another federal contracting employee and \na flag officer of retaliation for publicly outing individuals involved in an alternative sexual \nlifestyle community. The record contains a sample of these writings, consisting of more \nthan 300 pages. In the 2019 psychological evaluation, the psychologist attributes \nApplicant\u2019s behavior to the emotional distress he experienced after his Wife left the \n19 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nmarriage. The poor judgment and lack of discretion Applicant demonstrated was not the \nresult of any particular mental health condition. \nBased on the evidence, the following psychological conditions disqualifying \nconditions apply: \nAG \u00b6 28(a) behavior that casts doubt on an individual\u2019s judgment, stability, \nreliability, or trustworthiness, not covered under any other guideline and \nthat may indicate an emotional, mental, or personality condition, including, \nbut not limited to irresponsible, violent, self-harm, suicidal, paranoid, \nmanipulative, impulsive, chronic lying, deceitful, exploitative, or bizarre \nbehavior.  \nIn response to the DOD-ordered 2019 evaluation, Applicant procured an \nevaluation from a LCSW in April 2021. This evaluation does not offer any information or \ninsight that explains, refutes, or mitigates Applicant\u2019s behavior. In terms of evaluating \nthe underlying conduct, the LCSW attributes Applicant\u2019s actions to altruistic motives: \nsaving his ex-wife, vindicating himself, and alerting authorities to potentially illegal \nbehavior, therefore seeming to justify his conduct. The evaluation does not critically \nexamine Applicant\u2019s conduct, but rather reinforces his narrative that he is the aggrieved \nparty. \nWhile Applicant may have been emotionally devastated by the ending of his \nmarriage \u2013 he was also angry. His anger caused him to behave inappropriately and \nobsessively. He is not a victim. He is not whistleblower. In his anger he chose to \nvictimize the people he believed caused him harm. However, in his efforts to do so, his \nbehavior raised serious doubts about his emotional and mental stability. Over the \ncourse of 14 months, Applicant engaged in behavior that was contrary to his self-\ninterest and professional preservation. He alone is responsible for the consequences \nthat have befallen him as a result of his efforts to expose his ex-wife and those \nassociated with her. \nThe record does not contain any information to mitigate the concerns raised by \nApplicant\u2019s behavior. At the hearing, it became clear that Applicant does not see the \nissue with his behavior. As such, he has not spent any time examining his motivations \nor the security implications of his actions. Because he has failed to do so, he has not \nsought counseling to develop a better understanding about his behavior or develop \nbetter coping mechanisms when faced with emotional distress. Accordingly, Applicant \nremains at risk of behaving similarly in the future when he finds himself unjustly \naggrieved or in emotional distress. None of the psychological mitigating conditions \napply.  \nPersonal Conduct \nAn individual\u2019s personal conduct raises concerns about their reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and ability to protect classified information when it involves \nquestionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonest, or unwillingness to comply with rules \n20 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nand regulations. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful and candid answers \nduring national security investigative or adjudicative process. (AG \u00b6 15) \nThe SOR alleges that Applicant falsified his security clearance application by \nfailing to disclose his failure to timely file his federal and state income tax returns \nbetween 2010 and 2018. A finding of falsification requires a finding that Applicant acted \nwith intent to deceive the Government. Here, no such intent exists. Applicant\u2019s failure to \ndisclose this information is consistent with his testimony that he had three years to file \nthe outstanding returns. This allegation is resolved in Applicant\u2019s favor. \nThe Government cross-alleges under the personal conduct guideline, Applicant\u2019s \nmarijuana use while having a security clearance and his conduct after the dissolution of \nhis marriage. Both issues are independently disqualifying under the relevant guidelines, \nas discussed above. However, Applicant\u2019s conduct highlights the concerns identified in \nAG \u00b6 15, casting doubt about his ability to protect classified information. \nWhole Person Concept   \nBased on the record, I have significant reservations about Applicant\u2019s current \nsecurity worthiness. In reaching this conclusion, I have also considered the whole-\nperson factors at AG \u00b6 2(d). When considered together, Applicant\u2019s conduct supports a \nnegative whole-person assessment. In trying to expose his wife, Applicant \ndemonstrated a lack of judgment and poor discretion. His motivations were not altruistic. \nHe did not act out of concern for his wife. He is not a whistleblower, seeking to expose \nfraud, waste, or abuse of government resources. His actions were punitive, exploitive, \nand vengeful \u2013 an attempt to embarrass and hurt his ex-wife and those associated with \nher. \nApplicant shared private information indiscriminately and publicly without regard \nfor the potential security implications raised by his actions. What the LCSW hailed as a \ndisplay of transparency, actually revealed Applicant\u2019s inability to recognize personal and \nprofessional boundaries as well as a profound lack of discretion. In his anger and \nemotional distress, Applicant abandoned this principle to such an extent that he cast \ndoubt on his ongoing security worthiness. He showed disrespect for the personal \nprivacy of others, invading it whenever he felt justified. He handled his own private \ninformation and that of others with such reckless disregard that he raised serious \nconcerns that he would handle and safeguard classified information in the same \nmanner. This negative whole-person assessment is not mitigated by his years of having \naccess to classified information without incident, or the favorable character information \nin the record. Applicant\u2019s actions demonstrated that he lacks the good judgment, \nreliability, and trustworthiness required of those granted access to classified information. \n21 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Psychological Conditions \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.b: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph1.c: \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 2, Financial Considerations \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 2.a \u2013 2.e: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 3, Drug Involvement and Substance  \nMisuse \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 3.a: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 4, Personal Conduct \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 4.a:  \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 4.b \u2013 4.c: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented in this case, it is not clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant Applicant\u2019s security clearance.

On February \n4, 2020, the Defense Counterintelligence and Security Agency Consolidated \nAdjudications Facility (CAF) issued Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing \nsecurity concerns under Guidelines F (Financial Considerations), and E (Personal \nConduct). The action was taken under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DoD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the Security Executive Agent Directive (SEAD) 4 \nNational Security Adjudicative Guidelines (AG), which came into effect on June 8, 2017. \n1 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant submitted his written Answer to the SOR on March 23, 2020.

The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) assigned \nthe case to me on December 28, 2020. The scheduling of the hearing was delayed for a \nsignificant amount of time due to communication technology limitations and travel \nrestrictions based on the COVID-19 pandemic. DOHA issued a Notice of Microsoft Teams \nVideo Teleconference Hearing on March 11, 2022, setting the hearing for March 29, 2022. \nOn that date, Department Counsel offered Government Exhibits (GE) 1 through 7 into \nevidence. Applicant testified, and offered Applicant Exhibits (AE) A through E into \nevidence. All exhibits were admitted without objection. DOHA received the hearing \ntranscript (Tr.) on April 13, 2022. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant is 53 years old. He is married for the second time. He has one adult child \nfrom his first marriage and two adult stepchildren. He earned a high school diploma in \n1987. He began his current employment with a major aerospace company in June 2009, \nhaving previously worked there from 1996 to 2002. He is applying for his first national \nsecurity eligibility so he can support his employer\u2019s ongoing and prospective DoD \ncontracts. He never served in the military or held a Federal civil service position. (GE 1; \nGE 2; Tr. 8-9, 34-35, 46-47.) \nAs alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.b, Applicant and his first wife filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy \nrelief during October 1997. The bankruptcy court discharged their eligible debts in \nFebruary 1998. Applicant testified that their marriage was contentious and he \u201cwas not \nresponsible with [his] money at all back then.\u201d (GE 3; Tr. 36.) \nApplicant\u2019s divorce from his first wife was finalized in May 2004 and he married his \ncurrent wife in July 2005. They encountered no financial difficulties during their first eight \nyears of marriage, and purchased their first home in February 2012. In 2013 Applicant \nsuffered some significant medical issues, causing him to miss several months of work. \nHe also incurred increasing expenses of three teenage sons\u2019 involvement in sports, and \nhad reduced overtime availability at work when he returned. He and his wife borrowed  \nfunds to try to remain solvent, but eventually fell behind on some debts including a four-\nor-five-month delinquency on their home mortgage. Their lender filed a foreclosure action \nat that point. They wanted to protect their home, in which they had already accrued \nsubstantial equity, and sought legal advice. Their attorney advised and assisted them to \nfile for Chapter 13 bankruptcy protection, which they did in April 2014 as alleged in SOR \n\u00b6 1.b. (GE 1; GE 2; GE 3; Tr. 28-30, 37-40, 52-53.) \nApplicant\u2019s medical troubles continued and he suffered a six-month period in which \nhe could not work, causing problems with fully making the initial court-ordered monthly \nbankruptcy payments, of which he kept his attorney apprised. The attorney apparently \nfiled a request to lower those payments to an affordable level. During the same period, \nhis father-in-law suffered a debilitating disease. The family decided that Applicant\u2019s in-\nlaws would sell their home in another state and move in with Applicant and his wife so \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nthat her father could continue to be cared for at home. This arrangement generated \nsignificant funds that were contributed to Applicant and his wife to repay or bring current \nall of the debts involved in their bankruptcy. They then petitioned to have the bankruptcy \ndismissed by the court in January 2017, and began resolving each underlying debt with \nthe respective creditor in a methodical and reasonable manner. (GE 1; GE 2; Tr. 28-30, \n37-40, 52-53.) \nThe SOR also alleged five specific delinquent consumer debts, totaling $4,152.00, \nthat remained on Applicant\u2019s credit reports in early 2020. These accounts were opened \nbetween 2010 and 2014 and were among the last of the bankruptcy debts resolved by \nApplicant and his wife, who is the primary manager of their finances. The largest of these \ndebts (SOR \u00b6 1.c) was a secured $3,183.00 loan for a vacuum cleaner that she \npurchased. This debt was fully repaid in August 2019. The other four debts (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d-\n1.g), totaling $969.00, were also repaid in full between mid-2017 and early-2020. (GE 2, \nGEs 4-7; AE A; Tr. 40-42.) \nDuring 2012 and 2013, while Applicant was struggling financially, he had too little \nFederal income tax withheld from his paychecks and bonuses, and incurred some \nadditional tax liability for IRA withdrawals. As a result, he incurred $14,584.00 in \ndelinquent tax debt, as alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.h. He filed proper returns documenting these \nshortfalls and made contemporaneous arrangements with the IRS to increase his \nwithholdings, pay $300 per month, and forfeit subsequent refunds to repay this debt. After \nthree or four years of compliance with this agreement, he completed full repayment of this \ndebt. He has not experienced any other income tax issues. (GE 1; GE 2; AE B; Tr. 22, \n27, 34, 44-46.) \nSOR \u00b6 1.i alleges a former $3,156.00 child support arrearage owed to Applicant\u2019s \nstate\u2019s Department of Social and Health Services. After the separation preceding their \n2004 divorce, Applicant\u2019s then-four-year-old son lived with him but his former wife \nprovided no child support. During his senior year of high school, that son declared that he \nwould no longer follow Applicant\u2019s rules and was going to go live with his mother so he \ncould just party and play video games. The arrangement among them provided that \nApplicant would pay no child support to his former wife, but she was on welfare and \nclaimed their son as a dependent to increase her monthly payments. The state paid her \nthe equivalent of child support payments and charged Applicant for them because he was \na solvent parent. This continued until the son graduated from high school at age 19, but \nApplicant was not notified of the debt until he had accumulated the alleged arrearage. He \nmade regular payments to the state for a couple of years until he had paid all support \nclaimed by the state. Due to a clerical error, the state failed to report this fact to the credit \nbureaus so the debt remained on the credit report. Applicant provided a letter from the \nstate agency documenting his completion of payments in July 2014 as an attachment to \nhis Answer. (Tr. 15-17, 25, 46-48.) \nApplicant\u2019s current financial situation is good.

(GE \n6; GE 7; Tr. 30-34, 39-40, 43-44, 53-54.)   \nSOR \u00b6 2.a alleges that Applicant falsified material facts in his March 2018 e-QIP \nresponse to the Section 26 bankruptcy question by disclosing his Chapter 13 filing but \nsaying that it was dismissed at his request because he \u201chad the money to catch up the \nhouse up to current and payoff [sic] the cars involved.\u201d This was generally consistent with \nwhat Applicant told the investigator during his April 2019 OPM enhanced subject \ninterview. The SOR alleges that the statement was false because it differed from his \n\u201crepresentation to the Bankruptcy Court on December 2014, 2016, when [he] moved to \ndismiss the case because he could \u2018no longer afford to make [his] Chapter 13 Plan \nPayments.\u201d On that date, Applicant\u2019s attorney filed a motion seeking voluntary dismissal \nof the case that stated, \u201c[Applicant\u2019s] overtime hours have been decreased and is [sic] \nsuffering from an unexpected illness and they can no longer make their Chapter 13 Plan \nPayments.\u201d On January 10, 2017, the bankruptcy judge granted Applicant\u2019s motion to \nvoluntarily dismiss the Chapter 13 case, \u201cfor Other Cause.\u201d (GE 2.) \nApplicant agreed that he had been encountering difficulties making the full \npayments, and so advised his attorney, before his in-laws moved in to live with them and \ndonated funds to him and his wife for use resolving their Chapter 13 debts. He neither \nsigned, nor was aware of, the specifics of his attorney\u2019s December 2016 formal motion to \ndismiss the case. He testified that both reasons played into their determination to use the \navailable funds to resolve the debts rather than continuing to make payments under court \nsupervision, despite the fact that he would lose the benefit of paying a significantly \nreduced total amount to resolve the debts through bankruptcy. When they obtained the \nresources to meet their obligations to fully repay their creditors, they decided to honorably \ndo so. I find no evidence that Applicant attempted to conceal any of these material facts, \nwhich he has freely disclosed and discussed throughout this process. (GE 1; GE 2; GE \n3; Tr. 29-30, 32, 48-51, 58-60.) \nAfter increasing the Federal income tax withholdings from his paycheck, as \ndiscussed above with respect to SOR \u00b6 1.h, Applicant and his wife received refunds from \nthe IRS for tax years 2014 and 2015. Their then-active Chapter 13 bankruptcy plan called \nfor them to turn over any refunds in excess of $1,500 to the trustee for use in making plan \npayments. Their attorney did not make them aware of this requirement until the \nbankruptcy trustee received notice of the refunds and petitioned the court to recover the \nfunds. On November 18, 2016, the court entered an order implementing an agreement \nbetween the trustee and Applicant\u2019s attorney to increase their monthly plan payments in \norder to account for the refund recoupment. This situation was not an irresponsible or \nsurreptitious attempt to unlawfully retain the income tax refunds, but rather a \nmisunderstanding that was promptly resolved through a court-sanctioned mutual \nagreement.

(AE B; AE C; AE D.) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility, the administrative judge \nmust consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief introductory \nexplanations, each guideline lists potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of \nhuman behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in AG \n\u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. \nThe administrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6\u00b6 2(b) and 2(c), the entire process is a \nconscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the whole-person concept. The \nadministrative judge must consider all available, pertinent, and reliable information about \nthe person, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that any doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility be resolved in favor of the national security. In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. \nAccording to Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to \nestablish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 states, \u201cThe applicant \nis responsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d \nA person who applies for national security eligibility seeks to enter into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants eligibility \nfor access to classified information or assignment in sensitive duties. Decisions include, \nby necessity, consideration of the possible risk the applicant may deliberately or \ninadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified or sensitive information. Such \ndecisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather \nthan actual, risk of compromise of protected information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides, \u201cAny determination under this order adverse to \nan applicant shall be a determination in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense \nbe a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n     \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAnalysis \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nThe security concerns relating to the guideline for financial considerations are set \nout in AG \u00b6 18, which reads in pertinent part:  \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personal security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAG \u00b6 19 describes two conditions that could raise security concerns and may be \ndisqualifying in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant and his first wife received bankruptcy relief under Chapter 7 in February \n1998. When he and his second wife encountered financial hardships in 2012 and 2013 \nthat they could not resolve, they consulted an attorney and were advised to file for Chapter \n13 supervision of a court-approved repayment plan. They followed this plan from 2014 \nuntil January 2017, when their bankruptcy was dismissed at their request because they \nhad obtained the means to repay their creditors. A few relatively minor debts that were \nstill pending when Applicant filed his e-QIP had been resolved by the time the SOR was \nissued. Nevertheless, these facts establish prima facie support for the foregoing \ndisqualifying conditions, and shift the burden to Applicant to mitigate the resulting security \nconcerns. \nThe guideline includes four conditions in AG \u00b6 20 that could mitigate the security \nconcerns arising from Applicant\u2019s admitted financial difficulties: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; and \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.  \nApplicant\u2019s two temporary periods of delinquent debt over the past twenty-five \nyears were caused by employment and medical conditions beyond his control and each \nwas responsibly addressed through appropriate bankruptcy proceedings undertaken on \nadvice of his legal counsel. In early 1998 his debts were fully discharged under Chapter \n7. More than 16 years later, he and his second wife filed for protection under a court-\napproved Chapter 13 plan, which they followed until late 2016 when their changed family \nsituation generated sufficient resources for them to voluntarily dismiss that plan and fully \nresolve the debts involved. That process took several years but was fully completed by \nthe time Applicant\u2019s SOR was issued. This responsible conduct under unique \ncircumstances eliminates the prima facie concerns about his reliability, trustworthiness, \nand judgment. He offered substantial evidence to establish that such problems are not \nongoing, and are unlikely recur. Applicant sufficiently established mitigation of the \nformerly valid concerns under AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a) and 20(b).  \nApplicant obtained financial counseling from his bankruptcy attorneys both times \nhe encountered issues he could not resolve on his own, and established his family\u2019s \nsolvency to meet financial obligations going forward. He demonstrated that these issues, \nin aggregate, have been brought under control, through good-faith efforts that led to \nresolution of all of his formerly delinquent accounts. Accordingly, he established additional \nmitigation of the security concerns under the provisions of AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(c) and 20(d). \nGuideline E: Personal Conduct \nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the security concerns pertaining to personal conduct: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during the national \nsecurity investigative or adjudicative processes.  \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 16 describes two conditions that could raise security concerns and may be \ndisqualifying under the facts alleged in the SOR: \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar \nform used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, \naward benefits or status, determine national security eligibility or \ntrustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities; and \n(d) credible adverse information that is not explicitly covered under any \nother guideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an adverse \ndetermination, but which, when combined with all available information, \nsupports a whole-person assessment of questionable judgment, \nuntrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with \nrules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that the individual \nmay not properly safeguard classified or sensitive information. \nThe SOR alleged that Applicant intentionally falsified facts in his e-QIP about the \nreason for seeking the voluntary dismissal of his Chapter 13 plan, which the court-granted \nin January 2017. I find this allegation to be unsubstantiated and, in fact, contradicted by \ncompelling evidence. While he disclosed the most compelling and final reason he and his \nwife decided to forego bankruptcy relief and fully repay all of the involved creditors, his \nattorney\u2019s court filing only cited a subordinate, but apparently sufficient (if not boilerplate) \njustification for the motion. I am convinced that Applicant was unaware of this discrepancy \nand had no intention to conceal or deceive the Government about the facts surrounding \nthis bankruptcy. Accordingly, possible disqualifying concerns under AG \u00b6 16(a) were not \nestablished. \nSimilarly, potentially disqualifying concerns under AG \u00b6 16(d) relating to \nApplicant\u2019s 2014 and 2015 income tax refunds were dispelled by the record evidence. \nLegal procedures were followed by the bankruptcy trustee and Applicant\u2019s attorney to \nbring these refunds to the court\u2019s attention and reach an agreement to incorporate their \npayment into the plan once the issue came to their attention. Applicant was unaware of \nthe provision requiring payment of refunds exceeding $1,500 into the plan until this arose, \nand agreed to the mutually negotiated resolution. These facts are not probative of any \nquestionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to \ncomply with rules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that Applicant may \nnot properly safeguard classified or sensitive information. \nSince the record evidence does not establish or support potentially disqualifying \nsecurity concerns under this guideline, no discussion of potential mitigating conditions \nunder AG \u00b6 17 is warranted, beyond those concepts addressed in the following whole-\nperson analysis. \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s national security eligibility by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct \nand all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nAccording to AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant national security \neligibility must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the applicable guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \npertinent facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant is a mature adult, who \nfully disclosed and consistently demonstrated accountability for his two unrelated periods \nof financial hardship over the past 25 years. He convincingly demonstrated his intention \nto remain financially stable after responsibly resolving the problems generated by his \nunavoidable medical and related employment issues around ten years ago. \nThis is not a matter of substituting a credibility assessment for the facts of this \ncase. Applicant has been honest and forthright throughout this process, which is \nimportant to establishing and maintaining national security eligibility. That integrity fortifies \nother strong evidence of his trustworthiness, responsibility, and willingness to comply with \nrules and regulations. \nThe potential for pressure, exploitation, or duress is minimal since Applicant has \ninformed his supervisors, family, and friends about his previous financial issues and \nsatisfactorily resolved them. Recurrence of delinquent indebtedness is not likely. \nOverall, the evidence has eliminated any doubt as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and \nsuitability for a security clearance. He successfully met his burden to disprove or mitigate \nsecurity concerns arising under the Financial Considerations and Personal Conduct \nguidelines. \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                      \n     \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a through 1.i: \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline E: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 2.a and 2.b: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly \nconsistent with the interests of national security to grant Applicant a security clearance. \nNational security eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \nDAVID M.

As of the date of the hearing, she worked as a compliance coordinator and an assistant facility security officer for her employer, a DOD contractor, since approximately March 2015. She was first granted a security clearance in approximately May 2018. (Answer; Tr. at 5, 18-23, 36-38, 73-74; GE 1, 2; AE D) The SOR alleged that Applicant had two delinquent consumer accounts totaling approximately $4,749 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a - 1.b), a $335 delinquent medical account (SOR \u00b6 1.c), and nine delinquent student loans totaling $56,269 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d - 1.l).

She graduated from high school in 2003 and \nattended college from 2003 to 2010 but did not earn a degree. (Answer; Tr. at 17-18, 35-\n38, 74; GE 1, 2) \nApplicant was unemployed from January 2006 to August 2008, and from \nSeptember to December 2011. From approximately December 2011 to February 2015, \nshe worked as a temporary employee, through a staffing agency, for the same company \nthat she worked for as of the date of the hearing. As of the date of the hearing, she worked \nas a compliance coordinator and an assistant facility security officer for her employer, a \nDOD contractor, since approximately March 2015. She was first granted a security \nclearance in approximately May 2018. (Answer; Tr. at 5, 18-23, 36-38, 73-74; GE 1, 2; \nAE D) \nThe SOR alleged that Applicant had two delinquent consumer accounts totaling \napproximately $4,749 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a - 1.b), a $335 delinquent medical account (SOR \u00b6 \n1.c), and nine delinquent student loans totaling $56,269 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d - 1.l). The SOR \nallegations are established by Applicant\u2019s admissions in her Answer, her 2019 security \nclearance application (SCA), a 2019 background interview, and by credit bureau reports \nfrom 2017, 2019, and 2020. SOR debt \u00b6 1.c is reported as delinquent on the 2017 credit \nbureau report. All of the SOR debts are reported as delinquent on the 2019 credit bureau \nreport. SOR debts \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.d through 1.l are reported as delinquent on the 2020 credit \nbureau report. (Answer; GE 1-5) \nApplicant attributes her delinquent debts to periods of unemployment from January \n2006 to August 2008, and from September to December 2011; an unpaid leave of \nabsence from May to September 2011, to care for her grandmother who became ill; \nminimal income from 2010 until 2015; and financial hardship in 2015 due to a relocation, \nand residing and continuing to care for her ill grandmother, whose funeral expenses she \ncontributed to financially. She also testified that she discovered that, in 2019, her ex-\nboyfriend stole her identity and opened around six accounts in her name, unbeknownst \nto her. She disputed these debts as she learned about them. She acknowledged, during \nher background interview, that she also incurred delinquent debts due to immaturity and \nnot living within her means.

(Answer; Tr. at 23-26, 51-58, 83; GE 1, 2) \nSOR \u00b6 1.c is for a $335 medical account in collection. Applicant believed this debt \nwas related to a surgery she had in 2009, which she understood was covered by medical \ninsurance. She spent two years trying to get her insurance company to pay for this debt. \nShe paid this debt in March 2018. (Answer; Tr. at 24-27, 61; GE 2, 5; AE A) \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d through 1.l are for delinquent federal student loans totaling $56,269. \nApplicant obtained both federal and private student loans to finance her college education \nand living expenses while she attended college from 2003 to 2010. All of her student \nloans were in forbearance from 2010 until approximately 2011, due to minimal income. In \n2013, she was notified that her federal student loans were approximately $6,000 \ndelinquent. She was unaware that they had been in a repayment status because she did \nnot receive the bills, which were sent to her grandmother\u2019s old residence. She \nunsuccessfully attempted to negotiate a payment plan with the servicer for her federal \nstudent loans between 2013 and 2018, and the servicer told her that she had to pay the \noutstanding delinquency in full. In 2018, when her federal student loans were switched to \na different servicer, she entered into an automatic payment plan of $5 monthly for \napproximately 12 to 18 months and made timely payments in accordance with her \npayment plan. (Answer; Tr. at 27-29, 32, 35-47, 49-50, 58-68, 70-75, 77-83; GE 1, 2; AE \nB) \nApplicant\u2019s federal student loans were placed in forbearance through executive \norder in 2020, due to the Covid-19 pandemic. As of January 2022, they remained in \nforbearance. She intended to resume payments even while her federal student loans \nwere in forbearance, and she planned to timely pay her federal student loans once they \nwere no longer in forbearance. Unlike her federal student loans, she has been repaying \nher private student loans since 2011. She made payments according to a monthly \npayment plan that progressively increased from $25 to $356 monthly, as of the date of \nthe hearing. She was current on her private student loans, and she estimated that the \ntotal balance of her private student loans was $30,000. (Answer; Tr. at 27-29, 32, 35-47, \n49-50, 58-68, 70-75, 77-83; GE 1, 2; AE B) \nApplicant stated that she lived within her means, she timely paid her bills, and she \nintended to continue to timely pay her bills in the future. She rents her mother\u2019s second \nhome, and her mother was in the process of putting Applicant\u2019s name on the deed. She \npaid her mother $1,200 monthly for the mortgage payment and she also paid for all of the \nhousehold expenses. She has a monthly net remainder of approximately $2,500 after \nexpenses, and she has approximately $20,000 in savings and $200,000 in retirement \nsavings. She described her financial situation as \u201cgreat.\u201d She monitors her credit to \nprevent future identity theft and she did not have any other delinquent debts. She also \nstated that she received credit counseling in 2012 and again in 2019.

In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in conjunction \nwith the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. The protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 \n2(b) requires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national \nsecurity eligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation of potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Section 7 of Exec. Or. \n10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall \nin no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See also \nExec. Or. 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access to classified or \nsensitive information). \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \nAnalysis \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nThe security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds . . .. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant was unable to pay her debts. The evidence is sufficient to raise AG \u00b6\u00b6 \n19(a) and 19(c). \nConditions that could mitigate the financial considerations security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 20. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; and, \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay  \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s circumstances, as previously discussed, are conditions beyond her \ncontrol that contributed to her financial problems. The first prong of AG \u00b6 20(b) partially \napplies. For the full application of AG \u00b6 20(b), she must have acted responsibly under her \ncircumstances. She paid SOR \u00b6 1.c before she received the SOR, and I find SOR \u00b6 1.c \nin her favor. As of the date of the hearing, her federal student loans had been in \nforbearance since 2019. From 2013 to 2018, she attempted to reach a payment plan with \nher previous federal student loan servicer. When her federal student loans were switched \nto a different servicer in 2018, she entered into an automatic payment plan of $5 monthly \nfor approximately 12 to 18 months. She intended to pay her federal student loans once \nthey were out of forbearance. \nA security clearance adjudication is an evaluation of an individual\u2019s judgment, \nreliability, and trustworthiness. It is not a debt-collection procedure. ISCR Case No. 09-\n02160 (App. Bd. Jun. 21, 2010). The adjudicative guidelines do not require that an \nindividual make payments on all delinquent debts simultaneously, pay the debts alleged \nin the SOR first, or establish resolution of every debt alleged in the SOR. He or she need \nonly establish a plan to resolve financial problems and take significant actions to \nimplement the plan. See ISCR Case No. 07-06482 at 2-3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008). \nApplicant has the financial capacity to pay her federal student loans and continue \nresolving SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b, with a monthly net remainder of approximately $2,500 \nand $20,000 in savings. She received credit counseling in 2012 and 2019. Her mother, \nwho has a financial background, has also been financially advising her since 2018. I find \nthat AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a), 20(b), 20(c), and 20(d) are established. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the potentially \ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and circumstances \nsurrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-\nperson analysis. Overall, the record evidence leaves me without questions and doubts as \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nto Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance.

The SOR also alleged that in April 2011, while serving in the U.S. Army, Applicant received non-judicial punishment (NJP) under Article 15 the Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ) for violating orders to have no contact with a female co-worker when he confronted her and had an argument with her (SOR 1.b); that in December 2021, he again received Article 15 NJP and was ordered to complete anger management training after he assaulted a female with whom he was in a relationship (SOR 1.c); and that in June 2013, he was administratively separated from the Army and given a general discharge under honorable conditions (SOR 1.d). 2 The SOR further alleged that in August 2014, Applicant was terminated from his civilian employment after arguing with co-workers (SOR 1.e); and that in June 2016, he was terminated from another job for having a relationship with a co-worker at an overseas job site (SOR 1.f).

His request for a security \nclearance is denied. \nStatement of the Case \nOn October 2, 2017, Applicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaire for \nInvestigations Processing (e-QIP) to obtain eligibility for a security clearance in \nconnection with his prospective employment with a federal contractor. Based on the \nresults of the ensuing background investigation, adjudicators for the Defense \nCounterintelligence and Security Agency Consolidated Adjudications Facility (DCSA \nCAF) could not affirmatively determine, as required by Security Executive Agent Directive \n(SEAD) 4, Section E.4, and by DOD Directive 5220.6, as amended (Directive), Section \n1 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n4.2, that it is clearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant Applicant\u2019s \nrequest for a security clearance. \nOn January 3, 2020, DCSA CAF issued to Applicant a Statement of Reasons \n(SOR) alleging facts that raise security concerns under the adjudicative guideline for \npersonal conduct (Guideline E). The guideline cited in the SOR is one of the adjudicative \nguidelines (AG) issued by the Director of National Intelligence on December 10, 2016, to \nbe effective for all adjudications on or after June 8, 2017. \nApplicant timely responded to the SOR (Answer) and requested a hearing before \nan administrative judge from the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA). I \nreceived the case on April 8, 2022, and scheduled a virtual hearing for July 1, 2022. The \nparties appeared as scheduled. I received a transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on July 12, \n2022. \nDepartment Counsel proffered Government Exhibits (GX) 1 \u2013 8. Additionally, a list \nof the Government\u2019s exhibits and a copy of a discovery letter dated January 20, 2022, are \nincluded in the record as Hearing Exhibits (HX) 1 and 2, respectively. Applicant testified \nand produced Applicant Exhibits (AX) A \u2013 H. I admitted GX 5 over Applicant\u2019s objection. \n(Tr. 21 \u2013 22), and I admitted all of the other exhibits without objection.

The SOR amendment and Applicant\u2019s \nresponse are included in the record as HX 3. (Tr. 9 \u2013 11) \nFindings of Fact \nUnder Guideline E, the SOR alleged that in September 2003, Applicant was \narrested and charged with assaulting and harassing his girlfriend and that in January \n2005, the assault charge was nolle prosequi, he was convicted of the harassment charge, \nand he was ordered to complete an anger management class (SOR 1.a).

Finally, Department Counsel amended the SOR to add, as SOR 1.i, an \nallegation that in March 2021, Applicant was arrested and charged with violating another \nDVPO. \nIn response to the SOR (Answer) and the SOR amendment, Applicant admitted \nwith explanations all of the Guideline E allegations. In addition to the facts established by \nApplicant\u2019s admissions, I make the following findings of fact. \nApplicant is 41 years old. In October 2006, he enlisted in the U.S. Army and served \non active duty as an imagery analyst in the military intelligence community. He first \nreceived a security clearance early in his Army career. He deployed to Iraq four times \nbetween 2008 and 2011. In June 2013, the Army administratively separated him for \nmisconduct involving a serious offense. He received a general discharge under honorable \nconditions. (Answer; GX 1; AX I; Tr. 43, 70 \u2013 73) \nAfter leaving the Army, Applicant obtained employment with a series of defense \ncontractors in jobs that required a security clearance and the skills he learned in the Army. \nThose jobs sometimes required Applicant to work in Afghanistan, Iraq, and other \noverseas locations in support of U.S. military operations. He still held the last of those \njobs at the time of his most recent personal subject interview (PSI) with a government \ninvestigator in June 2018. He has since left that job (the record is silent as to when), but \nnow has a pending job offer with another contractor contingent on his eligibility for another \nsecurity clearance. In the meantime, he has been working in the real estate industry. (GX \n1; GX 2; Tr. 37) \nApplicant was married between December 2006 and September 2011. He has one \nchild with his ex-wife from before they were married. He has two other children with an \nex-girlfriend. In September 2003, he and that ex-girlfriend got into an argument and he \nbecame violent, punching the woman in the head with his fist two or three times. A few \ndays later, the police arrested him and charged him with assault and harassment. In court, \nthe assault charge was nolle prosequi and he pleaded guilty to harassment. He was fined, \nplaced on probation for 90 days, and ordered to complete an anger management class. \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAlthough he completed all of the terms of his sentence, he also was jailed for 30 days \nafter failing to appear at one of the hearings in that case. (Answer; GX 1 \u2013 3; Tr. 32, 36 \u2013 \n39) \nIn 2011, while in the Army and assigned in an overseas combat-zone, Applicant \ngot into an argument with a female soldier with whom he worked and with whom he had \nbeen in a relationship. Because the two had gotten into several arguments, Applicant\u2019s \nchain of command ordered him to have no contact with that female soldier outside of the \nworkplace (a joint operations center). In April 2011, Applicant approached the female \nsoldier in an operations trailer and they argued. During the argument, he pushed her \nagainst the wall. Applicant\u2019s deployment was terminated early and he was returned to the \nUnited States. In July 2011, he received NJP for violating a lawful order, an offense \npunishable under UCMJ Article 92. He was reduced in rank from sergeant (E-5) to \nspecialist (E-4), assigned 45 days of extra duty, and ordered to complete anger \nmanagement training. Additionally, his clearance was suspended locally while he \ncompleted his extra duty and the anger management training. His access was restored \nin August 2011 after he completed his punishment. (Answer; GX 1; GX 2; GX 4; GX 6; \nTr. 33, 39 \u2013 41) \nIn December 2012, after Applicant transferred to another overseas duty station, he \nbegan a sexual relationship with a female soldier. He had regained his rank of sergeant \nand the female was a private first class (E-3). One evening he went to her room to tell her \nthat he did not like the fact that she was friendly with other men. The two argued and the \nencounter escalated to the point he choked the female on her bed. Applicant\u2019s command \nsent him back to the United States and awarded him NJP in April 2013 for assault \nconsummated by a battery, a violation of UCMJ Article 128. Although he denies choking \nthe woman, he was found guilty. He was demoted to specialist (E-4), awarded 45 days \nextra duty and placed on restriction for 45 days. He also was fined half of his monthly pay \nfor two months; however, that part of his sentence was suspended for 90 days. \nAdditionally, Applicant was ordered to have no contact with the female soldier and to \ncomplete anger management training. (Answer; GX 2; GX 5; Tr. 33, 41 \u2013 44) \nSometime after his Article 15 punishment, despite having been ordered to have no \ncontact with her, Applicant decided he could approach the female soldier. He believed it \nwas not inappropriate to try to resume their relationship because he no longer was a non\u00ad\ncommissioned officer. His chain of command became aware of this and decided to \ncommence administrative separation proceedings against Applicant. The Army \ndischarged him as a specialist on June 18, 2013. Applicant\u2019s Certificate of Release or \nDischarge from Active Duty, better known as a DD-214, lists \u201cmisconduct (serious \noffense)\u201d as the reason for separation. (GX 2; AX H) \nIn March 2014, Applicant began working for a defense contractor as an imagery \nanalyst in support of overseas U.S. military operations. In that job, he was part of a team \nthat worked in round-the-clock shifts. On August 1, 2014, Applicant was late in reporting \nfor his assigned shift.

He argued with his \nsupervisors, reacting aggressively, profanely, and in a threatening manner towards them, \nas well as towards the government program manager. Applicant was subsequently sent \nback to the United States. His company\u2019s investigation into this incident was well-\ndocumented and showed that Applicant did not take full responsibility for his actions and \nthat Applicant did not want to comply with \u201cstupid little rules\u201d in the workplace. At hearing, \nhe testified about the incident and gave his side of the story, but he stopped short of \naccepting responsibility for his behavior. (Answer; GX 1; GX 2; GX 7; Tr. 44 \u2013 49) \nIn September 2014, Applicant found employment in a similar position with a \ndefense contractor. Again, he was assigned to work overseas in support of U.S. military \noperations. He was fired from that job in April 2016 after violating rules against being in \nthe quarters of someone of the opposite sex. Applicant and a female co-worker had been \nin a romantic and sexual relationship before being sent overseas. Both of them knew the \nrules regarding fraternization. (Answer; GX 1; GX 2; Tr. 49 \u2013 52) \nIn April 2017, Applicant was arrested and charged with assault on a female. The \nvictim in that incident was the same co-worker with whom he had a sexual relationship \noverseas in 2016. Applicant and the victim got into an argument, and he became angry \nand pushed her against a refrigerator, hit her in the face with an open hand, and pushed \nher to the floor. He then left, but returned later the same day and pushed her to the ground. \nThe victim texted a friend and asked her to call the police, and Applicant was arrested. \nShe also obtained a DVPO against Applicant. (Answer; GX 1 \u2013 3; GX 6; AX E; Tr. 33, 55 \n\u2013 57) \nApplicant was unemployed between June and November 2016, when he was hired \nby another defense contractor for imagery work overseas. In April 2017, after his arrest \nfor assault, and before he could deploy for work, he was involved in a traffic accident with \na police car. Applicant insists the police car was at fault. Nonetheless, Applicant was \ndetermined to be under the influence of alcohol and was found to be in possession of less \nthan one-half ounce of marijuana. He was arrested and charged with misdemeanor drug \npossession and DWI. The charges were dismissed when the police officer failed to appear \nin court, having left the police department sometime before the trial date. Applicant admits \nthat he was illegally in possession of marijuana and that he was impaired by alcohol while \ndriving. In June 2017, Applicant lost his job because his legal problems prevented him \nfrom deploying overseas. Thereafter, he was unemployed until September 2017, when \nhe was hired by the defense contractor for whom he worked until he started in the real \nestate industry. (Answer; GX 1; GX 2; AX C; AX D; Tr. 33 \u2013 34, 52 \u2013 55, 68 \u2013 70) \nWhen Applicant was arrested for DWI and drug possession as discussed above, \nhe was held in jail overnight before being released on his own recognizance. After getting \nout of jail, he went to the home of the woman who had just obtained the DVPO against \nhim. He left a note on her door saying he would leave her alone. The next day, he \nappeared in court to answer the assault charge, which was dismissed because the victim \ndid not appear to support the charges.

The victim submitted a letter in support of Applicant\u2019s request for a clearance; \nhowever, that letter makes no mention of the adverse events addressed by the SOR. \n(Answer; GX 1 \u2013 3; GX 6; AX E; AX G; Tr. 33, 55 \u2013 57, 66 \u2013 68) \nOn March 4, 2021, Applicant was arrested and charged with violating a DVPO. He \nand a woman he was seeing in late 2019 or early 2020 got into an argument that became \nso heated that she obtained the protective order for a year. Applicant violated the order \nby contacting her on social media (he \u201cliked\u201d a picture or comment she had posted on \nFacebook). The violation charge was dismissed after Applicant completed an anger and \nemotional management class. The DVPO has since expired. (HX 3; GX 8; Tr. 34 \u2013 35, 57 \n\u2013 61) \nAll of the anger management training or counseling Applicant has received has \nbeen ordered by the military or a civilian court. Apart from engaging in meditation and \nspeaking with a therapist \u201ca few years back,\u201d he has not sought any sustained counseling \nor therapy to address his history of anger-related misconduct or personal relationship \ndifficulties. Applicant testified he believes his anger management difficulties are \nhereditary, because he has seen the same issues in his parents and in his children. (Tr. \n61 \u2013 65) \nApplicant testified that his performance in the Army and in his civilian positions was \nprofessional and noteworthy despite the adverse information presented by the \nGovernment. He presented a letter from an Army officer dated October 4, 2016, after he \nwas sent home for violating fraternization rules overseas. The officer praised Applicant\u2019s \nprofessional expertise and dedication to the mission at hand, but made no mention of any \ntransgressions Applicant may have committed. Applicant also submitted two character \nreferences from military and civilian co-workers. Both authors praised his dedication and \nexpertise. Again, there was no mention of any adverse conduct or other issues raised \nthrough the SOR. His DD-214 lists numerous decorations, including the Iraq Campaign \nMedal with three stars, a Joint Service Commendation Medal, and two Army Achievement \nMedals. (Answer; AX A; AX B; AX F; AX H; Tr. 51 \u2013 52) \nPolicies \nEach security clearance decision must be a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndetermination based on examination of all available relevant and material information, \nand consideration of the pertinent criteria and adjudication policy in the adjudicative \nguidelines (AG). (See Directive, 6.3) Decisions must also reflect consideration of the \nfactors listed in \u00b6 2(d) of the guidelines. Commonly referred to as the \u201cwhole-person\u201d \nconcept, those factors are: \n(1) The nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nThe presence or absence of a disqualifying or mitigating condition is not \ndeterminative of a conclusion for or against an applicant. However, specific applicable \nguidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against them as they \nrepresent policy guidance governing the grant or denial of access to classified \ninformation. A security clearance decision is intended only to resolve whether it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest for an applicant to either receive or continue to have \naccess to classified information. (See Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518) \nThe Government bears the initial burden of producing admissible information on \nwhich it based the preliminary decision to deny or revoke a security clearance for an \napplicant. Additionally, the Government must be able to prove controverted facts alleged \nin the SOR. If the Government meets its burden, it then falls to the applicant to refute, \nextenuate or mitigate the Government\u2019s case. Because no one has a \u201cright\u201d to a security \nclearance, an applicant bears a heavy burden of persuasion. (See Egan, 484 U.S. at 528, \n531) A person who has access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship \nwith the Government based on trust and confidence. Thus, the Government has a \ncompelling interest in ensuring each applicant possesses the requisite judgment, \nreliability and trustworthiness of one who will protect the national interests as his or her \nown. The \u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d standard compels resolution of any \nreasonable doubt about an applicant\u2019s suitability for access in favor of the Government. \n(See Egan; AG \u00b6 2(b)) \nAnalysis \nPersonal Conduct \nAvailable information supports all of the SOR allegations; however, the SOR 1.d \nallegation regarding Applicant\u2019s discharge from the Army does not allege any specific \nmisconduct. Applicant\u2019s DD-214 specified that his discharge was for \u201cmisconduct (serious \noffense),\u201d ostensibly based on the conduct for which he received NJP in December 2012, \nand for his subsequent disregard for orders to have no contact with the female soldier he \nassaulted. However, the SOR addressed that conduct through separate allegations. I find \nthat SOR 1.d is duplicative and it is resolved for Applicant. \nNonetheless, this record reasonably raises the security concern about personal \nconduct under Guideline E, stated, in relevant part, at AG \u00b6 15: \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. \nMore specifically, the Government\u2019s exhibits, along with Applicant\u2019s admissions \nand testimony, require application of the following AG \u00b6 16 disqualifying conditions: \n(c) credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is \nnot sufficient for an adverse determination under any other single guideline, \nbut which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-person \nassessment of questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack \nof candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations, or other \ncharacteristics indicating that the individual may not properly safeguard \nclassified or sensitive information; and \n(d) credible adverse information that is not explicitly covered under any \nother guideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an adverse \ndetermination, but which, when combined with all available information, \nsupports a whole-person assessment of questionable judgment, \nuntrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with \nrules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that the individual \nmay not properly safeguard classified or sensitive information. This \nincludes, but is not limited to, consideration of: . . . \n(2) any disruptive, violent, or other inappropriate behavior; [and] \n(3) a pattern of dishonesty or rule violations. . . . \nThe Government established a prima facie case for disqualification based on \nApplicant\u2019s 18-year record of domestic violence, disruptive behavior in the workplace, \nfailure to follow workplace rules, multiple instances of disregarding lawful orders of his \nmilitary superiors, drug and alcohol-related criminal conduct, and inability to control his \ntemper in a variety of interpersonal contexts. Because most of his arrests resulted in \ndismissal after the complaining party or arresting officer failed to appear in court, \ndisqualification under the criminal conduct guideline might be unlikely. Nonetheless, this \ninformation undermines any confidence in his judgment and reliability, specifically as it \npertains to his ability or willingness to control his impulses or follow rules and regulations \nfor the protection of classified information. \nIn response, it was the Applicant\u2019s burden to present information that would refute, \nextenuate, or mitigate the concerns raised by the Government\u2019s information.

AG \u00b6\u00b6 \n17(c) and 17(d) do not apply because the events and behavior documented by the \nGovernment\u2019s information are numerous and have occurred for most of the past 18 years, \nmost recently in 2021. Applicant has completed involuntary anger management \ncounseling on at least four occasions to no apparent avail. He has not himself engaged \nin any structured therapy or counseling to change his anger issues, and he has not \naccepted responsibility for his actions. AG \u00b6 17(f) does not apply because Applicant did \nnot present information to refute the bases for the SOR allegations or to undermine the \ncredibility of any of the sources of that information. Rather, his testimony largely confirmed \nthe facts established by the Government\u2019s exhibits. On balance, Applicant did not mitigate \nany of the security concerns established by the Government. \nI also have evaluated this record in the context of the whole-person factors listed \nat AG \u00b6 2(d). I am mindful of the positive aspects of Applicant\u2019s military service as well as \nthe positive information about his character and reliability. However, that information does \nnot outweigh the concerns about his long record of misconduct. The record as a whole \nleaves unresolved the doubts about his suitability for clearance raised by the \nGovernment\u2019s information. Because protection of the national interest is the principal \nfocus of these adjudications, any remaining doubts are resolved against the Applicant. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required by section \nE3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline E: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.c, 1.e \u2013 1.i: \nAgainst Applicant \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                     \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.d: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the foregoing, it is not clearly consistent with the interests of national \nsecurity for Applicant to have access to classified information. Applicant\u2019s request for a \nsecurity clearance is denied. \nMATTHEW E. MALONE \nAdministrative Judge \n10 \n",

She denied the allegation in SOR \u00b6 1.i. Her admissions are incorporated in \nmy findings of fact. \nApplicant is a 58-year-old contracts manager employed by various defense \ncontractors from November 2002 to the present. She married in September 1982 and has \ntwo adult children. \nApplicant was a federal employee from March 1986 to December 1993. She \nunderwent a security investigation in 2006 and was granted a clearance on a date not \nreflected in the record. Her SCA reflects that she was cleared for access to sensitive \ncompartmented information (SCI) in December 2011. (FORM Item 3 at 45.) She was \nunemployed from November 2016 to October 2017. About three months after she \nreturned to work in October 2017, her husband lost his job and was unemployed for about \na year, until he found a part-time job. \nAfter a personal subject interview (PSI) with a security investigator in September \n2018, Applicant submitted documentation that four delinquent credit-card accounts were \npaid or settled; a credit card debt of $2,932 was cancelled in 2014; a delinquent credit-\ncard debt of $447 was resolved in January 2015; a delinquent credit-card debt of $208 \nwas resolved in March 2016; and a delinquent dental bill for $1,731 was resolved in \nOctober 2016. These debts were incurred, became delinquent, and were resolved before \nshe became unemployed in November 2016. None of these debts were alleged in the \nSOR. (FORM Item 5 at 3, 4, 6-8, 11-14). I have considered the evidence of these \ndelinquent debts for the limited purposes of deciding which adjudicative guidelines are \napplicable; evaluating evidence of mitigation, and as part of my whole-person analysis \nThe SOR alleges that Applicant failed to timely file her federal and state income \ntax returns for tax years 2016 through 2018 (SOR \u00b6 1.a), that she owes delinquent federal \ntaxes of $10,512 (SOR \u00b6 1.b), and that she owes delinquent state income taxes of \n$11,648 (SOR \u00b6 1.c). The SOR also alleges 11 delinquent consumer debts that are reflect \nin credit reports from April 2019, December 2021, and March 2018 (FORM Items 6, 7, \nand 11.). The evidence concerning the allegations in the SOR is summarized below. \nSOR \u00b6 1.a: failure to timely file federal and state income tax returns for tax \nyears 2016 through 2018. In Applicant\u2019s response to the SOR, she stated that the federal \nand state returns for tax years 2016 and 2017 were late because she and her husband \nhad difficulty obtaining records.

Thus, I am unable to determine if her difficulty in obtaining records was \ndue to disorganization, carelessness, procrastination, or some reason beyond her control. \nHer admission establishes the allegation in SOR \u00b6 1.a that the federal and state returns \nfor 2016 and 2017 were not timely filed. \nApplicant stated that the 2018 return was timely mailed but not received. She did \nnot submit any evidence of timely mailing. She stated that she and her husband filed the \n2018 return again in December 2019 but have been unable to document that filing, \nbecause the IRS is backlogged with processing returns due to the COVID-19 pandemic. \nShe stated that she was told by an IRS representative to \u201cbe patient.\u201d \nSOR \u00b6 1.b: federal tax debt of $10,512. Applicant incurred a federal tax debt of \n$11,410 for tax year 2014. She attributed the debt to a mistake in her return. She provided \nno evidence of the nature of the mistake. She had a payment plan providing for payments \nof $160 per month, and she made three payments in 2018 and one in 2019. The payment \nplan was terminated because she was late filing her returns for 2016 and 2017. Her \nrefunds of $1,225 for 2016 and $4,348 for 2017 were applied to her tax debt. When she \nsubmitted her SCA in February 2018, she calculated that her refund for 2018 would be \n$3,886, which would also be applied to her federal tax debt. In her response to the FORM, \nshe provided documentary evidence that her current federal tax debt is zero. (FORM \nResponse, Exhibit 1.) The documentary evidence establishes that the federal tax debt \nalleged in SOR \u00b6 1.b was paid, albeit involuntarily. \nSOR \u00b6 1.c: state tax debt of $11,648. Applicant owed state taxes of $552 for \n2016; $1,602 for 2017; and $1,705 for 2018. (FORM Item 4 at 5.) In response to DOHA \ninterrogatories in January 2020, She stated that she believed that the state tax debt was \ndue to a mistake made by her husband\u2019s employer, causing a school district tax \nassessment to be paid to the wrong district. She stated that she had entered into a \npayment plan for $100 per month to pay the tax debt. (FORM Item 4 at 6-8.) In her \nresponse to the FORM, she stated that the IRS had rejected their federal return because \nsomeone else had claimed their dependents, that they were required to amend and \nresubmit their state return, that the state erroneously estimated that they owed $11,648, \nand that they had been paying $500 per month since December 2021. They resubmitted \ntheir 2019 state tax return in March 2022, and the state tax transcript reflects that they \nowed $176, not the $11,648 alleged in the SOR. (FORM Response, Exhibit 2.). A state \ntax lien that was imposed on a date not reflected in the record was released in March \n2022. The release recites that the tax debt \u201chas been settled, cancelled- and/or satisfied.\u201d \n(FORM Response, Exhibit 3.) The debt is resolved. \nSOR 1.d: home equity line of credit, past due for $689 with a balance of \n$24,598. After a PSI with a security investigator on September 6, 2018, Applicant \nprovided documentation that a past-due balance was paid in full. (FORM Item 5 at 8.) The \nApril 2019 credit report reflects that the past-due amount alleged in the SOR was incurred \nafter the PSI and after the account was previously brought up to date. (FORM Item 6 at \n2.)

(FORM Item 5 at 2.) \nShe provided no evidence of any other payments. In her response to the FORM, she \nasserted that she was making payments on this debt until it was sold, and that she has \nnot been able to locate who owns the debt. (FORM Response at 2.) She did not provide \nany documentation of the amounts and frequency of her payments after September 2018. \nThe fact that the debts were charged off indicates that the payments were less than \nrequired. She also did not provide any documentary evidence of her efforts to locate the \ncurrent holder of the debt. This debt is not resolved. \nSOR \u00b6 1.f: credit-card account charged off for $1,385. After the PSI, Applicant \nsubmitted evidence of a payment of $267 on this debt in May 2014. (FORM Item 5 at 9.) \nIn response to the FORM, she provided documentary evidence that, as of October 22, \n2021, she was making monthly $300 payments by automatic withdrawals from her bank \naccount. (FORM Response, Exhibit 4.) This debt is being resolved. \nSOR \u00b6 1.g: medical bill for $946. In Applicant\u2019s response to the FORM, she stated \nthat she had been trying for two years to resolve this debt but that the creditor has failed \nto submit the claim to her insurance provider. She did not provide any documentation of \nher efforts to resolve the debt, nor did she explain why she has not contacted her \ninsurance provider directly. The debt is not resolved. \nSOR \u00b6 1.h: credit-card account past due for $185 with a balance of $900. In \nApplicant\u2019s response to the FORM, she submitted evidence of monthly $50 payments \ntotaling $800 on a debt of $972. (FORM Response, Exhibit 5.) The debt is being resolved. \nSOR \u00b6 1.i: unsecured loan placed for collection of $645. In Applicant\u2019s \nresponse to the FORM, she submitted evidence that she settled this debt for $128.95. \n(FORM Response at Exhibit 6.) The debt is resolved. \nSOR \u00b6 1.j: veterinarian bill placed for collection of $495. Applicant disputed \nthis bill on the ground that the veterinarian did not properly treat her dog, causing the \ndog\u2019s death. In her response to the FORM, she stated that the veterinarian agreed to \ncancel the bill. She provided no evidence to support her dispute and no evidence that the \ndebt was cancelled. The debt is not resolved. \nSOR \u00b6 1.k: charge account placed for collection of $288. In Applicant\u2019s \nresponse to the FORM, she stated that she paid this debt \u201cyears ago,\u201d but could not find \nher documentation. It is not resolved. \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.l and 1.m: installment account charged off for $1,824, and line of \ncredit charged off for $1,418. Both debts were charged off in March 2016.

She admitted it in her \nresponse to the FORM, asserting that the debt was paid in full. However, she provided \nno documentation to support her assertion. \nApplicant attributed her financial problems to unexpectedly being laid off in \nNovember 2016, after earning about $110,000 annually, and her husband\u2019s loss of \nemployment for more than a year, followed by his underemployment for a year and a half. \nShe provided no explanation for the delinquent debts that were incurred before she was \nlaid off. Her SCA reflects that she and her husband took a vacation trip outside the United \nStates in April 2017, after she was laid off. (FORM Item 3 at 37-38.) \nFederal income tax transcripts reflect joint adjusted gross income of $241,412 for \ntax year 2014; $198,930 for 2015; $191,577 for 2016; and $118,878 for 2017. (FORM \nItem 4 at 19-25.) Applicant has not provided any information regarding her current income \nor expenses. She told an investigator that she had hired a debt-consolidation service in \nthe spring of 2016 but terminated her contract because the service did not make any \npayments to her creditors. \nPolicies \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 2. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge \napplies these guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \n\u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 15-01253 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2016). \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, \nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-\n31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).  \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-\n20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. . . . An individual who is financially \noverextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or otherwise \nquestionable acts to generate funds. . . . \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified information to raise money. It encompasses concerns about a \nperson\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting classified \ninformation. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information. See ISCR \nCase No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \nApplicant\u2019s admissions and the evidence in record establish the following \ndisqualifying conditions under this guideline: \nAG \u00b6 19(a): inability to satisfy debts; \nAG \u00b6 19(c): a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \nAG \u00b6 19(f): failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local \nincome tax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax as required. \nThe following mitigating conditions are potentially applicable: \nAG \u00b6 20(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not \ncast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \nAG \u00b6 20(b): the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \nAG \u00b6 20(c): the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling \nfor the problem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit \ncredit counseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem \nis being resolved or is under control; \nAG \u00b6 20(d): the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to \nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \nAG \u00b6 20(g): the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax \nauthority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \nAG \u00b6 20(a) is not established.

The mistaken application \nof a school district assessment to her husband\u2019s income appears to have been beyond \nher control. However, the evidence reflects that she had significant delinquent debts \nbefore she became unemployed. Furthermore, she did not act responsibly regarding her \nfederal tax debts. She made payment plans for her federal taxes, but they were \nterminated because of her failure to timely file subsequent tax returns. After her payment \nplans were terminated, she made no further payments, but acted passively, allowing her \ntax refunds to be applied to his debt. \nApplicant did not provide documentary evidence of responsible conduct regarding \nthe consumer debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.e, 1.g, 1.k, 1.l, and 1.m. She did not provide \ndocumentary evidence supporting her claims that these debts were resolved.

It is not established for the federal tax debt \nalleged in SOR \u00b6 1.b, which was collected by involuntary diversion of tax refunds. \nPayment by involuntary collection is not a good-faith payment. See ISCR Case No. 09-\n05700 (App. Bd. Feb. 24, 2011). It is not established for the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.k-\n1.n. Applicant claimed that these debts were resolved, but she submitted no documentary \nevidence to support her claim. When an applicant claims that a debt is resolved, it is \nreasonable to expect him or her to present documentary evidence supporting that claim. \nISCR Case No. 15-03363 at 2 (App. Bd.

However, an applicant is expected to have a \ncredible and reasonable a plan to resolve financial problems and take significant actions \nto implement the plan. See ISCR Case No. 07-06482 at 2-3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008). \nApplicant\u2019s episodic and undocumented efforts to resolve her debts fall short of a credible \nand reasonable plan. Furthermore, many of her efforts to resolve delinquent debts appear \nto have been triggered after she submitted her SCA and realized that her security \nclearance was in jeopardy. An applicant who waits until his or her clearance is in jeopardy \nbefore resolving debts may be lacking in the judgment expected of those with access to \nclassified information. ISCR Case No. 16-01211 (App. Bd. May 30, 2018). \nAG \u00b6 20(g) is established for the tax returns and tax debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, \n1.b, and 1.c.

Oct. 30, \n2014). \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-\nperson concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process \nfactors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \nI have incorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. \nSome of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were addressed under that guideline, but some warrant \nadditional comment. I have considered Applicant\u2019s long service as an employee of a \ndefense contractor, her service as a federal employee, and the fact that she has held a \nsecurity clearance for many years, apparently without incident. Because Applicant \nrequested a determination on the record without a hearing, I had no opportunity to \nevaluate her credibility and sincerity based on demeanor or to question her about her \nefforts to resolve the debts alleged in the SOR. See ISCR Case No. 01-12350 at 3-4 (App. \nBd. Jul. 23, 2003). After weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under \nGuideline F, and evaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude \nApplicant has not mitigated the security concerns raised by her tax delinquencies and \ndelinquent debts. \nFormal Findings \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F (Financial Considerations): AGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a and 1.b: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.c: \nFor Applicant \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.d and 1.e: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.f: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.g: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.h and 1.i: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.j-1.n: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national security interests of the \nUnited States to continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nClearance is denied. \nLeRoy F.

I received the transcript (Tr.) of the hearing on \nOctober 4, 2022. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant is a 43-year-old employee of a defense contractor for whom he has \nworked since December 2017. He was out of work from about June 2016 until \nSeptember 2016 and from May 2017 until December 2017. Between January 2018 and \nJuly 2018 he attended online college classes, but did not earn a degree. He is twice \ndivorced, and he remarried in February 2017. His previous marriages were from 2000 \nuntil 2010, and from 2010 until 2014. He has two stepchildren, ages 17 and 8. He also \nhas three children, ages 11, 10, and 2. He served in the U.S. Army from 1997 until \n2014, when he received an honorable discharge. (Tr. 24, 49; GE 1) \nUnder Guideline F, the Government alleged Applicant\u2019s three delinquent \nconsumer debts totaling about $42,000 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.c). In his SOR Answer, \nhe denied the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b with additional comments. He did not \nrespond to the allegation in SOR \u00b6 1.c, so I have treated his lack of response as a \ndenial. These allegations are established by the Government\u2019s evidence, including \ncredit reports. (Tr. 25-47; Answer; GE 2-7) \nUnder Guideline J, the Government alleged Applicant\u2019s June 2022 arrest and \ncharge of false report to a police officer (SOR \u00b6 2.a). The Government cross alleged this \nallegation under Guideline E (SOR \u00b6 3.a). He did not respond to the allegations in SOR \n\u00b6\u00b6 2.a and 3.a, so I have treated his lack of response as denials. (Tr. 47-66, 69-80; GE \n7-10) \nThe delinquent auto loan in the amount of $19,923 alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.a has not \nbeen resolved. In his Answer, Applicant claimed this debt is fraudulent and has fallen off \nhis credit report because of his claims about its validity. Applicant opened this account \nto purchase a vehicle in 2013. In 2015, he voluntarily surrendered the vehicle back to \nthe dealership as he claimed he was having electrical problems with it. In 2015, he \nattempted to make payment arrangements with the creditor, but was unable to do so. \nHe included this debt in a 2015 Chapter 13 bankruptcy petition that was dismissed that \nsame year, so the debt was not discharged. This debt is listed in the 2018 credit report \nbut not in any subsequent credit reports. (Tr. 25-35, Answer, GE 4, 5) \nThe delinquent personal loan in the amount of $15,320 alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.b has \nnot been resolved. In his Answer, Applicant claimed this debt is fraudulent and has \nbeen disputed because of its \u201cconsistency and validity.\u201d He claimed that this creditor \nwas known to unfairly target young service members, engaged in predatory lending \npractices, and is no longer in business. Applicant opened this account in 2013, and \nused it for every day purchases. He claims that he paid the balance on this account in \nfull prior to his 2015 bankruptcy petition.

(Tr. 35-41; \nAnswer, GE 4) \nThe delinquent auto refinance loan in the amount of $7,271 alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.c \nhas not been resolved. Applicant opened this account in July 2019 for a \u201crefi cash out\u201d \non a vehicle he owned. Applicant\u2019s first missed payment on this account was in August \n2020 and the loan was charged off in September 2021. Applicant claimed that he was in \ncontact with the creditor in July 2020. He claimed he was able to make payments on \nthis account, but he no longer needed or wanted the vehicle, because he had \npurchased another vehicle. He wanted to return the vehicle in order to cancel the loan, \nbut the creditor was not willing to accept his offer. In July 2020, he voluntarily \nsurrendered the vehicle and tried to make payment arrangements on the account \nbalance but was unable to come to an agreement with the creditor. He claimed that \nafter the account was charged off, the account was moved to another creditor and he \nhas been unable to locate that creditor in order to try to make payment arrangements. \nHe claimed that he has been trying to contact them for the last month. This debt \nappears on the 2021 and 2022 credit reports. (Tr. 27, 41-47; GE 2, 6) \nApplicant purchased a home in 2017. He earns $62,000 annually. His take home \npay is about $2,250 every two weeks. He has a 100 percent disability rating with the \nDepartment of Veterans Affairs (VA) and receives $5,500 in monthly benefits. He \nsuffers from a brain injury that is combat related. His wife is a full-time student. He has \ntwo checking accounts with balances of $10,000 and $2,500. He claims that he has \nabout $4,500 left over at the end of the month after paying all his expenses. (Tr. 26, 41, \n66-68) \nIn December 2021, Applicant\u2019s spouse was involved in a traffic accident with \nanother vehicle driven by an off-duty police officer. His spouse and three of his children \nwere in the car and suffered minor injuries. His spouse called him immediately after the \naccident and he drove to the accident scene. When he arrived, he noticed that two of \nhis children were bleeding and another was crying. Applicant was understandably \nupset. The driver of the other vehicle involved in the accident was taking pictures of the \ndamage to both vehicles. In Applicant\u2019s opinion, the other driver was too close to his \nvehicle and was unconcerned with the health of Applicant\u2019s spouse and children. \nApplicant told the other driver to back away from Applicant\u2019s vehicle and an argument \nensued. At some point during this argument, the other driver told Applicant that he was \nan off-duty police officer and showed Applicant his badge. During the argument, the off-\nduty police officer put his hands on Applicant\u2019s chest and his face, and knocked \nApplicant\u2019s hat off his head. Applicant responded by knocking the off-duty police \nofficer\u2019s hat off his head. He and the off-duty police officer were then separated by \nbystanders. (Tr. 25-26, 46-56, 69-72; GE 7-10) \nWhen on-duty police officers arrived at the scene of the accident, Applicant \ninformed them that he wished to file a complaint against the off-duty police officer \ninvolved in the accident. The on-duty police officers directed Applicant to internal affairs \n(IA) and another unnamed police entity with oversight duties.

At this meeting, the officers with IA \ntold Applicant they were not able to substantiate the information he provided them and \nthe other unnamed entity. IA also told him that the information he provided to IA and the \nunnamed entity was inconsistent. Applicant claimed IA did not tell him what these \ninconsistencies were. During this meeting with IA, he informed IA that he wished to drop \nhis complaint against the off-duty police officer. He did not want to ruin the off-duty \npolice officer\u2019s career, but simply wanted him reprimanded for his inappropriate \nbehavior. (Tr. 56-66, 72-80; GE 7-10) \nIn June 2022, Applicant learned that he had a warrant out for his arrest for \nmaking a false report to a police officer. The warrant was filed in March 2022, but he did \nnot know about it until a police officer with IA called him to tell him about it in June 2022. \nHe drove to the police station and turned himself in. At the police station, he was \narrested and charged with making a false report to a police officer. He was released on \nbond. As of the date of the hearing in this matter, these charges are still pending. He \nclaimed that he does not know what information that he provided to either IA or the \nother unnamed police entity is considered false or untrue.

In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds.  \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant has a history of financial delinquencies that includes delinquent \nautomobile and personal loans. The evidence is sufficient to raise AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and \n19(c), thereby shifting the burden to Applicant to provide evidence in mitigation. \nConditions that could mitigate the financial considerations security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 20. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment;  \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \nWhile he claimed to have paid the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.b, Applicant provided no \ndocumentary evidence of payments or favorable resolution of any of the SOR debts. It \nis reasonable to expect Applicant to present documentation about the resolution of \nspecific debts. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 15-03363 at 2 (App. Bd. Oct. 16, 2016). He \ntherefore failed to show that he acted responsibly under the circumstances or that he \nmade a good-faith effort to repay or otherwise resolve the SOR debts. \nApplicant claimed that he disputed the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.a because it was \nfraudulent. However, he did not provide a reason as to why the debt was fraudulent. \nTherefore, he has not provided sufficient evidence of a reasonable basis for his dispute \nof this debt. He also claimed that the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.b was fraudulent. His general \nbelief that this creditor engaged in predatory lending practices without providing \nevidence of fraud specific to his account does not constitute a reasonable basis to \ndispute the legitimacy of this debt. \nApplicant relies on the disappearance of two of these debts (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b, \nboth opened in 2013) from subsequent credit reports. However, there can be reasons \nother than a favorable resolution for debts to no longer appear on a credit report, and he \nhas not provided evidence that these debts were favorably resolved. Applicant\u2019s \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nfinancial issues are ongoing and are, therefore, recent. They continue to cast doubt on \nhis current reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. \nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct \nThe security concern for criminal conduct is set out in AG \u00b6 30: \nCriminal activity creates doubt about an Applicant\u2019s judgment, reliability, \nand trustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person\u2019s \nability or willingness to comply with laws, rules and regulations. \nAG \u00b6 31 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. The following is potentially applicable: \n(b) evidence (including, but not limited to, a credible allegation, an \nadmission, and matters of official record) of criminal conduct, regardless of \nwhether the individual was formally charged, prosecuted, or convicted. \nWhile Applicant admitted being arrested in June 2022 for filing a false report to a \npolice officer, he denied any criminal wrongdoing. He credibly testified that he told the \ntruth when he filed his complaint against the off-duty police officer. There is no evidence \nin the record of what information Applicant provided that the police consider to be false \nor untruthful. Applicant has not been convicted of this or any other crime. The evidence \nin the record amounts to evidence of an arrest, but fails to provide evidence of criminal \nconduct. The Guideline J security concern is not established. \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct  \nThe security concern for personal conduct is set out in AG \u00b6 15: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during the national \nsecurity investigative or adjudicative processes. \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. The following disqualifying conditions are potentially applicable: \n(b) deliberately providing false or misleading information; or concealing or \nomitting information, concerning relevant facts to an employer, \ninvestigator, security official, competent medical or mental health \nprofessional involved in making a recommendation relevant to a national \nsecurity eligibility determination, or other government representative; \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(c) credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is \nnot sufficient for an adverse determination under any other single \nguideline, but which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-\nperson assessment of \nquestionable judgment, untrustworthiness, \nunreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and \nregulations, or other characteristics indicating that the individual may not \nproperly safeguard classified or sensitive information; and \n(d) credible adverse information that is not explicitly covered under any \nother guideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an adverse \ndetermination, but which, when combined with all available information, \nsupports a whole-person assessment of questionable judgment, \nuntrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply \nwith rules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that the \nindividual may not properly safeguard classified or sensitive information. \nThis includes, but is not limited to, consideration of: \n(2) any disruptive, violent, or other inappropriate behavior. \nApplicant credibly claimed that he told the truth when filing his complaint against \nthe off-duty police officer. There is no evidence in the record as to what he told police \nthat they believe is untrue. Therefore, his arrest (without conviction) does not support \nthat he deliberately provided false or misleading information; nor does it support an \nassessment of questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating \nthat the individual may not properly safeguard classified or sensitive information. AG \u00b6\u00b6 \n16(b) and 16(c) are not raised. The conduct the Government alleged in SOR \u00b6 3.a is \nexplicitly covered under Guideline J. AG \u00b6 16(d) is not applicable. The Guideline E \nsecurity concern is not established. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n(1) The nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                   \n \n \n \n                                \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I have considered \nApplicant\u2019s military service and honorable discharge. I have incorporated my comments \nunder Guidelines F, J, and E in my whole-person analysis. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. While the Guideline J and E \nsecurity concerns were not established, I conclude Applicant did not mitigate the \nfinancial considerations security concerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.c: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline J: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 2.a: \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 3, Guideline E:    \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 3.a:   \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIt is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for \na security clearance.

He was diagnosed with Opioid Abuse, uncomplicated, and Major \nDepressive Disorder, recurrent, moderate. (GE 3 at 38; HE 2) He was prescribed Zoloft, \nTrazadone, and Wellbutrin. (Id.) His prognosis vacillated between guarded and good. He \ndecided to end his treatment shortly after a change in his medications. \nApplicant admitted he received the treatment described in SOR \u00b6 1.a. (HE 3) In \nabout 2014, he consumed his spouse\u2019s prescription anxiety medication three or four \ntimes a week until 2016 because he was feeling anxious. (Tr. 52-53) He did not have a \nprescription for his own anxiety medication. (Tr. 52) About four years ago, he also used \nhis mother-in-law\u2019s prescription migraine pain medication because he had pain from \ndoing pushups and physical training in the Army. (Tr. 56-57) \nIn 2015, Applicant was having difficulties in his marriage, and he said he had \nunrealistic expectations about the quality of the housework his spouse was supposed to \nperform. (Tr. 28) At his initial mental-health appointment in October 2015, the provider \nnoted that Applicant described chronic pain and self-medication using his spouse\u2019s \nKlonopin and Loratabs. (GE 3 at 37) \u201cHe admitted to occasional alcohol abuse, but \ndenied any history of blackouts, cravings or withdrawals. He reported chronic anxiety \n[with] weekly panic attack.\u201d (Id.) He attributed his depression to issues in his marriage. \n(HE 3) In 2015, he said he went to counseling once or twice a month. (Tr. 30) \nApplicant\u2019s medical records reflect that he saw a mental-health practitioner from \nOctober 2015, to May 2017.

(Id. at 2) The treatment recommendation was to \ncontinue Wellbutrin (depression), start Zyprexa (depression), start Trintellix (anxiety), \nand stop Zoloft (anxiety). (Id.) The prognosis was good and continued psychotherapy \nwas recommended as needed. (Id.) \nAt his hearing, Applicant said his marriage improved and is much better now than \nit was in 2015.

He has not \nreceived proper interventions for his mental health conditions, and has \nopted to discontinue treatment on his own. Given his minimization of his \nhistory, lack of sufficient treatment, minimal social support, and continued \nrelationship with the individual that he identifies as the culprit for his past \ninappropriate behaviors, his prognosis is guarded. [Applicant\u2019s] judgment, \nreliability, and trustworthiness are likely to be impaired. (GE 4 at 4) \nApplicant said his diagnosis and prognosis may have resulted from anxiety due to \nhis arrest for driving under the influence of alcohol (DUI) and concern about losing his \nsecurity clearance. (HE 3) At the time of his evaluation in 2019, he was taking CBD oil. \n(Tr. 58) He asked his supervisor about using CBD oil, and based on his supervisor\u2019s \nresponse, he stopped using it. (Tr. 59) His use of CBD oil does not raise a security \nconcern. \nDr. L said Applicant \u201cseemed to minimize his problematic history.\u201d (GE 4 at 3) He \nhad physical signs of depression, hostility, and bitterness. (Id.) At his hearing, Applicant \nsuggested he was probably feeling some agitation and hostility because of the length of \ntime the process was taking, and he believed he was doing a good job at work. (Tr. 71) \nDr. L said Applicant had \u201ca history of antisocial behavior,\u201d (GE 4 at 3) and Applicant \nbelieved Dr. L was referring to his lack of attendance at social activities and his orientation \ntowards his family. (Tr. 72) Applicant disagreed with Dr. L\u2019s statement that his friends \nand family were \u201cunsupportive.\u201d (Tr. 72; GE 4 at 3) His mother-in-law and father-in-law \nhave been particularly supportive of him. (Tr. 72) Dr. L said she was concerned about \nApplicant\u2019s \u201ccontinued relationship with the individual that he identifies as the culprit for \nhis past inappropriate behaviors.\u201d (Tr. 73-74; GE 4 at 4) Applicant believed Dr. L was \nreferring to his spouse.

(HE 2) He attended two classes or \ncounseling sessions a week in ASAP during the four months of ASAP treatment.

(Tr. 73) He said he \nrarely consumes alcohol, and when he does, it is usually to a moderate degree at social \nfunctions. (Tr. 37-38) He may not consume any alcohol for four to six months. (Tr. 39) \nHe usually limits his alcohol consumption to two beers. (Tr. 38-39) \nApplicant attended about 25 Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) meetings, and he \nreceived a chip. (Tr. 66) He was unsure whether the chip was for six months or one year \nof sobriety. (Tr. 67) He stopped attending AA meetings in May 2017, because he did not \nbelieve he was an alcoholic. (Tr. 63, 73) He found the AA meetings and the stories of \nothers with drinking problems to be depressing. (Tr. 73) He does not crave alcohol. (Tr. \n73) His support group consists of his family, coworkers, and pastor. (Tr. 40) If he has \ndifficulties, he can talk to his support group and seek their assistance.

(AE A-AE B) He has excellent performance evaluations as an Army \nnoncommissioned officer, except some of the performance reports note that he was \nunable to pass the Army physical fitness test. (AE C-AE N) His character evidence \nsupports his continued access to classified information. \nPolicies \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the \nExecutive Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security \nemphasizing, \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. \nEgan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority \nto control access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether \nan individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. \nThe President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nabout potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nClearance decisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a \ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 7. \nThus, nothing in this decision should be construed to suggest that it is based, in whole \nor in part, on any express or implied determination about applicant\u2019s allegiance, loyalty, \nor patriotism. It is merely an indication the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the \nPresident, Secretary of Defense, and DNI have established for issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \n6 \n\n \n \n                                     \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 at 2 \n(App. Bd. May 2, 1996). \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it \nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d \nISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). The burden of disproving a \nmitigating condition never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 \n(App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if they must, \non the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b). \nAnalysis \nPsychological Conditions \nAG \u00b6 27 articulates the security concern for psychological conditions: \nCertain emotional, mental, and personality conditions can impair judgment, \nreliability, or trustworthiness. A formal diagnosis of a disorder is not \nrequired for there to be a concern under this guideline. A duly qualified \nmental health professional (e.g., clinical psychologist or psychiatrist) \nemployed by, or acceptable to and approved by the U.S. Government, \nshould be consulted when evaluating potentially disqualifying and \nmitigating information under this guideline and an opinion, including \nprognosis, should be sought. No negative inference concerning the \nstandards in this guideline may be raised solely on the basis of mental \nhealth counseling. \nAG \u00b6 28 provides conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying in this case: \n(a) behavior that casts doubt on an individual\u2019s judgment, stability, \nreliability, or trustworthiness, not covered under any other guideline and \nthat may indicate an emotional, mental, or personality condition, including, \nbut not limited to, irresponsible, violent, self-harm, suicidal, paranoid, \nmanipulative, impulsive, chronic lying, deceitful, exploitative, or bizarre \nbehaviors; \n(b) an opinion by a duly qualified mental health professional that the \nindividual has a condition that may impair judgment, stability, reliability, or \ntrustworthiness; \n(c) voluntary or involuntary inpatient hospitalization; and \n7 \n\n \n \n                                     \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(d) failure to follow a prescribed treatment plan related to a diagnosed \npsychological/psychiatric condition that may impair judgment, stability, \nreliability, or trustworthiness, including, but not limited to, failure to take \nprescribed medication or failure to attend required counseling sessions. \nThe record establishes AG \u00b6 28(b); however, AG \u00b6\u00b6 28(a), 28(c), and 28(d) are \nnot established. Further details will be discussed in the mitigation analysis, infra. \nFive mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 29 are potentially applicable: \n(a) the identified condition is readily controllable with treatment, and the \nindividual has demonstrated ongoing and consistent compliance with the \ntreatment plan; \n(b) the individual has voluntarily entered a counseling or treatment program \nfor a condition that is amenable to treatment, and the individual is currently \nreceiving counseling or treatment with a favorable prognosis by a duly \nqualified mental health professional; \n(c) recent opinion by a duly qualified mental health professional employed \nby, or acceptable to and approved by, the U.S. Government that an \nindividual\u2019s previous condition is under control or in remission, and has a \nlow probability of recurrence or exacerbation; \n(d) the past psychological/psychiatric condition was temporary, the \nsituation has been resolved, and the individual no longer shows indications \nof emotional instability; and \n(e) there is no indication of a current problem. \nThe DOHA Appeal Board concisely explained Applicant\u2019s responsibility for proving \nthe applicability of mitigating conditions as follows:  \nOnce a concern arises regarding an Applicant\u2019s security clearance \neligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance \nof a security clearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th \nCir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991). After the Government \npresents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the \napplicant to rebut or mitigate those concerns. See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. The \nstandard applicable in security clearance decisions is that articulated in \nEgan, supra. \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access \nto classified information will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nDirective, Enclosure 2 \u00b6 2(b).  \nISCR Case No. 10-04641 at 4 (App. Bd.

Dr. \nL concluded Applicant has a condition that may impair his judgment, stability, reliability, \nor trustworthiness establishing AG \u00b6 29(b). \nApplicant presented important good character evidence from coworkers and \nperformance evaluations. This evidence from lay witnesses tends to mitigate security \nconcerns. In ISCR Case No. 19-00151 (App. Bd. Dec. 10, 2019) the Appeal Board \naffirmed the grant of a security clearance in a case involving conflicting expert mental-\nhealth witness opinions, and cogently explained the necessity of reconciling opposing \nwitness opinions stating: \nA Judge is required to weigh conflicting evidence and to resolve such \nconflicts based upon a careful evaluation of factors such as the comparative \nreliability, plausibility, and ultimate truthfulness of conflicting pieces of \nevidence. See, e.g., ISCR Case No.05-06723 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 4, 2007). \nA Judge is neither compelled to accept a DoD-required psychologist\u2019s \ndiagnosis of an applicant nor bound by any expert\u2019s testimony or report. \nRather, the Judge has to consider the record evidence as a whole in \ndeciding what weight to give conflicting expert opinions. See. e.g., ISCR \nCase No. 98-0265 at 4 (Mar. 17, 1999) and ISCR Case No. 99-0288 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Sep. 18, 2000).  \nAfter a careful review of the evidence, I believe Dr. L\u2019s 2019 diagnosis and prognosis \ncontinue to be accurate and reliable. Applicant\u2019s lay witnesses did not conduct \npsychological testing, review mental-health records, or engage in an in-depth mental-\nhealth interview of Applicant. The record documents a history of only one problematic \nepisode in March 2016; however, Applicant has not received mental-health counseling \nor treatment from a mental-health practitioner for several years. Dr. L said: \n[Applicant] has not received proper interventions for his mental health \nconditions, and has opted to discontinue treatment on his own. Given his \nminimization of his history, lack of sufficient treatment, minimal social \nsupport, and continued relationship with the individual that he identifies as \nthe culprit for his past inappropriate behaviors, his prognosis is guarded. \n[Applicant\u2019s] judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness are likely to be \nimpaired. (GE 4 at 4) \nThere is no professional opinion to refute the findings in Dr. L\u2019s 2019 evaluation, \nand he did not present persuasive evidence that he no longer is in need of treatment for \nanxiety or depression. I have lingering concerns that Applicant\u2019s mental-health condition \nmay impair his judgment, stability, reliability, and trustworthiness. The absence of \nongoing mental-health counseling may result in an adverse impact on national security. \nSecurity concerns under Guideline I are not mitigated at this time. \n9 \n\n \n \n                                     \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                            \n  \u201cBinge drinking is the most common pattern of excessive alcohol use in the United States.\u201d See the \nCenter for Disease Control website, (stating \u201cThe National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism \ndefines binge drinking as a pattern of drinking that brings a person\u2019s blood alcohol concentration (BAC) to \n0.08 grams percent or above. This typically happens when men consume 5 or more drinks, and when \nwomen consume 4 or more drinks, in about 2 hours.\u201d),\nAlcohol Consumption \nAG \u00b6 21 describes the security concern about alcohol consumption, \u201cExcessive \nalcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable judgment or the failure \nto control impulses, and can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability and \ntrustworthiness.\u201d \nAG \u00b6 22 provides conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying in this case as follows: \n(a) alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while under \nthe influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or other \nincidents of concern, regardless of the frequency of the individual\u2019s alcohol \nuse or whether the individual has been diagnosed with alcohol use \ndisorder;  \n(b) alcohol-related incidents at work, such as reporting for work or duty in \nan intoxicated or impaired condition, drinking on the job, or jeopardizing the \nwelfare and safety of others, regardless of whether the individual is \ndiagnosed with alcohol use disorder; \n(c) habitual or binge consumption1 of alcohol to the point of impaired \njudgment, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed with alcohol \nuse disorder; \n(d) diagnosis by a duly qualified medical or mental health professional (e.g., \nphysician, clinical psychologist, psychiatrist, or licensed clinical social \nworker) of alcohol use disorder; \n(e) the failure to follow treatment advice once diagnosed; and \n(f) alcohol consumption, which is not in accordance with treatment \nrecommendations, after a diagnosis of alcohol use disorder. \nIn March 2016, Applicant consumed two bottles of wine and a six-pack of beer. His \nBAC was .14. He was arrested for DUI. He was diagnosed with Alcohol Use Disorder, \nMild or Medium. The record evidence establishes AG \u00b6\u00b6 22(a), 22(c), and 22(d). \nAdditional discussion is in the mitigation section, infra. \n1\n https://www.cdc.gov/alcohol/fact-sheets/binge-\ndrinking.htm. \n10 \n\n \n \n                                     \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 23 lists four conditions that could mitigate security concerns: \n(a) so much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, \nor judgment; \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her pattern of maladaptive alcohol \nuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and has \ndemonstrated a clear and established pattern of modified consumption or \nabstinence in accordance with treatment recommendations; \n(c) the individual is participating in counseling or a treatment program, has \nno previous history of treatment and relapse, and is making satisfactory \nprogress in a treatment program; and \n(d) the individual has successfully completed a treatment program along \nwith any required aftercare, and has demonstrated a clear and established \npattern of modified consumption or abstinence in accordance with \ntreatment recommendations. \nApplicant credibly described his history of alcohol consumption. He successfully \ncompleted ASAP. His only arrest for an alcohol-related offense was a DUI arrest in March \n2016. His alcohol consumption for the last four years is limited and responsible. He \ncurrently has control of his alcohol consumption, and it has a limited role in his life. \nApplicant has demonstrated a clear and established pattern of modified alcohol \nconsumption. Excessive alcohol consumption and future alcohol-related misconduct are \nunlikely to recur. His history of alcohol consumption does not cast doubt on his current \nreliability, trustworthiness, or judgment. AG \u00b6\u00b6 23(a) and 23(d) apply. Alcohol \nconsumption security concerns are mitigated. \nWhole-Person Analysis  \nIn all adjudications, the protection of our national security is the paramount \nconcern. A careful weighing of a number of variables in considering the \u201cwhole-person\u201d \nconcept is required, including the totality of Applicant\u2019s acts, omissions, and motivations. \nEach case is decided on its own merits, taking into consideration all relevant \ncircumstances and applying sound judgment, mature thinking, and careful analysis. \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge and the PSAB should consider \nthe nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \n11 \n\n \n \n                                     \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), \u201c[t]he ultimate determination\u201d of whether to grant a security \nclearance \u201cmust be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines\u201d and the whole-person concept. My comments under Guidelines I and \nG are incorporated in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were \naddressed under those guidelines but some warrant additional comment. \nApplicant is a 40-year-old senior technical management lead over a team of three, \nsoon to be five employees, and they perform laboratory work in the area of logistics data \nfor a DOD contractor, and he has worked for his current employer since 2014. In 2000, \nhe joined the ARNG, and in 2003, he was activated and sent to Iraq for almost 12 months. \nHis MOS was information systems analyst operator. In 2008, Applicant received an \nhonorable discharge from the ARNG. Shortly after leaving the ARNG, he joined the Army \nReserve, where he honorably served until ETS in 2018. \nThe general sense of his character statements is that Applicant is competent, \nproductive, trustworthy, friendly, intelligent, diligent, and conscientious. They did not \nprovide any negative information about his mental health, work performance, disciplinary \nactions, and alcohol consumption. He is a valued asset to his company. His Army \nperformance evaluations are excellent, and his contractor performance evaluations are \noutstanding. The character evidence supports his continued access to classified \ninformation. \nDr. L provided a detailed discussion of Applicant\u2019s mental-health history, \ndiagnosis, and prognosis. She reviewed his records, conducted a psychological test, and \ninterviewed Applicant. Dr. L diagnosed him with Unspecified Anxiety Disorder, \nUnspecified Depressive Disorder, and Alcohol Use Disorder, moderate. Applicant\u2019s \nresponsible alcohol consumption after his DUI in 2016 establishes that his Alcohol Use \nDisorder is in remission. Dr. L concluded that Applicant\u2019s \u201cprognosis is guarded. [His] \njudgment, reliability, and trustworthiness are likely to be impaired.\u201d (GE 4 at 4) Her \ndiagnosis and prognosis cause persistent concerns about his current eligibility for access \nto classified information in light of the absence of evidence of ongoing mental-health \ncounseling or treatment. \nIt is well settled that once a concern arises regarding an applicant\u2019s security \nclearance eligibility, there is a strong presumption against granting a security clearance. \nSee Dorfmont, 913 F. 2d at 1401. \u201c[A] favorable clearance decision means that the record \ndiscloses no basis for doubt about an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified \ninformation.\u201d ISCR Case No. 18-02085 at 7 (App. Bd.

(HE 2) On March 12, 2020, Applicant provided a response to the SOR \nand requested a hearing. (HE 3) \nOn October 30, 2020, Department Counsel was ready to proceed. Processing of \nApplicant\u2019s case was delayed due to the COVID-19 pandemic. On July 12, 2021, her case \nwas assigned to me. On November 22, 2021, DOHA issued a notice of hearing, setting \nher hearing for December 23, 2021. (HE 1) Her hearing was held as scheduled in the \nvicinity of Arlington, Virginia using the Microsoft Teams teleconference system.

(Tr. 14) The only action that will defeat a statute of limitations defense \nto a debt in state B is a partial payment. (Tr. 14) At the time of her hearing, Applicant was \na resident of state B (Tr. 16). The sole debt at issue resulted from Applicant\u2019s attendance \nat a university in state A, and her student loans borrowed from a state A entity. Applicant \nconcluded the state B statute of limitations would bar a collection action, including an \nadministrative garnishment, originating in state A.

(Tr. 53) Her current net worth, which \nincludes her retirement accounts, is approximately $40,000. (Tr. 99) \nSOR \u00b6 1.a alleges that Applicant has a delinquent student loan for $81,495. \nApplicant disclosed her student loan debt on her February 7, 2019 SCA and during her \nApril 3, 2019, Office of Personnel Management (OPM) personal subject interview. (GE 1, \nGE 5) \nFrom 1998 to 2002, Applicant obtained five student loans from a state A entity. (Tr. \n23, 27-28, 44; GE 2 at 2-4, 7-15) The interest rate on her promissory notes was eight to \nnine percent.

(AE H) On September 12, 2018, the creditor wrote that the \nbalance owed was $81,495. (GE 2 at 1) The June 2016 printout of the \u201ccurrent balance\u201d \nin column (3) does not explain the various columns of figures. (GE 2 at 7-15) The \ndocumentation does not explain why the balance increased $37,618 in 28 months from \nJune 2016 to September 2018. \nApplicant said she made her first payments in 2010 because she may have had a \ndeferment for unemployment or taking classes from her graduation in 2007 to 2010. (Tr.\n33) She understood that her debt was accruing interest while she was in school and\nduring the deferment. (Tr. 33-34) \n \n \nApplicant said she disputed the debt because the creditor said she owes five times \nthe amount she borrowed.

(Tr. 36) She stopped making payments because she had a period \nof unemployment. (Tr. 36) She did not make any payments after 2010 until 2016 when \nher pay was garnished for about two months. (Tr. 38-39) The garnishment was 25 percent \nof her wages. (Tr. 47) In 2016, Applicant emailed the original creditor asking for an \nincome-based repayment plan; and the creditor replied that this was a federal student \nloan program that is unavailable because her loan is a state loan. (AE E) The creditor \nsuggested that she provide evidence of financial hardship or extenuating circumstances \nif she wished to have relief from the garnishment of her pay. (Id.) \nIn 2018, Applicant filed a complaint to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau \n(CFPB) asserting that the original creditor has refused to allow her to pay off each of her \nfive loans individually. (AE F) The CFPB responded that they had no jurisdiction over non-\nfederal student loans. (AE G) \nApplicant believes the interest on her student loan might be compounding on a \ndaily basis. (Tr. 37) She did not believe state A could garnish her pay outside of state A; \nhowever, she believed that if she moved back to state A, the creditor would attempt to \ngarnish her wages. (Tr. 38) She has not made any payments since the garnishment in \n2016. (Tr. 46-47) When the garnishment occurred in 2016, she was working for a state A \ncompany, but she was living and working on an island in the Pacific Ocean. (Tr. 38-39) \nApplicant said she has not heard from the creditor since 2016 or 2017. (Tr. 22) In \n2018, she retained a consumer counsel, Mr. C, to negotiate resolution of the debt. (Tr. \n21, 40) On February 24, 2020, Mr. C wrote: \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nMr. C stated that reasonable offers to settle were made to the collection agent, and \nthey were rejected.

Mr. C did not provide any written correspondence to or from the creditor.  \nMr. C recommended that Applicant not make a partial payment. (Tr. 21-22) In \n2018, the creditor wrote Mr. C and informed him that she owed $81,495. (Tr. 44; GE 2 at \n1) The handwritten notes on the creditor\u2019s letter to Mr. C were made by an unknown \nperson and will not be considered. (Tr. 46; GE 2 at 1) In 2018, the SOR debt was dropped \nfrom Applicant\u2019s credit report. (Tr. 20) She instructed Mr. C to approach the creditor and \nnegotiate a settlement. (Tr. 24) However, Mr. C never wrote the creditor to make an offer \nto settle the debt. (Tr. 48) The last time she asked Mr. C about whether he had heard \nfrom the creditor was in 2020, and Mr. C said he had not heard from the creditor. (Tr. 49) \nThere is no evidence that Mr. C informed the SOR \u00b6 1.a creditor of the address of \nAppellant\u2019s current employer. \nApplicant\u2019s rough estimate of the current amount of the debt is about $60,000 to \n$65,000. (Tr. 45-46, 50) She knows how to use a spreadsheet; however, she elected not \nto use one to determine the amount of her debt. (Tr. 51) She believed that the creditor \nwould garnish 25 percent of her pay if she moved back to state A; however, she did not \nbelieve the debt could be collected in state B. (Tr. 38) \nAn expert on student loan collection actions wrote: \nAdministrative wage garnishment is special and unique. The Higher \nEducation Act (20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1095a) in combination with the Debt Collection \nImprovement Act of 1991 (31 U.S.C. \u00a7 3720D), allow wages to be garnished \nfor default Federal student loans. However, the loan at issue is not a Federal \nloan, and thus Federal law does not apply, nor allow for an administrative \nwage garnishment. \nUnfortunately, [state A] is unique in that its legislature also allows for \nadministrative wage garnishment, pursuant to [state A statute], more fully \ndescribed in [state A statute] - Order to Withhold and Deliver. However, the \nlaw of [state A] regarding administrative remedies stops at its borders for \nthe exact reason pointed out by Administrative Judge Harvey- the Full Faith \nand Credit Clause of the US Constitution only applies to judgments, not \nadministrative remedies. \nIn essence, while a judicial garnishment could cross state lines, time is \nlimited in pursuing someone to obtain a judgment. Administrative remedies \nmay not have a time clock, but they are limited in geography to the state \nwhich enacts such. This is a warning to [Applicant]. Should she ever return \nto [state A], the state could start garnishing her wages, regardless how long \nit has been since she last paid the loan. But, while she remains in [state B] \nor any other state other than [state A], [state A] has no power to reach her \nthrough administrative wage garnishment. \n5 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \nNOTE: Should [Applicant\u2019s] employer have locations in [state A], the \nadministrative remedy could be enforced against the [state A] location. This \nis not [state A] reaching into [state B]. It is [state A] reaching a business \nsubject to [state A] law, that happens to employ [state B] resident. (AE L) \nDepartment Counsel counters that Applicant\u2019s provides no authorities in state B \nindicating an administrative garnishment from state A would not be enforceable in state \nB, and that Applicant\u2019s company might open an office in state A. (GE 6) Theoretically, \nstate A could use an administrative garnishment to obtain a judicial garnishment order in \nstate A\u2019 courts. For the purposes of this decision, I will presume that state A will not file \nan administrative or judicial garnishment of Applicant\u2019s pay with her employer. \nApplicant is current on all of her debts, including her federal student loans, except \nfor the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.a. (Tr. 23-24) Her 2021 credit reports do not contain any negative \nentries. (AE A-AE C) She did not describe any financial counseling or provide a budget. \nApplicant made two trips to Thailand and one trip to Europe over the last seven years for \nvacations. (Tr. 41-42) Her goal in 2022 is to stay current on her debts and to pay down \nher debts. (Tr. 52) Security is aware of the debt, and she does not believe it could be \nused to pressure or compromise her. (Tr. 25) \nApplicant\u2019s counsel argued it is legal malpractice for an attorney to suggest that \nApplicant make a payment to the creditor. (Tr. 107-108, 111-112) He contended that \nprudent legal advice is to wait for the creditor to file a lawsuit because \u201cthat\u2019s never going \nto happen.\u201d (Tr. 107, 111) Her counsel described the student loan as a \u201cusurious loan.\u201d \n(Tr. 109) He recommended against her taking money from her retirement account to \nattempt to settle the SOR \u00b6 1.a debt. (Tr. 113) \nCharacter Evidence \nApplicant loves her employment, helping people, and assisting the Army. (Tr. 25, \n53) She loves the United States and would not take any actions to jeopardize security.\n(Tr. 26, 100)   \n \nApplicant received a three percent merit pay increase in 2019, and she was \nawarded a certificate of appreciation from the commander of an important installation. \n(AE J; AE K) The certificate of appreciation lauded her outstanding work and exceptional \ncontributions to mission accomplishment during October 2021. (AE K) \nSeven character witnesses including family, coworkers, a former employer, and \nfriends made statements on Applicant\u2019s behalf. Her sister and best friend said Applicant \nexpressed frustration to her about the creditor in SOR \u00b6 1.a. (Tr. 57-58) Applicant\u2019s \nbrother-in-law, her sister, and a friend are aware of her disputing for several years her \nresponsibility for repaying her student loan. (Tr. 58, 65, 72) Applicant is conscientious \nabout paying her debts. (Tr. 58, 65) She is passionate about her work and family.

Egan, 484 U.S. \n518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to control \naccess to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual \nis sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The President \nhas authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicant\u2019s eligibility for \naccess to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \nIndustry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nabout potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Clearance \ndecisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a \ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 7. \nThus, nothing in this decision should be construed to suggest that it is based, in whole or \nin part, on any express or implied determination about applicant\u2019s allegiance, loyalty, or \npatriotism. It is merely an indication the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the \nPresident, Secretary of Defense, and Director of National Intelligence have established \nfor issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability.

Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds.   \nThe Appeal Board explained the scope and rationale for the financial \nconsiderations security concern in ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012) \n(citation omitted) as follows: \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an applicant might \nknowingly compromise classified information in order to raise money in \nsatisfaction of his or her debts. Rather, it requires a Judge to examine the \ntotality of an applicant\u2019s financial history and circumstances. The Judge \nmust consider pertinent evidence regarding the applicant\u2019s self-control, \njudgment, and other qualities essential to protecting the national secrets as \nwell as the vulnerabilities inherent in the circumstances. The Directive \npresumes a nexus between proven conduct under any of the Guidelines \nand an applicant\u2019s security eligibility. \nAG \u00b6 19 includes two disqualifying conditions that could raise a security concern \nand may be disqualifying in this case: \u201c(a) inability to satisfy debts\u201d; and \u201c(c) a history of \nnot meeting financial obligations.\u201d The record establishes the disqualifying conditions in \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and 19(c) requiring additional inquiry about the possible applicability of \nmitigating conditions. Discussion of the disqualifying conditions is contained in the \nmitigation section, infra. \n8 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \nFive financial considerations mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially \napplicable in this case: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the\nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit\ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being\nresolved or is under control;  \n \n \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and  \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue. \nIn ISCR Case No. 10-04641 at 4 (App. Bd. Sept. 24, 2013), the DOHA Appeal \nBoard explained Applicant\u2019s responsibility for proving the applicability of mitigating \nconditions as follows:  \nOnce a concern arises regarding an Applicant\u2019s security clearance \neligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance of \na security clearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th \nCir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991). After the Government \npresents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the \napplicant to rebut or mitigate those concerns. See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. The \nstandard applicable in security clearance decisions is that articulated in \nEgan, supra. \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access \nto classified information will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nDirective, Enclosure 2 \u00b6 2(b).  \nThe SOR alleges Applicant owes one student loan debt totaling $81,495 in 2018.  \nA debt that became delinquent several years ago is still considered recent because \u201can \napplicant\u2019s ongoing, unpaid debts evidence a continuing course of conduct and, therefore, \ncan be viewed as recent for purposes of the Guideline F mitigating conditions.\u201d ISCR \nCase No. 15-06532 at 3 (App. Bd.

A component is whether he or she maintained contact with creditors \nand attempted to negotiate partial payments to keep debts current. Applicant did not \nprovide supporting documentary evidence that she maintained contact with the creditor \nin SOR \u00b6 1.a. She did not provide documentary evidence of settlements or written offers \nto settle with the creditor; however, as the debt is with a state A entity, payment in full \nmay be the only resolution. She is credited with making some payments in 2010 and \n2016. Her payments are insufficient to establish a track record of payments, or good-faith \nmitigation of her delinquent SOR debt. \nApplicant\u2019s delinquent student loan debt in SOR \u00b6 1.a does not appear on her \ncredit report. The SOR \u00b6 1.a debt may have been dropped from her credit report. \u201c[T]hat \nsome debts have dropped off his [or her] credit report is not meaningful evidence of debt \nresolution.\u201d ISCR Case No. 14-05803 at 3 (App. Bd. July 7, 2016) (citing ISCR Case No. \n14-03612 at 3 (App. Bd. Aug. 25, 2015)). The Fair Credit Reporting Act requires removal \nof most negative financial items from a credit report seven years from the first date of \ndelinquency or the debt becoming collection barred because of a state statute of \nlimitations, whichever is longer. See Title 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1681c. See Federal Trade \nCommission website, Summary of Fair Credit Reporting Act Updates at Section 605, \nhttps://www.consumer.ftc.gov/articles/pdf-0111-fair-credit-reporting-act.pdf. Debts may \nbe dropped from a credit report upon dispute when creditors believe the debt is not going \nto be paid, a creditor fails to timely respond to a credit reporting company\u2019s request for \ninformation, or when the debt has been charged off. \nApplicant asserts the creditor in SOR \u00b6 1.a has exaggerated the amount of her \ndebt. She did not provide the rate of compounding or even establish with certainty that \nthe debt is compounded. The rule of 72 is commonly used to calculate approximate \ndoubling times. The rule of 72 indicates to find the number of years required to double a \ndebt or investment at a given interest rate compounded on an annual basis, one should \ndivide the interest rate into 72. For example, to calculate how long it takes for a debt \nborrowed or invested at an eight percent interest to double, divide 8 into 72, and the result \nis 9 years. See Lending Tree Refinance website, Finance Formulas, Doubling Time, \navailable at, https://financeformulas.net/ Doubling Time.html. It the interest rate\ncompounds on a monthly or shorter basis, the doubling rate would be sooner. For \nexample, if compounded on a monthly basis, the doubling time would be reduced to about \n8.5 years.  \n \nIf Applicant borrowed about $22,000 in about 2000, and she waited 10 years to \nmake her first payment, the debt would be more than $44,000 in 2010. In 2010, she paid \nthe creditor about $1,600. The remaining debt would double again by about 2019 to about \n$85,000. The debt would increase about $7,000 each year, and is currently about \n10 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n$100,000. A state A administrative decision pertaining to the creditor in SOR \u00b6 1.a \nillustrates how state A utilizes administrative garnishment to collect 25% of a debtor\u2019s pay, \nand a student-loan debt resulting from loans from 1989 to 1996 in that case will likely not \nbe paid for many years beyond the decision year of 2008. (HE 3A) \nApplicant\u2019s consumer attorney, Mr. C, provided reasonable financial advice to \nApplicant about state B\u2019s statute of limitations. State statutes of limitations for various \ntypes of debts range from 2 to 15 years. See Nolo Law for All website, Chart: Statutes of \nLimitations \nin \nAll \n50 \nStates, \nhttp://www.nolo.com/legal-encyclopedia/statute-of-\nlimitations-state-laws-chart-29941. html. According to the Federal Trade Commission, \nConsumer Information webpage, it is illegal under the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act \nfor \na \ncreditor \nto \nthreaten \nto \nsue \nto \ncollect \na \ntime-barred \ndebt. \nhttp://www.consumer.ftc.gov/articles/0117-time-barred-debts. The South Carolina Court \nof Appeals succinctly explained the societal and judicial value of application of the statute \nof limitations: \nStatutes of limitations embody important public policy considerations in that \nthey stimulate activity, punish negligence and promote repose by giving \nsecurity and stability to human affairs. The cornerstone policy consideration \nunderlying statutes of limitations is the laudable goal of law to promote and \nachieve finality in litigation. Significantly, statutes of limitations provide \npotential defendants with certainty that after a set period of time, they will \nnot be [haled] into court to defend time-barred claims. Moreover, limitations \nperiods discourage plaintiffs from sitting on their rights. Statutes of \nlimitations are, indeed, fundamental to our judicial system. \nCarolina Marine Handling, Inc. v. Lasch, 363 S.C. 169, 175-76, 609 S.E.2d 548, 552 (S.C. \nCt. App. 2005) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted). South Carolina case law \nis not binding on state courts in other states. However, the South Carolina Court of \nAppeals\u2019 description of the basis for this long-standing legal doctrine is instructive. See \nalso Tulsa Professional Collection Services, Inc. v. Pope, 485 U.S. 478, 486 (1988) \n(where the U.S. Supreme Court noted that \u201cThe State\u2019s interest in a self-executing statute \nof limitations is in providing repose for potential defendants and in avoiding stale claims.\u201d). \nApplicant lived in two states with the following relevant statutes of limitations (SL) \nfor the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.a: state A is three years (written contracts); state A is 10 years \n(collection of debt on account); and state B is six years (written contracts). See \nCredit.Com website, https://www.credit.com/debt/statutes-of-limitations/. Once Applicant \nstopped making payments, the creditor had to file suit within the statute of limitations to \nmaintain the collectability of their debt. There is no evidence that the creditor in SOR \u00b6 \n1.a took judicial action in court to pursue collection of her debt.  \nIn 2016, state A obtained an administrative garnishment order and garnished \nApplicant\u2019s pay for two months. State A can file another administrative garnishment order \nif the state discovers the address of her employer. See, e.g., HE 3B. However, Applicant \nbelieves her employer would not enforce the order because she lives and works in state \n11 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nB. Assuming Applicant\u2019s debt in SOR \u00b6 1.a is collection barred in state B, it is still relevant \nto financial considerations security concerns: \nApplicant\u2019s argument concerning the unenforceability of the largest debt \ndue to the running of the statute of limitations fails to demonstrate the Judge \nerred. First, security clearance decisions are not controlled or limited by \nstatutes of limitations. Second, absent an explicit act of Congress to the \ncontrary, the Federal Government is not bound by state law in carrying out \nits functions and responsibilities. Applicant does not cite to any Federal \nstatute that requires the Federal Government to be bound by state law in \nmaking security clearance decisions. Third, a security clearance \nadjudication is not a proceeding aimed at collecting an applicant\u2019s personal \ndebts. Rather, it is a proceeding aimed at evaluating an applicant\u2019s \njudgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. Accordingly, even if a delinquent \ndebt is legally unenforceable under state law, has been discharged in a \nbankruptcy, or is paid, the Federal Government is entitled to consider the \nfacts and circumstances surrounding an applicant\u2019s conduct in incurring and \nfailing to satisfy the debt in a timely manner. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 01-\n09691 at 3 (App. Bd. Mar. 27, 2003). In this case, the Judge\u2019s consideration \nof the unenforceable debt in making her security clearance eligibility \ndetermination was not arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law. \nISCR Case No. 15-02326 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct. 14, 2014).  The Appeal Board has \u201cheld that \nreliance on a state\u2019s statute of limitations does not constitute a good-faith effort to resolve \nfinancial difficulties and is of limited mitigative value.\u201d ISCR Case No. 15-01208 at 3 (App. \nBd.

Oct. 18, 2007)  \n(reversing grant of security clearance and stating \u201creliance upon legal defenses such as \nthe statute of limitations does not necessarily demonstrate prudence, honesty, and \nreliability; therefore, such reliance is of diminished probative value in resolving \ntrustworthiness concerns arising out of financial problems\u201d (citing ISCR Case No. 03-\n20327 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, 2006)). \nApplicant did not describe any financial counseling. There is not clear evidence \nthat the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.a is being resolved. I have assumed that Applicant could not be \nheld financially responsible for the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.a in state B. However, she did not \nprovide sufficient documentation about why she was unable to make greater documented \nprogress resolving the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.a. There is insufficient assurance that this financial \nproblem is being resolved. Under all the circumstances, she failed to establish mitigation \nof financial considerations security concerns. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \n12 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n     \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nconduct and all the circumstances.

My comments under Guideline F are \nincorporated in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were \naddressed under that guideline but some warrant additional comment. \nApplicant is 46 years old, and a government contractor has employed her as a real \nproperty subject-matter expert and trainer. She has worked either as a federal employee \nor federal contractor with some breaks in employment for the last nine years. In 2007, \nshe received a bachelor\u2019s degree in history at a university in state A. She worked in \ninterior design and space planning for 13 years. \nApplicant presented important good-character information. She loves helping \npeople, her employment, assisting the Army, and the United States, and she would not \ntake any actions to jeopardize security. She received a three-percent merit pay increase \nin 2019, and she was awarded a certificate of appreciation from the commander of an \nimportant installation, lauding her outstanding work and exceptional contributions to \nmission accomplishment during October 2021. \nSeven character witnesses including family, coworkers, a former employer, and \nfriends made statements on Applicant\u2019s behalf. Applicant is conscientious about paying \nher debts. She is passionate about her work and family. The general sense of her \ncharacter statements is that Applicant has excellent integrity, and is detail oriented, \ndiligent, trustworthy, responsible, professional, honest, and reliable. She made important \ncontributions to mission accomplishment. Their statements support approval of her \naccess to classified information. \nApplicant provided important financial mitigating information. Her finances were \nharmed by several circumstances beyond her control. All of her debts are current, except \nfor the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.a. \nThe evidence against grant of a security clearance is more substantial at this time. \nApplicant did not provide documentation about why she was unable to make greater \ndocumented progress resolving the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.a after the garnishment in 2016. \nApplicant did not provide a persuasive reason why she did not inform the creditor of her \n13 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_________________________ \ncurrent address, current employer\u2019s address, and offer to pay 25 percent of her pay to \naddress her student loan debt or enable a voluntary garnishment of her pay after she \nbecame employed.

Jan. 3, 2020) (citing ISCR Case \nNo.12-00270 at 3 (App. Bd.

Applicant\u2019s admissions are incorporated into the findings of fact. After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings, testimony, and exhibits submitted, I make the following findings of fact. Applicant is 58 years old. He attended college for two years, but did not earn a degree. He was married from 1987 to 1991 and from 1996 to 2015. He has one adult child from his last marriage. He served in the military from 1983 to 1987 and was honorably discharged. Applicant was employed from June 2012 to April 2014 by a federal contractor. He worked for a commercial contractor from April 2014 to June 2014 and was unemployed from June 2014 to February 2016. Since February 2016, he has been employed by a federal contractor. His current salary is $93,000. (Transcript (Tr.) 17-25; GE 1) Applicant attributed his financial problems to his period of unemployment from June 2014 to February 2016 and his 2015 divorce. The SOR alleges two charged-off credit card debts (\u00b6 1.a - $17,514 and \u00b6 1.b - $10,060), two medical collection accounts (1.c - $1,126 and 1.d - $1,552) and approximately $7,000 of unpaid federal income taxes (\u00b6 1.e).

He attended college for two years, but did not earn a \ndegree. He was married from 1987 to 1991 and from 1996 to 2015. He has one adult \nchild from his last marriage. He served in the military from 1983 to 1987 and was \nhonorably discharged. Applicant was employed from June 2012 to April 2014 by a federal \ncontractor. He worked for a commercial contractor from April 2014 to June 2014 and was \nunemployed from June 2014 to February 2016. Since February 2016, he has been \nemployed by a federal contractor. His current salary is $93,000. (Transcript (Tr.) 17-25; \nGE 1) \nApplicant attributed his financial problems to his period of unemployment from \nJune 2014 to February 2016 and his 2015 divorce. The SOR alleges two charged-off\ncredit card debts (\u00b6 1.a - $17,514 and \u00b6 1.b - $10,060), two medical collection accounts \n(1.c - $1,126 and 1.d - $1,552) and approximately $7,000 of unpaid federal income taxes\n(\u00b6 1.e). The allegations are corroborated by Applicant\u2019s admissions in his security\nclearance application (SCA), statements made to a government investigator, and credit \nreports from February 2018, May 2019, January 2021, and October 2022. (GE 1, 2, 3, 4,\n5, 6, 7; AE E) \n \n \n \n \n \n \nIn Applicant\u2019s January 2018 SCA, he disclosed that he failed to file his 2015 federal \nincome tax return because he and his wife were going through a divorce, and he believed \nshe had filed a joint return for them. She filed her 2015 federal tax return as single. In \nApplicant\u2019s SCA, he stated, \u201cI have cleared this up and paid all monies owed.\u201d He also \nsaid in his SCA that he resolved that tax debt in 2016 and he paid what he owed and \nowed nothing additional. (GE 1) \nApplicant was interviewed by a government investigator in December 2018. During \nthe interview, he told the investigator that in 2017, he received a notice from the IRS that \nhe had failed to file his 2014 federal income tax return and he owed $10,000. Applicant \nsaid he was aware that the IRS had seized his refunds for subsequent tax years, but he \nnever contacted the IRS to make payment arrangements. He said he filed the delinquent \n2014 federal tax return in 2017. He said he relied on the IRS to withhold his refunds until \nthe tax debt was paid.

He testified that he never made any \nvoluntary payments to the IRS. It is unknown if the delinquent filing was for tax year 2014 \nor 2015. (GE 6) \nApplicant testified that when he was going through his divorce he thought his wife \nwould file their tax return as joint, but she filed single for tax year 2015. He was unaware \nuntil he received a notice from the IRS in approximately 2017 about his delinquent 2015 \ntaxes, but failed to make payment arrangements with them. He said he received two or \nthree letters advising him of the tax debt and the last one was in 2021.He called the IRS \non the telephone, but got tired of waiting on hold. He received the SOR in June 2020 that \nalleged his delinquent tax debt. He reiterated that he relied on the IRS to withhold any \nrefund he was to receive and apply it to his delinquent tax debt. Applicant has not \ncontacted the IRS to make payment arrangements to pay his delinquent taxes. (Tr. 26-\n35) \nPost-hearing, Applicant provided documents to show that on October 19, 2022, he \nemployed the services of a tax relief company (TRC). Based on the emails he provided, \nthe TRC is investigating his tax issues and he had an appointment to meet with them on \nNovember 1, 2022. No evidence was presented to show Applicant has made any \npayments on his tax debt with the IRS. (AE A, B, C, D) \nApplicant admitted he owed the credit card debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b and that \nhe is the sole owner of the accounts. His credit reports show that both debts were charged \noff and the date of last activity was in 2016. Applicant disclosed both debts in his SCA \nand said he had some financial difficulties due to his divorce, but he was working to pay \nback both creditors. He said he was working with each of these creditors to make payment \narrangements to pay the debts. (Tr. 35-37; GE 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7) \nDuring his background interview, Applicant told the government investigator that \nhe did not have the money to pay these accounts. He said he did not intend to pay the \naccount in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b, because he does not have the money. At his hearing, he \ntestified that he was making $20 payments twice a month for three years on the debt in \nSOR \u00b6 1.b that had a charged-off balance of $10,060. He said he has no idea what the \ncurrent balance is on the debt. He testified that he had made no effort to repay the debt \nin SOR \u00b6 1.a. He explained the reason he did not pay these debts was that he was angry \nwith his ex-wife. In his background interview, he told the investigator he used the credit \ncards for living expenses. In his post-hearing email, he confirmed he has not made an \neffort to repay the credit card debt in SOR \u00b6 1.a. He agreed to provide proof that he has \nbeen making payments on the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.b, but did not. (Tr. 35-41; GE 6) \nApplicant testified that he paid the collection accounts for medical services alleged \nin SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c and 1.d, and he would provide documentary proof of the resolution of these \ndebts.

He did not provide proof he paid the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.d. (Tr. \n41-47; GE 5) \nApplicant testified that he purchased a 2020 sports car two months ago for \n$73,000. He traded in his 2016 sports car, which he purchased in 2017, which he was \nmaking approximately $1,300 monthly payments. His new vehicle loan reduced his car \npayment to $1,000 a month. He has about $1,200 in his checking account and $5,000 in \nhis saving account. He has not participated in financial counseling. He has a pension \nplan, but no other investments. He withdrew money from his pension plan in 2014 to pay \nhis medical expenses because he was unemployed and did not have medical insurance. \nHe did not pay the taxes at the time of the withdrawal. He does not provide financial \nsupport for anyone. (Tr. 48-56) \nTwo witnesses testified on behalf of Applicant. His supervisor stated that he has \nknown Applicant for about six or seven years. He described him as reliable, responsible, \nand exemplary. He completes the tasks assigned and the customers provide positive \nfeedback on his work. Applicant has not had any disciplinary action. (Tr. 57-62) \nThe other witness testified that he has known Applicant both personally and \nprofessionally for about 20 to 25 years. Their children played soccer together and \nApplicant is his daughter\u2019s coach. He is a dedicated family man. In his work capacity, \nApplicant is an outstanding employee. He is kind, honest, hardworking, punctual, and a \nvaluable asset to the command and the nation. (Tr. 63-67) \nApplicant testified that he would never put his country in danger and disclose \nsensitive information. He has had a clearance for many years without incident. His family \nmembers have served in the military and he is dedicated to his country. \nApplicant repeatedly made contradictory statements and misrepresentations in his \nSCA, his answer to the SOR, his interview with the government investigator, and in his \ntestimony during his hearing. I did not find him credible. \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility, the administrative judge \nmust consider the AG. In addition to brief introductory explanations for each guideline, \nthe adjudicative guidelines list potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating \nconditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified \ninformation. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere \nspeculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 states an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for financial considerations is set out \nin AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information.

An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nAG \u00b6 19 provides conditions that could raise security concerns. The following are \npotentially applicable: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; \n(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so;  \n(c) a history of no meeting financial obligations; and  \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired.  \nApplicant owes approximately $7,000 in federal income taxes that remains unpaid. \nHe has been aware of his tax debt for years and has not made any voluntarily payments \ntoward its resolution. He also has two credit card debts with significant balances that were \ncharged-off and two medical debts that were in collection status. He does not intend to \npay one of the credit cards. There is sufficient evidence to support the application of the \nabove disqualifying conditions. \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising \nfrom financial difficulties. The following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially \napplicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a none-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority \nto file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \nApplicant made inconsistent statements in his SCA, his interview with the \ngovernment investigator, and his hearing testimony regarding his federal tax debt. In his \nJanuary 2018 SCA, he explained he was confused and believed his wife was going to file \ntheir 2015 federal income tax return jointly. He later learned she filed as single. He said \nhe received a letter from the IRS in 2017 advising him of his delinquent filing and tax debt. \nHe said in his SCA that he paid what he owed. He later told the government investigator \nthat he owed the IRS about $7,000 and was going to contact them in January 2019 to \nmake payment arrangements. In his answer to the SOR, he said he paid the IRS $1,800 \nin February 2020 and was making monthly payments of $100. The $1,800 payment may \nhave been an involuntary withholding by the IRS of a tax refund. Applicant did not provide \nevidence to substantiate any payments. At his hearing, he testified that he has never \ncontacted the IRS and is resolving the delinquent tax debt through the involuntary \nwithholding by the IRS of his tax refunds. After his hearing, he contacted TRC to help him \naddress his tax issues. There is no evidence he has made an arrangement with the IRS \nto pay his delinquent federal taxes. AG \u00b6 20(g) does not apply. \nApplicant attributed his financial problems to his 2015 divorce and extended period \nof unemployment in 2014 to 2016. These were conditions beyond his control. For the full \napplication of AG \u00b6 20(b), Applicant must have acted responsibly under the \ncircumstances. He has not done so. He has been employed since February 2016, more \nthan six years. He has failed to address his tax debt, despite repeatedly asserting he \nwould do so. He acknowledged he owed two large credit card debts that were chargedoff \nin 2016. He has made no effort to pay the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.a because he is angry with his \nex-wife. AG \u00b6 20(b) has minimal application. \nApplicant is making small payments on the charged-off credit card debt in SOR \u00b6 \n1.b, but his efforts do not rise to a good-faith effort to repay the creditor. Applicant recently \npurchased a vehicle for $73,000 and admitted his car payment was reduced by $300. He \nhas not increased the payments to resolve his credit card debt. Applicant has the \nresources to resolve the debt but chooses to make minimal payments on the large debt. \nBased on the balance owed, it will be more than 20 years before he pays the current \nbalance. His actions do not reflect a reasonableness or adherence to duty. He is merely \nrelying on a small payment toward the debt to claim the \u201cgood faith\u201d mitigating condition. \nHe is given credit for making some payments, but the evidence does not support the full \napplication of AG \u00b6 20(d). This mitigating condition does apply to the medical account in \nSOR \u00b6 1.c that he paid. \nThe DOHA Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a \u201cgood faith\u201d \neffort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts: \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n       \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nIn order to qualify for application of [the \u201cgood faith\u201d mitigating condition], an \napplicant must present evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or some other good-faith action aimed at resolving the \napplicant\u2019s debts. The Directive does not define the term \u201cgood-faith.\u201d \nHowever, the Board has indicated that the concept of good-faith \u201crequires \na showing that a person acts in a way that shows reasonableness, \nprudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.\u201d ISCR Case No. \n02-30304 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2004) (quoting ISCR Case No. 99-9020 at \n5-6 (App. Bd. June 4, 2001)).   \nApplicant has not had financial counseling and there are not clear indications his \nfinances are under control. AG \u00b6 20(c) does not apply. His failure to pay his tax debt, his \ncredit card debts and a medical bill casts doubt on his reliability, good judgment, and \ntrustworthiness. His financial issues are recent and ongoing. AG \u00b6 20 (a) does not apply. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline F in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were \naddressed under that guideline, but some warrant additional comment. \nApplicant has been aware since at least 2017 that he owes the IRS federal income \ntaxes. His past statements and testimony regarding actions and efforts to address the \ndebt are not persuasive. He has procrastinated for years and has not voluntarily made \npayments. He has not attempted to resolve his large credit card debt and does not intend \nto do so. His minimal payments on his other large credit card debt raises questions about \nhis commitment to resolving the debt. Applicant has not met his burden of persuasion. \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                          \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nThe DOHA Appeal Board also has held that: \nSomeone who fails repeatedly to fulfill his or her legal obligations does not \ndemonstrate the high degree of good judgment and reliability required of \nthose granted access to classified information. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. \n14-01894 at 5 (App. Bd. August 18, 2015). See Cafeteria & Restaurant \nWorkers Union Local 473 v. McElroy, 284 F.2d 173, 183 (D.C.

The record evidence leaves me \nwith questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security \nclearance. For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant failed to mitigate the security \nconcerns arising under Guideline F, financial considerations. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.b: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph   1.c:  \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.d-1.e: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national security to grant Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security \nclearance.

He admitted that his stepmother, two stepbrothers, and cousin are resident citizens of Pakistan, but he denied any current contact with his stepmother or stepbrothers. He stated that he has infrequent interactions with his cousin \u201cas she takes care of a house that [he] inherited from [his] father.\u201d Applicant admitted the allegations concerning his and his spouse\u2019s financial and property interests in Pakistan.

Processing of the case to a hearing was delayed because of the \nCOVID-19 pandemic. On February 17, 2021, a DOHA Department Counsel indicated that \nthe Government was ready to proceed to a hearing. On March 8, 2021, the case was \nassigned to me to conduct a hearing to determine whether it is clearly consistent with the \nnational security interests of the United States to grant or continue a security clearance \nfor Applicant. I received the case file and assignment on March 12, 2021. \nOn March 15, 2021, I informed Applicant of the option of having a virtual hearing \nonline using the Defense Collaboration Services (DCS) system. Applicant requested an \nin-person hearing, which caused further delay in scheduling due to pandemic-related \ntravel restrictions for the Government. After some coordination with the parties, on \nOctober 22, 2021, I scheduled an in-person hearing for Applicant to be held on December \n2, 2021. \nAt the hearing held as scheduled, the Government withdrew Guideline B allegation \nSOR \u00b6 1.c. One Government exhibit (GE 1) and 11 Applicant exhibits (AEs A-K) were \nadmitted in evidence without any objections. Applicant objected to my consideration of a \nsummary report of his subject interviews, which was proposed as GE 2, and the document \nwas not admitted in evidence due to lack of authentication under \u00b6 E3.1.20 of the \nDirective. At the Government\u2019s request, I incorporated into the record a Request for \nAdministrative Notice Islamic Republic of Pakistan, dated April 6, 2020, as a hearing \nexhibit (HE I), as set forth below. Applicant testified, as reflected in a hearing transcript \n(Tr.) received on December 10, 2021. \nAfter the hearing, I reopened the record for comment from both parties as to my \nconsideration of updated State Department publications. In his response dated February \n5, 2022, Applicant made some representations that were evidentiary in nature. His \nresponse was entered into the record as AE L without any objections from the \nGovernment. \nRuling on Request for Administrative Notice \nAt the hearing, the Government submitted a request for administrative notice \nconcerning the Islamic Republic of Pakistan (Pakistan) dated April 6, 2020. The \nGovernment\u2019s request for administrative notice was based, in part, on eight publications \nof the U.S. State Department: Pakistan 2018 Human Rights Report, dated March 3, 2019; \nPakistan Travel Advisory, dated January 31, 2020; Security Alert \u2013 U.S. Embassy \nIslamabad, Pakistan, dated January 3, 2020; Security Alert \u2013 U.S. Consulate General \nLahore, Pakistan, dated January 7, 2020; Security Alert \u2013 U.S. Consulate General \nLahore, Pakistan, dated January 11, 2020; 2018 Country Reports on Terrorism, dated \nOctober 2019; Pakistan 2019 Crime and Safety Report: Lahore, dated July 2, 2019; \nPakistan 2019 Crime and Safety Report: Peshawar, dated July 3, 2019.

Department \nCounsel provided extracts of the source documents and the URLs where the full \ndocuments could be obtained. Applicant confirmed that he received the Government\u2019s \nrequest for administrative notice with the extracts. \nPursuant to my obligation to take administrative notice of the most current political \nconditions in evaluating Guideline B concerns (see ISCR Case No. 05-11292 (App. Bd. \nApr. 12, 2007)), I informed the parties that I would take administrative notice of the facts \nrequested by the Government with respect to Pakistan, subject to the relevance and \nmateriality of the source documentation, including whether the facts are substantiated by \nreliable government sources, and subject to any valid objections from Applicant. As his \nrebuttal to the Government\u2019s request, Applicant provided information about Pakistan for \nmy consideration in AEs C-I. \nThe Government\u2019s request of April 6, 2020, was not based on current information \nin several aspects. Under Appeal Board precedent, the administrative judge is required \nto take notice, even sua sponte, of current official pronouncements of the U.S. \ngovernment which have a bearing on the issues to be resolved in a given case. In that \nregard, I noted that the U.S. State Department had issued its 2020 Country Reports on \nHuman Rights Practices: Pakistan, on March 30, 2021. An updated bilateral relations fact \nsheet, U.S. Relations with Pakistan, was issued on January 20, 2021. On November 15, \n2021, the State Department issued an updated Pakistan Travel Advisory. These \ndocuments were issued before Applicant\u2019s hearing. Accordingly, I informed the parties on \nJanuary 30, 2022, that I intended to review these publications of the State Department \nfor administrative notice purposes. I provided them with the URLs where the documents \ncould be accessed, and gave them a response deadline of February 11, 2022. \nApplicant responded on February 5, 2022. He did not object to my consideration \nof the updated documents, but asked that I take into account the historical relationship \nbetween the United States and Pakistan. The Government did not file any objections to \nthe updated documents. Accordingly, copies of the publications were incorporated in the \nrecord as HEs II-IV for administrative notice purposes. \nFindings of Fact \nThe amended SOR alleges under Guideline B that Applicant\u2019s father and \nstepmother (SOR \u00b6 1.a), two stepbrothers (SOR \u00b6 1.b), and a cousin (SOR \u00b6 1.d) are \nresident citizens of Pakistan; that Applicant\u2019s father transferred property to him in 2016 \n(SOR \u00b6 1.e); that Applicant has two bank accounts in Pakistan with about $16,000 on \ndeposit (all values in US dollars unless specified as rupees) (SOR \u00b6 1.f); that Applicant\u2019s \nspouse owns two properties in Pakistan valued at approximately $160,000 (SOR \u00b6 1.g); \nthat Applicant\u2019s spouse has a bank account in Pakistan with about $2,000 on deposit \n(SOR \u00b6 1.h); and that Applicant possesses an overseas Pakistan identification (ID) card \nto conduct monetary transactions in Pakistan (SOR \u00b6 1.i). \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \nWhen Applicant responded to the SOR, he explained that his father died in 2018. \nHe admitted that his stepmother, two stepbrothers, and cousin are resident citizens of \nPakistan, but he denied any current contact with his stepmother or stepbrothers. He \nstated that he has infrequent interactions with his cousin \u201cas she takes care of a house \nthat [he] inherited from [his] father.\u201d Applicant admitted the allegations concerning his and \nhis spouse\u2019s financial and property interests in Pakistan. He also admitted that he \npossesses an Overseas Pakistan ID card because it is required to conduct monetary \ntransactions in Pakistan. He asked that he be allowed to retain the security clearance he \nhas held for almost 15 years. \nAfter considering the pleadings, exhibits, and transcript, I make the following \nfindings of fact. \nApplicant is 67 years old. He was born and raised in Pakistan as were his two \nsisters. Applicant\u2019s parents were born in what was then India, but became resident \ncitizens of Pakistan after the country gained its independence. His mother died in March \n1972. (GE 1.) His father was a high-ranking member of Pakistan\u2019s military (the equivalent \nof a three-star general) before a military coup in 1977, when the new president brought \nhim into Pakistan\u2019s civilian government. He represented a branch of Pakistan\u2019s military in \na civilian capacity and served as a cabinet minister for a succession of different \ndepartments in Pakistan\u2019s government before leaving government service in 1984 or \n1985. (Tr. 45-48, 60.) \nApplicant graduated from high school in Pakistan in 1972. From 1972 to 1973, \nApplicant studied on a scholarship at a technical university in the Middle East. (AE B.) In \nJune 1974, he enlisted in Pakistan\u2019s military so that he could attend an aeronautical \nengineering college funded in part by the U.S. military in Pakistan. (GE 1; Tr. 44.) \nApplicant\u2019s instructor for three electrical engineering courses was a captain in the United \nStates Air Force. He provided a positive reference for Applicant in November 1977, \nattesting that Applicant was a top student, able to think clearly and independently, and \nmotivated to excel in the classroom and in his research activities. He opined that Applicant \nwould be very successful in graduate school. (AE A.) \nAfter Applicant earned his bachelor\u2019s degree in January 1977, he continued \nserving as an officer in Pakistan\u2019s military until March 1980. He had become disillusioned \nafter new military leadership downplayed the importance of engineering within the \nmilitary, and two years after obtaining a transfer out of maintenance engineering, he was \ndischarged from his military obligation. (GE 1; Tr. 43-45.) \nIn August 1980, Applicant came to the United States on a student visa to pursue \nhis master\u2019s degree. (GE 1; Tr. 43.) While he was in college in the United States, his \nfather married a Pakistani resident citizen with three sons. (GE 1; Tr. 34.) Applicant did \nnot develop much of a personal relationship with his stepmother or stepbrothers. He \nvisited with them \u201conce in a while\u201d when he was in Pakistan.

(GE 1; Tr. 50.) Early in September 1981, he married a resident citizen \nof Pakistan in Pakistan. Applicant and his spouse decided to make their home and raise \na family in the United States. Their three children, a son age 37 and daughters ages 35 \nand 26, are U.S. resident citizens from birth. Applicant became a U.S. citizen by \nnaturalization in August 1992. His acquisition of U.S. citizenship served to automatically \nrevoke his citizenship with Pakistan. Applicant\u2019s spouse has U.S. citizenship. The date of \nher naturalization is not in evidence. In July 1996, Applicant and his spouse purchased \ntheir current residence in the United States. (GE 1.) \nApplicant obtained his first U.S. passport in November 1992. He traveled to \nPakistan on his U.S. passport, annually or every other year, to visit his father before his \nfather\u2019s death in 2018. (GE 1; Tr. 34.) During some of his trips to Pakistan, he visited his \nparents-in-law before their deaths, and some extended family members (uncles and a \ncousin) who lived in the same city as his in-laws. (Tr. 51.) \nSince 1985, Applicant has operated his own business as a self-employed \nconsultant in the United States. During his early career, he was involved in industrial \nproduct development that was not defense-related. In June 2004, Applicant became \ninvolved in DOD-applied research as a consultant to a federally-funded development \nlaboratory. He was granted a secret clearance for his duties in July 2005. In August 2012, \nApplicant ended his consultancy because the laboratory wanted him to become a full-\ntime employee rather than pay him as a business. (GE1.) \nIn August 2012, Applicant began working as a contractor for another federally-\nfunded laboratory. On August 31, 2015, Applicant completed and certified as accurate a \nQuestionnaire for National Security Positions to renew his clearance eligibility. He \ndisclosed that, as a U.S. citizen, he holds an identification card issued by the Pakistan \ngovernment to \u201cpeople of Pakistani origin living in the US,\u201d so that he can conduct \nmonetary transactions in Pakistan. He indicated that he had in-person contact with his \nfather in Pakistan to as recently as May 2014. Applicant\u2019s siblings had acquired U.S. \ncitizenship and were living in the United States as of August 2015, while his stepmother \nand two of his three stepbrothers were resident citizens of Pakistan. Applicant indicated \nthat he had monthly contact by telephone or electronic means with his stepmother. He \nhad in-person contact with one stepbrother when he was in Pakistan to as recently as \nApril 2012. He had annual contact with the other stepbrother in Pakistan to as recently as \nAugust 2014. His third stepbrother had acquired U.S. citizenship and was living in the \nUnited States as of August 2015. (GE 1.) \nIn response to an SF 86 inquiry concerning whether he or his spouse had any \nforeign financial interests, Applicant reported that he had received his share of agricultural \nland inherited from his mother. The land was worth about $200,000 when it was sold. He \ndisclosed that he had deposited $15,000 in a bank account in Pakistan from the sale of \nland, and there was $7,000 in the account as of August 2015. He reported on his SF 86 \nthat his spouse had $2,000 in a bank account in Pakistan from the sale of land. She sold \na plot of land in Pakistan worth about $20,000 in March 2010 and used the proceeds to \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \npurchase two plots of land in Pakistan for $60,000 in May 2010. The value of those plots \nhad appreciated to $100,000. Applicant listed among his foreign travels six trips to \nPakistan between April 2008 and September 2014 to visit family or friends. (GE 1.) \nRegarding the sale of the agricultural land that Applicant and his sisters co-\ninherited from their mother, his sisters gave him power of attorney to sell the land. He \nsold the land around May 2011 and deposited $130,000 to $140,000 from the sale into \nhis bank account in Pakistan. After transferring his sisters\u2019 shares to them, he transferred \nabout $80,000 of his share to his bank account in the United States to pay college \nexpenses for his son and older daughter and private high school expenses for his younger \ndaughter. (Tr. 35.) He kept about $15,000 in his U.S. dollar account in the Pakistani bank. \n(Tr. 52-53.) \nApplicant\u2019s father transferred ownership of one of his three properties in Pakistan \nto Applicant in 2016. (Answer.) His father deposited $10,000 to $15,000 into Applicant\u2019s \nbank account in Pakistan to pay for renovations to the property. (Tr. 53.) Applicant rents \nout two units, and his cousin in Pakistan, who is in her 70s and \u201creal estate savvy,\u201d \nhandles the issues involving the property for him. He needs someone in Pakistan to sign \ncontracts on his behalf, and she lives in the same sector as the property, so it is \nconvenient for her to oversee the property. Applicant\u2019s cousin is not affiliated with \nPakistan\u2019s government. (Tr. 36-40.) Applicant indicated in response to the SOR that his \ninteractions with his cousin were \u201cinfrequent.\u201d (Answer.) He testified that he currently \ncontacts his cousin only when repairs are needed to the property or when tenancy \nchanges. (Tr. 55.) Applicant contacted his cousin in mid-to-late November 2021 regarding \nrepairs being made to the premises. (Tr. 56.) \nIn the fall of 2021, Applicant listed his property in Pakistan for sale at an asking \nprice of over $2 million. He is willing to accept its current market value of $2 million. (Tr. \n55.) He believes it will take some time to sell, given it \u201cis a pricey land\u201d in an older sector \nof the city. (Tr. 40.) He has three real estate agents trying to sell the property. (AE L.) Due \nto the current exchange rate of rupees to dollars, continuing to rent it out does not make \neconomic sense, and he has little reason to keep the property, given his immediate family \nand siblings live in the United States. (Tr. 40-41.) Two of Applicant\u2019s children are \nphysicians while the third works as an architect. (Tr. 50.) \nApplicant continues to maintain two bank accounts in Pakistan: an account in \ndollars and an account in Pakistan rupees. Under Pakistan\u2019s laws, rent is required to be\npaid in rupees, even by non-Pakistani tenants. For a short time, his cousin was a signatory\non the rupee account while he was having the premises renovated. He took her off his\nrupee account in Pakistan because she had to disclose the assets on her income tax\nreturns, and it affected her tax rate. (Tr. 54.) Applicant is currently the only signatory to\nhis bank accounts in Pakistan. He maintains the dollars account for the ease of currency\ntransfers out of Pakistan. (Tr. 36.) The balance of that account is currently around $3,000.\n(Tr. 53.) He has about 600,000 rupees (almost $3,400) in the rupees account. (Tr. 53-\n54.) Applicant retains his ID card issued by Pakistan\u2019s government to its former citizens \nso that he can conduct currency transactions in Pakistan. It is not a travel card.

She continues to have a bank account \nin Pakistan, but the account has largely been inactive so the amount on deposit has not \nchanged significantly from 2015.

Applicant has $100,000 in an \nindividual retirement account in the United States. (Tr. 41.) \nApplicant traveled to Pakistan in 2018 on the death of his father. He returned to \nPakistan in early 2019, to settle matters related to his father\u2019s estate. (Tr. 34, 52.) He \nasserts that his settlement of his father\u2019s estate was acrimonious and left no chance of \nhim having any interactions with his stepmother or stepbrothers in the future.

(AE L.) \nAdministrative Notice \nAdministrative notice is not taken of the source documents in their entirety, but of \nspecific facts properly noticed and relevant and material to the issues. I take \nadministrative notice of the facts requested by the Government in HE I and of other facts \nset forth in the source publications from the U.S. State Department, including the updated \nhuman rights report (HE II), bilateral relations fact sheet (HE III), and travel advisory (HE \nIV). Inasmuch as AEs C-I pertain to Pakistan or Pakistani entities and do not involve \nApplicant, relevant facts in those exhibits are also set forth below. \nPakistan is a federal parliamentary republic. Prime Minister Imran Khan assumed \noffice in 2018 after the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaaf (PTI) party took a plurality of seats in \nthe July 2018 general elections. The United States has had diplomatic relations with \nPakistan since the country\u2019s independence in 1947. The United States and Pakistan work \nclosely on a wide array of issues, including efforts to stabilize Afghanistan, \ncounterterrorism, energy, trade, and investment. Pakistan has been designated by the \nUnited States as a major non-NATO ally. (AE C.) The United States, Pakistani, and \nGerman navies conducted a tri-lateral passing exercise on September 6, 2021, to \nstrengthen cooperation and advance a common vision to ensure peace and stability.

(AEs F-G.) Net foreign direct investment in Pakistan jumped to an 11-\nmonth high at $236 million in September 2021. (AE E.) \nPakistan has been engaged in a decades-long armed conflict with militant groups \nthat target government institutions and civilians, including the Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan \n(TTP) and other militant networks. Pakistan has taken actions against externally-focused \nmilitant groups and United Nations-designated terrorist organizations operating within its \nterritory in accord with the country\u2019s National Action Plan against terrorism. However, due \nto Pakistan\u2019s failure to take decisive and irreversible action against these groups, the \nUnited States suspended security assistance to Pakistan in January 2018, with narrow \nexceptions in U.S. national security interests. In January 2019, the U.S. Director of \nNational Intelligence told a Senate panel that Pakistan is recalcitrant to deal with militant \ngroups. It remains a safe haven for numerous Islamist extremist and terrorist groups. \nAlthough the Pakistani government voiced support for political reconciliation between the \nAfghan government and the Afghan Taliban, it did not restrict the Afghan Taliban and \nHaqqani Network from operating in Pakistan and Afghanistan using Pakistan-based safe \nhavens. \nPakistan\u2019s security environment has improved since 2014. Yet Pakistan remains \nat high risk for terrorism. Militants and terrorist groups, including the TTP, Lashkar-e-\nJhangvi, and the Islamic State Khorasan Province targeted civilians, journalists, \ncommunity leaders, security forces, law enforcement officers, and schools, killing and \ninjuring hundreds with bombs, suicide attacks, and other forms of violence in 2020. On \nNovember 15, 2021, the U.S. State Department issued a Level 3 \u2013 Reconsider Travel to \nPakistan due to terrorism and sectarian violence. Terrorist groups continue plotting \nattacks in Pakistan. A local history of terrorism and ongoing ideological aspirations of \nviolence by extremist elements have led to indiscriminate attacks on civilian as well as \nlocal military and police targets. The State Department advises that terrorists may attack \nwith little or no warning, targeting transportation hubs, shopping malls, military \ninstallations, airports, universities, tourist locations, schools, hospitals, places of worship, \nand government facilities. While rare in the capital Islamabad, terrorist acts continue in \nother areas of Pakistan. Large-scale terrorist attacks have resulted in numerous \ncasualties, with most of the attacks occurring in the Balochistan and the Khyber \nPakhtunkhwa (KPK) provinces, including the former Federally Administered Tribal Areas \n(FATA). The current travel warning to these areas is Level 4 \u2013 Do Not Travel due to \nterrorism and kidnapping. The United States has limited ability to provide emergency \nservices to U.S. citizens in Pakistan due to the security environment. Travel by U.S. \ngovernment personnel within Pakistan is restricted. \nPolice have primary domestic security responsibility for most of the country with \nlocal police being under the jurisdiction of provincial governments. Paramilitary \norganizations, including the Frontier Corps which operates in Balochistan and KPK \nprovinces, including the former FATA, and the Rangers, which operate in Sindh and \nPunjab, provide security services under the authority of the Ministry of Interior.

There were numerous reports of fatal \nattacks against police and security forces in Pakistan in 2020. Kidnappings and forced \ndisappearances of persons took place in nearly all areas of the country. There were \nreports of police making arrests to extract bribes. While the law provides for an \nindependent judiciary, the judiciary was often subject to external influences, such as fear \nof reprisal from extremist elements in terrorism or blasphemy cases and public \npoliticization of high-profile cases. \nOther human rights abuses included arbitrary or unlawful government interference \nwith privacy; serious restrictions on free expression, the press, and the Internet, including \nviolence against journalists, censorship, and Internet-site blocking; government \ninterference with the rights of peaceable assembly and freedom of association, including \nof workers; severe restrictions on religious freedom; restrictions on freedom of movement; \ncorruption within the bureaucracy; lack of accountability for gender violence; unlawful \nrecruitment of child soldiers; and the use of the worst forms of child labor. In 2018, 2019, \nand 2020, the U.S. Department of State designated Pakistan as a Country of Particular \nConcern under the 1998 International Freedom Act, as amended, for having engaged in \nor tolerated severe violations of religious freedom. \nThere was a lack of government accountability, and abuses often went \nunpunished, fostering a culture of impunity among perpetrators, whether official or \nunofficial. Authorities seldom punished government officials for human rights abuses in \n2020. Corruption was pervasive in politics and government in 2020. Terrorist violence \nand human rights abuses by non-state actors contributed to human rights problems, \nalthough to a lesser extent than in previous years due to the overall decline in terrorist \nactivity and military, police, and law enforcement campaigns against militant and terrorist \ngroups. Political, sectarian, criminal, and ethnic violence continued in Karachi in 2020. \nPolicies \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion the Executive \nBranch has in regulating access to information pertaining to national security,  \nemphasizing that \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy \nv.

Instead, recognizing the complexities of \nhuman behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the \nadjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overall adjudicative goal is a fair, \nimpartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a \nconscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d \nThe administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the \nperson, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present \nevidence to establish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, \nthe applicant is responsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, \nexplain, extenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department \nCounsel. . . .\u201d The applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable \nsecurity decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation about potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Section 7 of EO 10865 \nprovides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be \na determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section \n3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline B: Foreign Influence \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for foreign influence is articulated in \nAG \u00b6 6: \nForeign contacts and interests, including but not limited to, business, \nfinancial, and property interests, are a national security concern if they result \nin divided allegiance.

Assessment of foreign contacts and \ninterests should consider the country in which the foreign contact or interest \nis located, including, but not limited to, considerations such as whether it is \nknown to target U.S. citizens to obtain classified or sensitive information or \nis associated with a risk of terrorism. \nApplicant\u2019s stepmother, two stepbrothers, and a cousin are resident citizens of \nPakistan. Review of Applicant\u2019s foreign contacts and connections to determine whether \nthey present a heightened risk under AG \u00b6 7(a) or create a potential conflict of interest \nunder AG \u00b6 7(b). Disqualifying conditions AG \u00b6\u00b6 7(a) and 7(b) provide: \n(a) contact, regardless of method, with a foreign family member, business \nor professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or \nresident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of \nforeign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; and \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that\ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual\u2019s obligation to\nprotect classified or sensitive information or technology and the individual\u2019s\ndesire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing that\ninformation or technology. \n \n \n \n \nNot every foreign contact or tie presents the heightened risk under AG \u00b6 7(a). The \n\u201cheightened risk\u201d denotes a risk greater than the normal risk inherent in having a family \nmember living under a foreign government. The nature and strength of the familial ties \nand the country involved (i.e., the nature of its government, its relationship with the United \nStates, and its human rights record) are relevant in assessing whether there is a likelihood \nof vulnerability to coercion. The risk of coercion, persuasion, or duress is significantly \ngreater if the foreign country has an authoritarian government; a close friend or family \nmember is associated with, or dependent on, the foreign government; or the country is \nknown to conduct intelligence operations against the United States. In considering the \nnature of the foreign government, the administrative judge must take into account any \nterrorist activity in the country at issue. See generally ISCR Case No. 02-26130 at 3 (App. \nBd. Dec. 7, 2006). \nPakistan is a major non-NATO ally of the United States. The United States and \nPakistan work closely on a wide array of issues, including efforts to stabilize Afghanistan, \ncounterterrorism, energy, trade, and investment. The United States is one of the largest \nsources of foreign direct investment in Pakistan, and remains Pakistan\u2019s largest export \nmarket. Guideline B concerns are not limited to countries hostile to the United States. \nEven friendly nations may have interests that are not completely aligned with the United \nStates.

Due to Pakistan\u2019s \nfailure to take decisive and irreversible action against externally-focused militant groups \nand United Nations-designated terrorist organizations operating within its territory, the \nUnited States suspended security assistance to Pakistan in January 2018, with narrow \nexceptions in U.S. national security interests. In January 2019, the U.S. Director of \nNational Intelligence told a Senate panel that Pakistan is recalcitrant to deal with militant \ngroups. It remains a safe haven for numerous Islamist extremist and terrorist groups. \nAlthough the Pakistani government voiced support for political reconciliation between the \nAfghan government and the Afghan Taliban, it did not restrict the Afghan Taliban and \nHaqqani Network from operating in Pakistan and Afghanistan using Pakistan-based safe \nhavens. \nPakistan was not reported to conduct intelligence operations against the United \nStates. However, Pakistan has serious human rights problems and is at significant risk of \nterrorist activity within its borders. The risk of terrorism in Pakistan has led the U.S. State \nDepartment to continue to advise travelers to exercise increased caution when in the \ncountry and to not travel to certain areas of Pakistan. \nApplicant had limited contact over the years with his stepmother and stepbrothers \nin Pakistan. Applicant\u2019s father remarried after Applicant came to the United States, and \nApplicant did not establish strong bonds of affection or obligation to his stepmother or her \nsons. As of his August 2015 SF 86, Applicant reportedly had monthly contact with his \nstepmother; only in-person contact with one stepbrother, which occurred less than \nannually; and annual in-person contact with the other stepbrother in Pakistan. Following \nthe acrimonious distribution of his father\u2019s estate in 2019, he has no ongoing contact with \nthem. Applicant does not appear to be at heightened risk of undue foreign influence \nbecause of his stepmother and stepbrothers\u2019 residency and citizenship in Pakistan. \nApplicant\u2019s connections to his step-relatives are not seen as creating a potential conflict \nof interest. There is no indication that Applicant would jeopardize classified information to \nprotect them. \nApplicant did not elaborate about his personal relationship with his cousin in \nPakistan. He did not list her as a foreign contact on his SF 86 and stated in response to \nthe SOR that he has \u201cinfrequent interactions with her.\u201d What is known is that he relies on \nhis cousin to oversee and maintain his real estate in Pakistan. He has given his cousin \nauthority to execute contracts on his behalf regarding repairs and rental issues in \nPakistan. After ownership of the house was transferred to Applicant in 2016, his cousin \nwas a signatory to his rupee account in Pakistan, although he has since had her removed \nbecause of the tax problems it was causing her. Applicant called his cousin a week or so \nbefore his December 2021 hearing because repairs were being made to his property in \nPakistan. It is unclear whether Applicant would maintain a relationship with his cousin or \nhave more than casual contact with her were it not for his house. Because his contact \nwith her centers on his property, the evaluation of the risk of undue foreign influence or \nof a potential conflict of interest with respect to his cousin depends largely on whether his \n12 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \nforeign financial and property interests present a heightened risk under AG \u00b6 7(f), which \nprovides: \n(f) substantial business, financial, or property interests in a foreign country, \nor in any foreign owned or foreign-operated business that could subject the \nindividual to a heightened risk of foreign influence or exploitation or personal \nconflict of interest. \nApplicant recently listed his house in Pakistan for sale for more than $2 million. He \nwas not more specific about the asking price, but indicated that he would accept $2 \nmillion, the current market value of his foreign property. His spouse owns two plots of \nland, whose market value has appreciated to between $250,000 and $300,000. Applicant \nasserts that his and his spouse\u2019s foreign assets are \u201cnot important to their overall financial \nsituation.\u201d This appears to be so with respect to their bank assets in Pakistan. Applicant \nhas two bank accounts in Pakistan with about $6,400 in total deposits. His spouse has \nabout $2,000 on deposit in a bank account in Pakistan. These assets are minimal. \nHowever, their real estate interests implicate AG \u00b6 7(f). They are of substantial value, and \nit is conceivable that Applicant\u2019s activities on behalf of the United States could come to \nthe attention of someone seeking U.S. sensitive information. It is foreseeable that these \ninterests could be a means through which Applicant could be subjected to foreign \ninfluence. Applicant\u2019s property was once owned by his father, who held prominent \npositions in Pakistan\u2019s military and government in the past. The fact that his father left \ngovernment service in 1984 or 1985 lessens the concern somewhat, but his father\u2019s \nservice is a matter of historical record. Furthermore, Applicant\u2019s ownership of the property \nis a matter of official record in Pakistan. Applicant maintains an ID card issued by the \ngovernment of Pakistan so that he can conduct financial transactions in Pakistan. While \nhe does so because it is required by Pakistan\u2019s laws and not because he seeks to \nmaintain official recognition of his Pakistani origin, the ID card is a means through which \nhe could come to the attention of persons in Pakistan interested in obtaining protected \nU.S. information. As long as Applicant owns the property, he can be expected to contact \nhis cousin and rely on her to deal with it for him. AGs \u00b6 7(a), 7(b), and 7(e) are established. \nThe following four mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 8 warrant some discussion in \nthis case: \n(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in which \nthese persons are located, or the positions or activities of those persons in \nthat country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be placed in a \nposition of having to choose between the interests of a foreign individual, \ngroup, organization, or government and the interests of the United States; \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of \nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, or allegiance to the group, \ngovernment, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such deep and \nlongstanding relationships and loyalties in the United States, that the \n13 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nindividual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the \nU.S. interest; \n(c) contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and \ninfrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign \ninfluence or exploitation; and \n(f) the value or routine nature of the foreign business, financial, or property \ninterests is such that they are unlikely to result in a conflict and could not be \nused effectively to influence, manipulate, or pressure the individual. \nConcerning AG \u00b6 8(a), although Pakistan has been designated as a major non-\nNATO ally by the United States, Pakistan has not always acted in U.S. interests, as \nevidenced by its failure to restrict the Afghan Taliban and Haqqani Network from operating \nin Pakistan in Pakistan-based safe havens. Pakistan remains at serious risk of terrorist \nactivity throughout its borders, and the country has a problematic human rights record. \nThere is a lack of government accountability, and abuses often go unpunished, fostering \na culture of impunity among perpetrators, whether official or unofficial. AG \u00b6 8(a) does not \napply. \nIn evaluating whether Applicant has \u201csuch deep and longstanding relationships \nand loyalties in the United States\u201d to trigger AG \u00b6 8(b) in mitigation, it is noted that \nApplicant has not exhibited or expressed any preference for Pakistan over the United \nStates. He served as an officer in Pakistan\u2019s military decades ago, but primarily because \nhe wanted to pursue his engineering degree at a college funded in part by the U.S. \nmilitary. Some of his instructors were active duty members of the United States military. \nApplicant earned his master\u2019s degree in the United States. He and his spouse, both \nnatives of Pakistan, chose to make their permanent home in the United States. They \nbecame naturalized U.S. citizens, and their three children were born and educated in the \nUnited States. \nApplicant has operated his own consulting business in the United States since \nabout 1984. In June 2004, he began contributing to the U.S. defense effort as a contractor \nto a federally-funded laboratory. He worked there with a secret security clearance until \nAugust 2012, when he resigned because the company no longer wanted to pay him as a \nbusiness. Since then, he has worked as a contractor at another laboratory with DOD \ncontracts, and maintained his security clearance eligibility. \nIn addition to his work income, Applicant has about $100,000 in an individual \nretirement account in the United States. He and his spouse own their home, which they \npurchased around July 1996. They have about $1 million in equity in the property, which \nhas a current value of approximately $1.5 million. There is no indication that Applicant \nplans to return to Pakistan to live. The home gifted to him by his father is up for sale. His \nfamily ties to Pakistan at this point are limited to the cousin overseeing his property for \nhim. Applicant\u2019s spouse, children, and sisters are all resident citizens of the United States. \nWith the death of his father in 2018 and the settlement of his father\u2019s estate in 2019, \n14 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant does not currently have any plans to travel to Pakistan in the future. AG \u00b6 8(b) \nhas some applicability. \nAG \u00b6 8(c) is established in mitigation of the contacts he had with his stepmother \nand stepbrothers when he was in contact with them. While his communications with his \ncousin may be infrequent, they cannot fairly be deemed casual because they involve his \nsubstantial property asset in Pakistan. AG \u00b6 8(c) does not apply to his contacts with his \ncousin. \nAG \u00b6 8(f) applies to Applicant\u2019s and his spouse\u2019s bank deposits in Pakistan which \ntotal less than $10,000. However, the value of their real estate assets in Pakistan is \nconsiderable, even when compared to their U.S. interests. Applicant and his spouse have \nabout $1 million in equity in their home in the United States. Apart from a $100,000 \nindividual retirement account, Applicant did indicate that he holds other assets. I cannot \nspeculate as to the extent of any savings or checking assets in the United States. \nApplicant also provided no details about his current income, either from his work in the \nUnited States or from his rented-out units in Pakistan. He testified that it makes no \neconomic sense to continue to rent out the property in Pakistan. In the fall of 2021, he \nplaced the property on the market at an asking price of more than $2 million. His spouse \nis not interested in selling her two plots of land now worth between $250,000 and \n$300,000. \nIn some sense, these foreign real estate assets can be considered routine. There \nis no indication that Applicant has any sentimental tie to the home that his father had \ngifted him in 2016. At present, Applicant is not willing to accept less than the market value \nof $2 million for his house in Pakistan. Applicant acquired the property from his father in \n2016, so after he completed his August 2015 SF 86, which placed him on notice that the \nDOD was concerned about foreign financial assets. There is no evidence that he tried to \nsell the property at that time. Instead, with his cousin\u2019s assistance, he had the property \nrenovated into two rental units and obtained tenants. He listed the house for sale only \nrecently, in the fall of 2021. He put the house on the market well after he received the \nSOR in January 2020. His actions do not suggest that the asset is of no or minimal \nimportance to him. AG \u00b6 8(f) does not apply to his and his spouse\u2019s foreign real estate \nassets. As long as Applicant continues to retain ownership of the house, he is likely to \nhave ongoing contact with his cousin. The foreign influence security concerns are only \npartially mitigated. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of his conduct and \nall relevant circumstances in light of the nine adjudicative process factors in AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \n15 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation\nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct;\n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the\nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), \u201c[t]he ultimate determination of whether the granting or continuing \nof national security clearance eligibility is clearly consistent with the interests of national \nsecurity must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the [pertinent] guidelines\u201d and the whole-person concept. My comments under \nGuideline B are incorporated in my whole-person analysis. \nA guideline B adjudication is not a judgment on an applicant\u2019s character or loyalty \nto the United States. It is a determination as to whether an applicant\u2019s circumstances \nforeseeably present a security risk. See e.g., ISCR Case No. 19-00831 at 5 (App. Bd. \nJuly 29, 2020). Applicant has not shown any disloyalty to the United States. He is a person \nof good character. His efforts to maintain contact with his father and to visit him annually \nor every other year show family loyalty, which is a positive character trait. Yet, his \ncircumstances, as detailed above, are such that he could be placed in an untenable \nposition of having to choose between competing interests. \nApplicant has held a DOD secret clearance since approximately July 2005. There \nis no evidence that he has failed to comply with any security practices or procedures. \nThat information weighs in his favor. At the same time, it does not compel the continuation \nof security clearance eligibility. The Appeal Board reiterated in ISCR 17-04278 that \n\u201c[e]ven those persons with good security records can encounter circumstances in which \nthey could be subjected to pressure for find themselves in a conflict between their own \nlegitimate interests and the security interests of the U.S.\u201d It is well settled that once a \nconcern arises regarding an applicant\u2019s security clearance eligibility, there is a strong \npresumption against the grant or renewal of a security clearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, \n913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th Cir. 1990). Based on the evidence of record, it is not clearly \nconsistent with the interests of national security to grant or continue security clearance \neligibility for Applicant at this time. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the amended \nSOR, as required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline B:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.b: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.c: \nWithdrawn \nSubparagraphs 1.d-1.e: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.f: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.g: \nAgainst Applicant \n16 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_______________________ \nSubparagraph 1.h: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.i: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant or continue eligibility for \na security clearance for Applicant.

(Tr2. 6) He married in 1998 and divorced in June 2006. (AE L) He has a \nson, age 21, and a daughter, age 17. (Tr2. 8, AE J) \nApplicant\u2019s employment history shows he worked as a systems engineer between \nSeptember 2001 and January 2009, making approximately $103,000 a year. He was \nunemployed between February 2009 and August 2010. He was self-employed as a \nhandyman between September 2010 and August 2011, while seeking full-time \nemployment.

He established that \nhe had been in contact with his creditors and was making payments on some of his \ndelinquent accounts. An investigator with the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) \ninterviewed Applicant in December 2018, and he discussed the accounts alleged in the \nSOR and other accounts that were not alleged because he had resolved them. \nApplicant explained that his financial problems resulted from a combination of \nfactors, including his 2006 divorce, and two unemployment periods. After his divorce, he \nwas required to provide alimony for his ex-wife, child support for two children, and for the \nfinancial support of two households. The additional expenses strained his financial \nsituation. He was laid off from his job and was unemployed between February 2009 and \nAugust 2010. He worked as a handyman between September 2010 and August 2011, \nwhile seeking full-time employment. \nApplicant\u2019s financial problems and the four debs alleged in the SOR resulted from \nthis period of unemployment and underemployment. He used his credit to pay for his \nmortgage, car note, and family\u2019s living expenses. He was the sole source of income and \nhis income was insufficient to pay the delinquent accounts and their living expenses. After \nhe found employment, he took some time to get his financial situation stable. He then \ncontacted his creditors and tried to pay his delinquent debts, but the interest charges were \nso high that he had difficulty paying off the debs. \nApplicant was laid off and unemployed again between February 2017 and \nDecember 2017. He stated that he learned his lesson from his first period of \nunemployment, and he avoided acquiring any additional delinquent debts during his \nsecond unemployment period. He went into a cash only expense policy where if he did \nnot have the cash to pay for something he would not buy it. He has continued with this \ncash only policy to present. He believes that because of his stable employment and \ncurrent financial situation he will not have the same financial problems in the future. In \nApril 2022, he participated in online financial counseling. (AE 1, Tab M) \nApplicant\u2019s priority has always been to take care of his children\u2019s needs first and \nthen to pay his home mortgage and other secured obligations. Applicant highlighted that \nbecause of his good financial practices he was able to pay off his mortgage and a car \nnote. \nWhen Applicant contacted the creditor of the account alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.a to try \nto settle or establish a payment plan, the creditor offered him a cancellation of debt on \nDecember 31, 2019. (AE A; Tr. 20-21) Concerning the accounts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b \nand 1.d, he submitted documentary evidence showing that he had settled and paid both \naccounts. (AE B and AE C) \nSOR \u00b6 1.c alleged a 2015, $12,583 judgment entered against Applicant. \nApparently, he was wrongfully advised not pay it and to let it fall off his credit report, but \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nafter understanding the consequences, he considered it a bad idea. He contacted the \ncreditor several times to try to settle or establish a payment plan, with no results. The \ncreditor did not want to settle for less than owed. At hearing, Applicant testified that he \nhad made four payments on this account and reduced it to about $10,500. He made one \npayment in June 2017, apparently while trying to establish a payment plan. He made one \npayment in March 2022 and two in April 2022. Post-hearing, Applicant submitted \ndocumentary evidence showing he paid $1,800 in May 2022, and his current balance is \n$8,719. (AE 1, Tab N) \nConcerning his current financial situation, Applicant believes it is very stable and \nhe lives comfortably within his means. He has been working diligently to bring his financial \nsituation under control. He is able and willing to pay his delinquent debts and promised \nto be financially responsible in the future. He is confident that he will be able to resolve \nany future financial problems. He has a savings account with about $4,000, checking \naccount with close to $2,000, and his 401k retirement account has close to $400,000. (Tr. \n39-40) \nAt hearing, Applicant acknowledged he owed property taxes on his home. He \ntestified he intended to pay his delinquent property taxes after his hearing. Documentary \nevidence submitted post-hearing shows he paid the property tax owed ($9,832) in May \n2022. (AE 1, Tab P) I find that Applicant was candid and forthcoming during the clearance \nprocess. He revealed his financial problems in his 2018 SCA, and discussed his financial \nproblems during his interview and at his hearing. \nPolicies \nThe SOR was issued under Executive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information Within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (Directive) \n(January 2, 1992), as amended; and the National Security Adjudicative Guidelines for \nDetermining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information or Eligibility to Hold a Sensitive \nPosition (AGs), applicable to all adjudicative decisions issued on or after June 8, 2017. \nEligibility for access to classified information may be granted \u201conly upon a finding \nthat it is clearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended. The \nU.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the Executive Branch in \nregulating access to information pertaining to national security, emphasizing that \u201cno one \nhas a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 \n(1988). \nThe AGs list disqualifying and mitigating conditions for evaluating a person\u2019s \nsuitability for access to classified information. Any one disqualifying or mitigating condition \nis not, by itself, conclusive. However, the AGs should be followed where a case can be \nmeasured against them, as they represent policy guidance governing access to classified \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ninformation. Each decision must reflect a fair, impartial, and commonsense consideration \nof the whole person and the factors listed in Security Executive Agent Directive (SEAD) \n4, App. A \u00b6\u00b6 2(d) and 2(f). All available, reliable information about the person, past and \npresent, favorable and unfavorable, must be considered. [First time SEAD used] \nSecurity clearance decisions resolve whether it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant or continue an applicant\u2019s security clearance. The Government \nmust prove, by substantial evidence, controverted facts alleged in the SOR. If it does, the \nburden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts. The \napplicant bears the heavy burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant or continue his or her security clearance. \nPersons with access to classified information enter into a fiduciary relationship with \nthe Government based on trust and confidence. Thus, the Government has a compelling \ninterest in ensuring each applicant possesses the requisite judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness of those who must protect national interest as their own. The \u201cclearly \nconsistent with the national interest\u201d standard compels resolution of any reasonable doubt \nabout an applicant\u2019s suitability for access in favor of the Government. \u201c[S]ecurity \nclearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. \nat 531; SEAD 4, \u00b6 E(4); SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6\u00b6 1(d) and 2(b). Clearance decisions are not \na determination of the loyalty of the applicant concerned. They are merely an indication \nthat the applicant has or has not met the strict guidelines the Government has established \nfor issuing a clearance. \nAnalysis \nFinancial Considerations \nAG \u00b6 18 articulates the security concern relating to financial problems:  \nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to\nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be\ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental\nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds . . ..  \n \n \n \n \nThe Appeal Board explained the scope and rationale for the financial \nconsiderations security concern in ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012) \n(citation omitted) as follows: \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an applicant might \nknowingly compromise classified information in order to raise money in \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nsatisfaction of his or her debts. Rather, it requires a Judge to examine the \ntotality of an applicant\u2019s financial history and circumstances. The Judge \nmust consider pertinent evidence regarding the applicant\u2019s self-control, \njudgment, and other qualities essential to protecting the national secrets as \nwell as the vulnerabilities inherent in the circumstances. The Directive \npresumes a nexus between proven conduct under any of the Guidelines \nand an applicant\u2019s security eligibility.  \nApplicant\u2019s financial problems are documented in the record. He accumulated four \ndelinquent debts that were placed for collection. AG \u00b6 19 provides disqualifying conditions \nthat could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying in this case: \u201c(a) inability to \nsatisfy debts;\u201d and \u201c(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations.\u201d The record \nestablished these disqualifying conditions, requiring additional inquiry about the possible \napplicability of mitigating conditions. \nThe following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control;  \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts;  \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue; and \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority \nto file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \nThe DOHA Appeal Board concisely explained Applicant\u2019s responsibility for proving \nthe applicability of mitigating conditions as follows: \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nOnce a concern arises regarding an Applicant\u2019s security clearance \neligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance of \na security clearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th \nCir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991). After the Government \npresents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the \napplicant to rebut or mitigate those concerns. See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. The \nstandard applicable in security clearance decisions is that articulated in \nEgan, supra. \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access \nto classified information will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nDirective, Enclosure 2 \u00b6 2(b). \nISCR Case No. 10-04641 at 4 (App. Bd. Sept. 24, 2013). \nApplicant resolved three of the delinquent accounts alleged in the SOR; two were \nresolved before the SOR was issued (\u00b6\u00b6 1.a and b). He recently established a payment \nplan with the creditor of the account alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.c. Applicant attributed his financial \nproblems to his divorce and his two periods of unemployment and underemployment. \nThese factors are circumstances beyond his control that adversely affected or aggravated \nhis financial situation. \nAs the DOHA Appeal Board has noted in the past, a clearance adjudication is not \ndirected at collecting debts. Rather, it is a proceeding aimed at evaluating an applicant\u2019s \njudgment and reliability. On balance, when considered in light of the record as a whole, I \nfind that the evidence is sufficient to establish that Applicant was financially responsible \nunder the circumstances. \nApplicant started addressing some of his delinquent accounts before the issuance \nof the SOR. He considered not paying one of the accounts when the creditor refused to \nsettle for less than the amount owed. He sought out financial counseling, legal advice, \nand communicated with his creditors. He established payment plans, and he complied \nwith the promises he made to make payments. In doing so, Applicant has demonstrated \nsome financial responsibility. \nThe record evidence shows that Applicant does not has a problem complying with \ngovernment rules, regulations, and systems. His evidence is sufficient to establish \nmitigation of the financial considerations security concerns. Applicant acted responsibly \nunder the circumstances, and he made a good-faith effort to resolve his financial \nproblems. Applicant\u2019s financial issues are being resolved and they do not cast doubt on \nhis current reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. Because of the clearance \nprocess, Applicant fully understands he is required to maintain financial responsibility to \nbe eligible for a clearance. This is his first clearance application. I believe he will be \nfinancially responsible in the future. \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n         \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n____________________________ \nWhole-Person Concept \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case, and under the whole-person concept. \nSEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6\u00b6 2(a) and 2(d). Under AG \u00b6 2(c), \u201c[t]he ultimate determination\u201d of \nwhether to grant a security clearance \u201cmust be an overall commonsense judgment based \nupon careful consideration of the guidelines\u201d and the whole-person concept. My \ncomments under Guideline F are incorporated in my whole-person analysis. Some of the \nfactors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were addressed under that guideline but some warrant additional \ncomment. \nApplicant, 61, receives favorable credit for his work for a federal contractor. He \nalso receives favorable credit for resolving three of the accounts alleged in the SOR. He \nshould have been more diligent addressing his delinquent accounts. However, he made \ngood-faith efforts to correct his mistakes. He credibly stated that he will pay the remaining \ndebt listed on the SOR. Financial considerations security concerns are mitigated. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a - 1.d:  \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly \nconsistent with the national security interests of the United States to grant or continue \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings and exhibits submitted, I make the following findings of fact: Applicant is 47 years old, married twice and divorced twice. The most recent divorce was in October 2016. He has two adult stepsons and one adult son. He enlisted in the United States Marine Corps and served on active duty from September 1994 until his honorable discharge in April 2002. From July 2003 to August 2004, he attended a technical school. Due to a lay-off, he was unemployed from October 2016 until May 2017. His 2016 divorce, which led to alimony and child support obligations, also contributed to his financial problems. (Item 3.) Since May 2017, he has been employed by a defense contractor that is also his sponsor. (Item 3; Response.) Neither the Government nor Applicant offered any explanation for the nearly two-year delay between the issuance of the SOR and Applicant\u2019s Answer. The Government did not object to Applicant\u2019s delay in Answering the SOR. In Applicant\u2019s Response, he submitted documents from a credit repair agency showing that two unalleged debts had been paid in full. The first debt stated no amount. The second debt was settled for $587 on a balance due of $1,467. Those resolutions were accomplished in February and March 2021, respectively. (Response.) The SOR alleged five delinquent debts either charged off or in collection totaling $56,452. (Item 1.) All five of the SOR debts are supported by the December 15, 2018 credit r",

Or.) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry \n1960), as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security \nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and Security \nExecutive Agent Directive 4, National Security Adjudicative Guidelines, effective within \nthe DOD as of June 8, 2017. \nOn January 19, 2022, Applicant submitted an answer to the SOR (Answer) and \nelected a decision on the written record by an administrative judge of the Defense Office \nof Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) in lieu of a hearing.

DOHA sent the FORM to Applicant on March \n29, 2022, who received the FORM on April 19, 2022. He was afforded 30 days after \nreceiving the FORM to file objections and submit material in refutation, extenuation, or \nmitigation. He responded to the FORM on May 9, 2022 (Response), to which the \nGovernment did not object.  The SOR and the Answer (Items 1 and 2) are the pleadings \nin the case. Items 3 through 5 and the Response are admitted without objection. The case \nwas assigned to me on July 21, 2022.  \nFindings of Fact \nAfter a thorough and careful review of the pleadings and exhibits submitted, I make \nthe following findings of fact: \nApplicant is 47 years old, married twice and divorced twice. The most recent \ndivorce was in October 2016. He has two adult stepsons and one adult son. He enlisted \nin the United States Marine Corps and served on active duty from September 1994 until \nhis honorable discharge in April 2002. From July 2003 to August 2004, he attended a \ntechnical school. Due to a lay-off, he was unemployed from October 2016 until May 2017. \nHis 2016 divorce, which led to alimony and child support obligations, also contributed to \nhis financial problems. (Item 3.) Since May 2017, he has been employed by a defense \ncontractor that is also his sponsor. (Item 3; Response.) Neither the Government nor \nApplicant offered any explanation for the nearly two-year delay between the issuance of \nthe SOR and Applicant\u2019s Answer. The Government did not object to Applicant\u2019s delay in \nAnswering the SOR. \nIn Applicant\u2019s Response, he submitted documents from a credit repair agency \nshowing that two unalleged debts had been paid in full. The first debt stated no amount. \nThe second debt was settled for $587 on a balance due of $1,467. Those resolutions \nwere accomplished in February and March 2021, respectively. (Response.) \nThe SOR alleged five delinquent debts either charged off or in collection totaling \n$56,452. (Item 1.) All five of the SOR debts are supported by the December 15, 2018 \ncredit report. (Item 4.). Only SOR \u00b6 1.d. appears on the March 7, 2022 credit report, which \nis the most recent report. The other four SOR debts are not reported on the most recent \nreport. (Item 5.) Applicant admitted all allegations, with brief comments that are discussed \nbelow. (Item 2.) \nSOR \u00b6 1.a. is an account in collection for $116. (Item 1.) Applicant\u2019s admission \nstated: \u201cAccount has been satisfied.\u201d (Item 2.) He provided a cancelled check showing he \npaid this in full. (Response.) This debt has been resolved. \nSOR \u00b6 1.b. is an account in collection for $4,024. (Item 1.) This account was in \ndispute. (Item 4.) Applicant\u2019s admission stated: \u201cAccount has been satisfied.\u201d (Item 2.) \nApplicant\u2019s credit repair agency\u2019s document indicates that he did not pay the debt, rather \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n          \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n        \n \n \nthe debt was successfully disputed on the basis that the collection agency was unable to \nverify the account.

Applicant submitted a document that shows \nthis account was paid in full ($282) in September 2020. (Response.) This debt has been \nresolved. \nSOR \u00b6 1.d. is an account charged off for $51,825. (Item 1.) Applicant\u2019s admission \nstated: \u201cAccount amount has been lowered.\u201d (Item 2.) Applicant submitted a March 3, \n2021 document from his credit repair agency that the creditor agreed to \u201cadjust account \nbalance.\u201d (Response.) The most recent credit report confirms a reduced balance of \n$41,876. (Item 5.) He stated: \u201cThe only thing I have not paid is [Bank D] and that is do \n[sic] to them writing the debt off.\u201d This debt\u2019s balance has been reduced by $9,949. \nSOR \u00b6 1.e. is an account in collection for $205. (Item 1.) Applicant\u2019s admission \nstated: \u201cAccount has been satisfied.\u201d (Item 2.) Applicant submitted a May 5, 2022 \ndocument that shows the account settled for less than full balance ($151). (Response.) \nThis debt has been resolved. \nFour of the five SOR debts went into collections between August 2016 and October \n2017 and the fifth joining in December 2018. (Item 4.) \nLaw and Policies \nIt is well established that no one has a right to a security clearance. As the \nSupreme Court held, \u201cthe clearly consistent standard indicates that security \ndeterminations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Department of the Navy \nv. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988). \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, an \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are \nflexible rules of law that apply together with common sense and the general factors of the \nwhole-person concept. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. The protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 \n\u00b62(b) requires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national \nsecurity eligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \n \n Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, then the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion in seeking a favorable security decision.  \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe security concern relating to Guideline F for financial considerations is set out \nin AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds.  \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an individual might knowingly \ncompromise classified information in order to raise money. It encompasses concerns \nabout an individual\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting \nclassified information. An individual who is financially irresponsible may also be \nirresponsible, unconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified \ninformation. ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \nGuideline F notes conditions that could raise security concerns under AG \u00b6 19. \nThe following conditions are applicable in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations.  \nThe SOR debts are established by Applicant\u2019s admissions and the Government\u2019s \ncredit reports. AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and 19(c) apply. \nGuideline F also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising \nfrom financial difficulties. The following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially \napplicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and, \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt . . . and provides evidence of actions to resolve the issue.  \nThe next inquiry is whether any mitigating conditions apply. At the outset, the \nAppeals Board has consistently held that an applicant is not required to resolve every \ndebt alleged in the SOR. Nor is there a requirement that SOR debts be resolved first. An \napplicant need only show by his actions his efforts to resolve debts. See, e.g., ISCR Case \nNo. 07-06482 at 2-3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008). \nApplicant\u2019s SOR debts occurred between 2016 and 2018. That is not so long ago. \nNor were those debts infrequent. Because of the frequency and recency of the debts, AG \n\u00b6 20(a) does not mitigate his debts. \nMost of Applicant\u2019s financial problems had their inception between 2016 and 2018, \nwhich coincided with a number of unfortunate developments in his personal and \nprofessional life. In October 2016, he was laid off. The ensuing unemployment lasted until \nMay 2017. His divorce led to obligations for alimony and child support. Those are \nconditions \u201clargely beyond [his] control,\u201d within the contemplation of AG \u00b6 20(b). That \ndoes not, however, end the inquiry. \nAG \u00b6 20(b) requires that Applicant act \u201cresponsibly\u201d under the adverse \ncircumstances he confronted. In this case, he retained a credit repair agency. The record \nshows that the agency was instrumental in resolving SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b. (a successful dispute). \nIn addition, the agency had Applicant\u2019s largest creditor (SOR \u00b6 1.d.) reduce the balance \ndue by almost $10,000 (from $51,825). The record suggests that Applicant was unable \nto pay this latter debt, because it had been charged off. The law does not require the \ndoing of futile acts. Ohio v. Roberts, U.S. 56 (1980). I find that AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(b) and (e) apply. \nThe record shows Applicant\u2019s pattern of resolving his SOR debts. He paid or \nsettled SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a., c., and e. Plus, he resolved two unalleged debts. AG \u00b6 20(d) applies.  \nThe Whole-Person Concept \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(a), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. AG \u00b6\u00b6 2(a) and (d)(1)-(9) \n(explaining the \u201cwhole-person\u201d concept and factors). In my analysis, I considered the \npotentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions and the whole-person concept in light \nof all the facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have also considered favorably \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n          \n \n \nthat Applicant volunteered two unalleged debts that he resolved.  See ISCR Case No. 03-\n20327 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, 2006). \nApplicant leaves me with no questions about his eligibility and suitability for a \nsecurity clearance. Therefore, I conclude that Applicant has provided sufficient evidence \nto mitigate the security concerns arising under Guideline F, financial considerations. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \n      Subparagraphs 1.a. \u2013 1.e.:  \n \n \n         \nFOR APPLICANT \n For Applicant \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n     Conclusion \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented, it is clearly consistent with the \ninterests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for access to classified \ninformation.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact In Applicant\u2019s original answer to the SOR, he admitted the allegation in SOR \u00b6 1.a and denied the allegation in SOR \u00b6 1.b. In his amended answer to the SOR, he did not expressly admit or deny SOR \u00b6 2.a, but he argued that it was irrelevant. I have treated his response to SOR \u00b6 2.a as a denial. Applicant\u2019s admissions in his answer and at the hearing are incorporated in my findings of fact. Applicant is a 38-year-old business intelligence developer employed by a defense contractor since June 2018. He worked for a home-improvement store for about six months before being hired by his current employer. He has never held a security clearance. He has never married and has no children. His father is a retired Navy veteran. His father and brother are both disabled, and he takes care of them. (Tr. 2 at 16, 119.) In March 2001, Applicant, then 17 years old, was employed at a gas station located on a military installation. Because the amount of the money in the cash register did not match the amount of gas that was sold, an investigation was initiated. There was a cash shortage of $20.87 on March 30, 2001, and a surveillance camera was installed in the office, which captured a video of Applicant taking money from the cash register. He was accused of embezzling about $200 by ringing a \u201cno sale\u201d on the cash register on several 2 occasions and keeping the cash. At the hearing, he admitted taking money from the cash register, but stated that he needed exact change for bus fa",

Applicant submitted an amended \nanswer to the SOR and a motion to strike or deny Department Counsel\u2019s motion to amend \nthe SOR. I granted Department Counsel\u2019s motions to amend the SOR and submit \nadditional evidence. (Hearing Exhibit (HX) II.) I denied Applicant\u2019s motion. \nDepartment Counsel submitted GX 6 through 12, which were admitted without \nobjection. Applicant testified and submitted AX B and C, which were admitted without \nobjection. The record closed at the conclusion of the hearing. DOHA received the \ntranscript of the February 7 session (Tr. 2) on February 15, 2022. \nFindings of Fact \nIn Applicant\u2019s original answer to the SOR, he admitted the allegation in SOR \u00b6 1.a \nand denied the allegation in SOR \u00b6 1.b. In his amended answer to the SOR, he did not \nexpressly admit or deny SOR \u00b6 2.a, but he argued that it was irrelevant. I have treated \nhis response to SOR \u00b6 2.a as a denial. Applicant\u2019s admissions in his answer and at the \nhearing are incorporated in my findings of fact. \nApplicant is a 38-year-old business intelligence developer employed by a defense \ncontractor since June 2018. He worked for a home-improvement store for about six \nmonths before being hired by his current employer. He has never held a security \nclearance. He has never married and has no children. His father is a retired Navy veteran. \nHis father and brother are both disabled, and he takes care of them. (Tr. 2 at 16, 119.) \nIn March 2001, Applicant, then 17 years old, was employed at a gas station located \non a military installation. Because the amount of the money in the cash register did not \nmatch the amount of gas that was sold, an investigation was initiated. There was a cash \nshortage of $20.87 on March 30, 2001, and a surveillance camera was installed in the \noffice, which captured a video of Applicant taking money from the cash register. He was \naccused of embezzling about $200 by ringing a \u201cno sale\u201d on the cash register on several \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \noccasions and keeping the cash. At the hearing, he admitted taking money from the cash \nregister, but stated that he needed exact change for bus fare and sometimes exchanged \nhis money for smaller bills or change in the cash register. (Tr. 2 at 14-15.) \nAt the hearing, Applicant testified that he believed the cash shortage at the gas \nstation occurred because employees programmed the gas pumps incorrectly so that a \n$1.97 transaction was registered as 19 cents. He believed that the programming error \ncaused the loss of about $3,000 and triggered the investigation. (Tr. 2 at 99.) He testified \nthat, after the investigation, the loss-prevention supervisor concluded that there was no \nembezzlement, and no further action was taken. (Tr. 2 at 14-16.) The incident report \nreflects that Applicant was turned over to his mother, but it does not reflect any legal or \nadministrative actions taken against him. (GX 3.) This incident was the basis for SOR \u00b6 \n1.b. The juvenile court records of the jurisdiction where Applicant resided and worked \nreflect no record of a charge or conviction of embezzlement or any other criminal activity. \n(Answer to SOR, Exhibit B.) \nApplicant attended a community college from 2002 to 2006, while working as an \ninformation technology consultant and earning about $40,000 per year. He dropped out \nof school because he was failing. His girlfriend at the time (GF), who was nine years older \nthan him and who worked for a credit union, introduced him to business friend (BF) who \nwas involved in real estate. \nBF was the owner and operator of a real estate development company as well as \nthe owner and operator of an apartment building management company. He had a \nreputation for successfully revitalizing communities. (GX 8 at 20.) He and several others \npurchased multiple-family buildings, converted them to condominiums, and sold the \ncondominiums as individual units. BF\u2019s business staff included a mortgage broker, two \nexperienced realtors, a certified real estate appraiser, and an experienced real estate \nlawyer, all of whom were in their 30s and 40s. One realtor was in his 60s. (GX 10 at 2.) \nAround September 2006, BF offered Applicant an opportunity to become involved in the \nenterprise, and Applicant accepted it. (Tr. 2 at 17-18.). He was 23 years old at the time. \n(GX 1 at 7.) \nApplicant, GF, BF, and others recruited buyers to purchase condominiums as \ninvestment properties or second homes. In fact, the properties were rentals and had \ntenants living in them. Buyers were assured that they would not be required to make down \npayments, pay closing costs, or be responsible for mortgage payments, even if they did \nnot have renters in their units. They were promised that they would share in the profits \nwhen the units were sold. (GX 4; Tr. 2 at 57.) \nOnce a potential buyer agreed to participate, BF and others involved in the scheme \nwould engage mortgage loan brokers and mortgage originators to prepare loan \napplications which reflected a falsely inflated purchase price; falsely represented that the \nbuyer would occupy the condominium as a primary or secondary residence; and falsely \nrepresented that the buyer had substantial assets. The buyer\u2019s income would be inflated \nin the mortgage application by adding the anticipated rental income from the \n3 \n\n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n   \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ncondominium to the buyer\u2019s other income. (Tr. 2 at 37.) BF and others would arrange with \na closing attorney to prepare false documents, including a HUD-1 settlement statement, \nwhich would falsely represent that the buyer had made a down payment and paid closing \ncosts. The mortgage lenders would then fund the mortgage loan through a wire transfer \nto the bank account of the closing attorney. The proceeds of the loan would then be \ndisbursed to BF, who paid a 3% commission to the person who recruited the buyer. (GX \n7 at 6-7.) \nApplicant started an investment consulting business in April 2007. (GX 1 at 17.) \nHe used this business to recruit buyers for BF\u2019s enterprise. (GX 4.) Applicant recruited 11 \nor 12 buyers who were his friends or friends of his friends. (Tr. 2 at 42.) \nIn November 2006, Applicant purchased a condominium through BF\u2019s enterprise \nas an investment. The purchase price was $302,000. He wrote a check for $1,000. The \ndocumentation for the purchase falsely reflected that he had made a payment of $20,000 \nfor closing costs and had about $23,000 in his bank account. (GX 7 at 8.) On the same \nday, he purchased a second condominium in a similar transaction. (GX 9 at 1; Tr 2 at 36.) \nHe used the rental income from the two condominiums to pay the mortgages. (Tr. 2 at \n31-34.) \nApplicant was not directly involved in the preparation of the falsified documents. \nHowever, he did attend about 23 closings, in which he signed documents for buyers, \nusing a power of attorney. (Tr. 2 at 46-48.) He testified that he knew the closings included \nfraudulent documents, but insisted that he did not intend to participate in fraud. He knew \nthat the buyers were not paying the closing costs as represented in the documents, but \n\u201ceverybody knew they were not coming from the buyer. The lawyers knew. The banks \nknow.\u201d (Tr. 2 at 48.) He testified that he thought it \u201cmade sense\u201d for buyers to include \nanticipated future income from rentals in their statements of current assets. (Tr. 2 at 50.) \nWhen he signed closing documents, he thought he was \u201cjust signing documents,\u201d and he \nwas not thinking about whether they were factually correct. (Tr. 2 at 51.) \nApplicant testified that he was young at the time and depended on the more \nexperienced members of the operation to know what should be done. He admitted that \nhis lawyer told him that he was guilty of \u201cwillful blindness.\u201d (Tr. 2 at 53.) He admitted that \nhe had questions about some of the transactions, but the more experienced members of \nthe enterprise gave him answers, and his concerns were superseded by their experience, \nknowledge, and professional licenses. (Tr. 2 at 85.) \nApplicant earned a 3% commission for each buyer that he recruited. He expected \nto earn $182,000, but he received only about $50,000. He testified that he stopped \nrecruiting for BF because he was not being paid. (Tr. 2 at 78.) When the real estate market \ndeclined, most of the mortgage loans involved in the fraud went into default and some \nwent into foreclosure. (GX 7 at 7.) During the sentencing proceedings, the government \npresented evidence that the fraudulent scheme created mortgage company losses \naggregating $2,844,565 for 16 properties purchased by buyers that Applicant recruited. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(GX 9 at 2.) Applicant\u2019s two mortgage loans defaulted, and his properties created bank \nlosses of $239,800 and $284,500 respectively. (GX 9 at 1.) \nCourt records reflect multiple judgments obtained against Applicant between \nMarch 2008 and February 2009. He filed a Chapter 7 bankruptcy petition in May 2009 \nand his debts were discharged in October 2009. He filed a Chapter 13 bankruptcy petition \nin August 2010, which was dismissed in December 2010. He filed another Chapter 13 \nbankruptcy petition in July 2011, which was dismissed in August 2011. (GX 5.) \nApplicant was arrested in November 2006. After a lengthy investigation, he was \nindicted in September 2010 for 11 counts of wire fraud and 6 counts of bank fraud (GX 7 \nat 47.) On November 28, 2015, pursuant to a plea agreement, he pleaded guilty to one \ncount of wire fraud and one count of bank fraud. The remaining counts were dismissed. \n(GX 11 at 1) He was sentenced to imprisonment for 24 months and supervised probation \nfor 36 months after release from prison. (GX 11 at 3.) He served his sentence and \nsuccessfully completed his probation in September 2020. (GX 12.). \nWhile Applicant was awaiting trial, he finished the requirements for an associate\u2019s \ndegree in December 2010. He earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in May 2013 and a master\u2019s \ndegree in May 2015. He also worked for a non-government company as the manager of \nbusiness intelligence until he surrendered to government authorities to serve his sentence \nto incarceration. His supervisor observed that he demonstrated discretion and integrity in \nall his business dealings, that he had a strong sense of community, and that he routinely \nvolunteered for or directly supported many charitable events to benefit military personnel \nand veterans. (Answer to SOR, Attachment 1.) A coworker who became a friend \ndescribes him as hardworking, smart, incredibly loyal, and selfless in his efforts to help \nothers. The coworker is familiar with the facts that led to his conviction and regards them \nas an anomaly and a life lesson. She regards him as a faithful and trustworthy friend. \n(Answer to SOR, Attachment 2.) \nApplicant also was ordered to pay restitution of $3,786,815 and was ordered to \nforfeit at least $7,413,712, jointly and severally with his co-defendants. (GX 11 at 5,11.) \nHe has been paying the restitution at the rate $50 per month since 2015 and is current \non his payments. (Tr. 2 at 97-98.) He filed a petition for commutation of his sentence, \nwhich was still pending at the time of the hearing. (AX C.) He testified that the purpose of \nhis clemency petition is to obtain a review of the restitution requirement. (Tr. 2 at 96.) \nApplicant\u2019s ex-girlfriend, who introduced him to BF, was sentenced to \nimprisonment for two years, three years of supervised probation, and ordered to pay \nrestitution of $3,099,224 and forfeit $7,413.712.

(Answer to \nSOR, Exhibit A.) \nApplicant was working for his current employer when the SOR was issued. His \nperformance appraisal for June 2020 through June 2021 rated him as \u201cexceeds job \nrequirements,\u201d the highest rating. His appraiser made the following comments at the end \nof his appraisal: \u201c[Applicant] is one of the best supply chain SME- (subject matter expert) \nwe have, plus equally proficient from [a] technical standpoint as well. Another great year \ncompleted with flying colors!\u201d (AX A.) \nPolicies \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 2. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge \napplies these guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \n\u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR.

The concern \nunder this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 30: \u201cCriminal activity creates doubt about a person's \njudgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a \nperson's ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations.\u201d \nThe following disqualifying conditions are relevant: \nAG \u00b6 31(a): a pattern of minor offenses, any one of which on its own would \nbe unlikely to affect a national security eligibility decision, but which in \ncombination cast doubt on the individual's judgment, reliability, or \ntrustworthiness; \nAG \u00b6 31(b): evidence (including, but not limited to, a credible allegation, an \nadmission, and matters of official record) of criminal conduct, regardless of \nwhether the individual was formally charged, prosecuted, or convicted; and \nAG \u00b6 31(c): individual is currently on parole or probation. \nAG \u00b6 31(a) is not established. The embezzlement charge in 2001 was a \u201cminor\u201d \noffense under the circumstances, but the charges in 2006 were felonies. Thus, there is \nnot a \u201cpattern of minor offenses.\u201d However, AG \u00b6 32(b) is established by a \u201ccredible \nallegation\u201d of embezzlement and Applicant\u2019s conviction of wire fraud and bank fraud. \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 31(c) is not established. Applicant has completed his period of probation. \nThe unsatisfied restitution does not constitute parole or probation. \nThe following mitigating conditions are potentially relevant: \nAG \u00b6 32(a): so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior \nhappened, or it happened under such unusual circumstances, that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; and \nAG \u00b6 32(d): there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including, but not \nlimited to, the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, \nrestitution, compliance with the terms of parole or probation, job training or \nhigher education, good employment record, or constructive community \ninvolvement. \nAG \u00b6 32(a) is established for the charge of embezzlement alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.b. \nApplicant was 17 years old at the time. No action was taken, the offense was minor, and \nmore than five years elapsed before Applicant became involved in the criminal conduct \nalleged in SOR \u00b6 1.a. \nAG \u00b6 32(a) is not fully established for the criminal conduct alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.a. \nThe first prong of AG \u00b6 32(a) focuses on whether the criminal conduct was recent. There \nare no bright line rules for determining when conduct is recent. The determination must \nbe based on a careful evaluation of the evidence. See ISCR Case No. 02-24452 at 6 \n(App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2004). If the evidence shows a significant period of time has passed \nwithout any evidence of misconduct, then an administrative judge must determine \nwhether that period of time demonstrates changed circumstances or conduct sufficient to \nwarrant a finding of reform or rehabilitation. Id. \nApplicant\u2019s criminal conduct ended with his arrest in November 2006, more than \n14 years ago, which is a \u201csignificant period of time.\u201d However, he was awaiting trial, \nincarcerated, or on probation until September 2020. He has been under pressure to \nobtain a security clearance until the present. He has not completed the restitution \nimposed by the court. When Applicant purchased his first property, he was aware that his \ndocuments falsely represented that he had made a down payment, paid the closing costs, \nand was purchasing a first or second home. Nevertheless, he continued to recruit \npurchasers and sign documents that he knew were false. He purchased a second \nproperty through the same fraudulent process. \nHowever, Applicant\u2019s criminal conduct occurred under somewhat unusual \ncircumstances. He had dropped out of college due to failing grades, was sporadically \nemployed, and he had low income. He was introduced to BF\u2019s criminal enterprise by GF, \nan older woman with financial experience, with whom he was romantically involved. He \ndid not know that GF was also involved in BF\u2019s enterprise. \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 32(b) is established. Applicant was remorseful, candid, and credible at the \nhearing. He has successfully completed his probation and is making regular payments in \nrestitution. He was highly regarded by his employer for whom he worked while awaiting \ntrial. He completed his college education and earned a master\u2019s degree while awaiting \ntrial. A current coworker who became a friend described his conduct as an anomaly and \na life lesson, and she regards him as a faithful and trustworthy friend. His most recent \nperformance evaluation rated him in the top category (\u201cexceeds job requirements\u201d). In \nNovember 2020, the governor of the state where he lives and works restored his civil \nrights and removed most of the political disabilities resulting from his conviction. After \ncarefully considering all the evidence, I am satisfied that Applicant is rehabilitated. \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \nThe SOR cross-alleges the criminal conduct alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b under \nthis guideline. The security concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 15: \u201cConduct \ninvolving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply \nwith rules and regulations can raise questions about an individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and ability to protect classified or sensitive information. . . .\u201d \nI have considered whether the following disqualifying conditions under this \nguideline are applicable: \nAG \u00b6 16(c): credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas \nthat is not sufficient for an adverse determination under any other single \nguideline, but which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-person \nassessment of questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack \nof candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations, or other \ncharacteristics indicating that the individual may not properly safeguard \nclassified or sensitive information; \nAG \u00b6 16(d): credible adverse information that is not explicitly covered under \nany other guideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an adverse \ndetermination, but which, when combined with all available information, \nsupports a whole-person assessment of questionable judgment, \nuntrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with \nrules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that the individual \nmay not properly safeguard classified or sensitive information. . . ; and \nAG \u00b6 16(e): personal conduct, or concealment of information about one's \nconduct, that creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress \nby a foreign intelligence entity or other individual or group. Such conduct \nincludes . . . engaging in activities which, if known, could affect the person's \npersonal, professional, or community standing. \nAG \u00b6 16(c) is established by the evidence. Although Guideline F was not alleged \nin the SOR, Applicant\u2019s conduct was covered by Guideline F and Guideline J, specifically \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 19(d) (\u201cdeceptive or illegal financial practices such as embezzlement, . . . mortgage \nfraud, filing deceptive loan statements and other intentional financial breaches of trust\u201d), \nif it had been alleged. \nAG \u00b6 16(d) is not applicable. Applicant\u2019s conduct was explicitly covered under \nGuideline J. \nAG \u00b6 16(e) is established. Applicant\u2019s participation in fraudulent conduct adversely\naffected his personal, professional, and community standing. \n \nThe following mitigating conditions are potentially applicable. \nAG \u00b6 17(c): the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior \nis so infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is unlikely \nto recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, trustworthiness, or \ngood judgment; \nAG \u00b6 17(d): the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the stressors, \ncircumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, unreliable, or other \ninappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to recur; \nAG \u00b6 17(e): the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate \nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress; and \nAG \u00b6 17(g): association with persons involved in criminal activities was unwitting, \nhas ceased, or occurs under circumstances that do not cast doubt upon the \nindividual's reliability, trustworthiness, judgment, or willingness to comply with rules \nand regulations. \nAG \u00b6 17(c) is established for the reasons set out in the above discussion of AG \n32(a). \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 17(d) and 17(e) are partially established by Applicant\u2019s acknowledgment of \nhis criminal behavior and his outstanding performance as an employee of a defense \ncontractor. \nAG \u00b6 17(g) is established because Applicant no longer associates with persons \ninvolved in criminal activity. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-\nperson concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \n10 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nsecurity clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process \nfactors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nI have incorporated my comments under Guideline J and E in my whole-person \nanalysis and applied the adjudicative factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). After weighing the disqualifying \nand mitigating conditions under those guidelines, and evaluating all the evidence in the \ncontext of the whole person, I conclude that Applicant has mitigated the security concerns \nraised under Guidelines J and E. \nFormal Findings \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \nParagraph 1, Guideline J (Criminal Conduct): \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a and 1.b: \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline E (Personal Conduct): \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nI conclude that it is clearly consistent with the national security interests of the \nUnited States to grant Applicant eligibility for access to classified information.

Applicant responded to the SOR on March 17, 2020, and requested a \nhearing before an administrative judge. The case was assigned to me on November 23, \n2021. \nThe hearing was convened as scheduled on December 20, 2021. Government \nExhibits (GE) 1, 5, and 6 were admitted in evidence without objection. The objection to \nGE 2 was sustained. The objections to GE 3 and 4 were overruled. Applicant testified \nand submitted Applicant\u2019s Exhibits (AE) 1 through 24, which were admitted without \nobjection. The record was held open for Applicant to submit additional information.

He immigrated to the United States in 2003, and \nhe became a U.S. citizen in 2011. His first wife is also from Sri Lanka. Applicant and his \nfirst wife owned a business from 2005 to 2014.

His current wife is a citizen and resident of Sri Lanka. \n(Tr. at 21, 27-28, 39) \nThe SOR alleges nine delinquent debts totaling about $28,000. Applicant \nadmitted owing all of the debts in the SOR, with the exception of the $145 debt to a \ncable television provider (SOR \u00b6 1.h), which he believes was paid by his ex-wife. He \nsuccessfully disputed the debt with Experian in 2018. All of the remaining debts became \ndelinquent in 2013 or 2014, except the $576 debt in SOR \u00b6 1.g, which became \ndelinquent in 2015. They are all listed on the 2018 credit report. On the December 2021 \ncredit report, all but the $576 debt in SOR \u00b6 1.g were past the seven-year reporting \nperiod and were no longer listed. The $576 debt in SOR \u00b6 1.g was listed on the \nDecember 2021 Experian and TransUnion credit reports. The TransUnion report \nestimated that the debt will be removed in February 2022. It is not listed on the \nDecember 2021 Equifax report.

He plans to obtain his bachelor\u2019s degree, return to the United States, \nget a good job, bring his wife to the United States, and pay his debts once he has the \nmeans to do so. If he obtains a security clearance, he will be hired by a defense \ncontractor as a linguist, earning about $86,000 per year. He has about $60,000 in \ndeferred student loans. He stated that his ex-wife understands that he is unable to pay \nchild support for their child.

He is praised for his reliability, dependability, work ethic, honesty, \nresponsibility, intelligence, trustworthiness, professionalism, and integrity. (AE 22-24) \nPolicies \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG), which became \neffective on June 8, 2017. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant has a history of financial problems, including multiple delinquent debts. \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and 19(c) are applicable. \nConditions that could mitigate the financial considerations security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 20. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control; \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \nApplicant admitted owing all of the debts alleged in the SOR, except the $145 \ndebt to a cable television provider (SOR \u00b6 1.h), which he believes was paid by his ex-\nwife. That debt is mitigated. \nApplicant attributed his financial problems to the failure of his and his ex-wife\u2019s \nbusiness, his divorce, and his inability to find a better-paying job than the one he had \nbefore he quit in 2014. Applicant and his ex-wife decided that their best option was for \nhim to move back to Sri Lanka in 2014 with their child and live with Applicant\u2019s parents \nwhile his ex-wife completed her degree in the United States. He brought their child back \nto the United States in 2017, but he returned to Sri Lanka where he continues to live. \nIf Applicant obtains a security clearance, he will be hired by a defense contractor \nas a linguist, earning about $86,000 per year. He has about $60,000 in deferred student \nloans. He paid two small debts that were not alleged in the SOR in 2019. His long-term \nplan is to obtain his bachelor\u2019s degree, return to the United States, get a good job, bring \nhis wife to the United States, and pay his debts once he has the means to do so. \nHowever, intentions to pay debts in the future are not a substitute for a track record of \ndebt repayment or other responsible approaches. See ISCR Case No. 11-14570 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Oct. 23, 2013). Applicant does not have a track record that would enable me \nto project with any degree of certainty that he will complete his long-term plan and pay \nhis debts. \nThere is insufficient evidence for a determination that Applicant\u2019s financial \nproblems will be resolved within a reasonable period. I am unable to find that he acted \nresponsibly under the circumstances or that he made a good-faith effort to pay his \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ndebts. His financial issues are recent and ongoing. They continue to cast doubt on his \ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. I find that financial \nconsiderations security concerns remain despite the presence of some mitigation. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. I also considered Applicant\u2019s \nfavorable character evidence. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude Applicant did not \nmitigate the financial considerations security concerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.g: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.h: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.i: \nAgainst Applicant \n6 \n\n________________________ \nConclusion \nIt is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for \na security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nEdward W. Loughran \nAdministrative Judge \n7 \n",

Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nStatement of the Case \nApplicant submitted a security clearance application on September 19, 2018. On \nFebruary 13, 2020, the Defense Counterintelligence and Security Agency Consolidated \nAdjudications Facility (CAF) sent him a Statement of Reasons (SOR) alleging security \nconcerns under Guideline F. The DOD CAF acted under Executive Order (Exec. Or.) \n10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as \namended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance \nReview Program (January 2, 1992), and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated in \nSecurity Executive Agent Directive 4, National Security Adjudicative Guidelines \n(December 10, 2016). \nApplicant answered the SOR on a date not reflected in the record and requested \na hearing before an administrative judge. His answer was returned by the CAF on \nSeptember 17, 2020, because it was incomplete. He submitted his corrected answer on \n\n \n2 \n \nOctober 21, 2020. Department Counsel was ready to proceed on February 16, 2021, but \nscheduling of the hearing was delayed by health precautions imposed in response to \nCOVID-19. The case was assigned to me on September 24, 2021. On October 5, 2021, \nthe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) notified Applicant that the hearing \nwas scheduled for October 20, 2021. I convened the hearing as scheduled. Government \nExhibits (GX) 1 through 5 were admitted in evidence without objection. Applicant testified, \nand submitted Applicant\u2019s Exhibits (AX) A through E, which were admitted without \nobjection.  \n \nI kept the record open until November 5, 2021, to enable Applicant to submit \nadditional documentary evidence. At Appellant\u2019s request, I extended the deadline for \nsubmitting additional evidence to December 10, 2021. He timely submitted AX F through \nK, which were admitted without objection. AX F, the cover memorandum for his \nsupplemental submission, was marked as an exhibit because of its testimonial nature. \nAlthough AX F listed several supplemental exhibits, including a tracking document for \nreturn of telecommunications equipment, no tracking document was included in his \nsupplemental submission \n \nDOHA received the transcript (Tr.) on October 27, 2021. The record closed on \nDecember 10, 2021. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn Applicant\u2019s answer to the SOR, he admitted the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.c \nand denied the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d-1.f. His admissions in his answer and at the \nhearing are incorporated in my findings of fact.  \n \n \nApplicant is a 45-year-old information systems developer employed by a federal \ncontractor since May 2018. He married in November 2004, divorced in June 2008, and \nmarried his current spouse in July 2010. He obtained a bachelor\u2019s degree in computer \nscience in 2002 and a master\u2019s degree and a doctorate in theology in May 2018. He has \nnever held a security clearance. \n \n \nApplicant has five children, ages 22, 21, 19, 14, and 8. The oldest is active-duty \nmilitary. The second oldest just graduated from college and lives at home while looking \nfor a job. The 19-year-old is in college but is financially self-sufficient.  \n \n \nApplicant testified that he and his wife were both employed in public school \nsystems in 2012. He earned about $80,000 per year and his wife earned $50-60 thousand \nper year, but they did not know how to budget their money. In 2014, they both took pay \ncuts to work in a charter school. Due to personality conflicts with the director of the charter \nschool, Applicant\u2019s wife was fired in December 2015, and he was fired in February 2016. \n(Tr. 23.) As a result, their car was repossessed and they were evicted from their home. \n(Tr. 19-20.) \n \n\n \n3 \n \n \nApplicant was self-employed from February 2016 to May 2017, when he was hired \nby a non-federal employer as a system developer. He was fired in November 2017, \nbecause his meticulous manner of working was not consistent with the fast-paced work \nethic of his employer. (Tr. 24.) After being fired, he was self-employed until he was hired \nby his current employer in May 2018. \n \n \nIn response to DOD CAF interrogatories, Applicant submitted a personal financial \nstatement in September 2019 reflecting his net monthly salary of $5,804; his spouse\u2019s net \nmonthly salary of $4,010; monthly expenses of $5,910; debt payments of $2,590; and a \nnet monthly remainder of $3,910. (GX 2 at 8.) Applicant recently received a raise to about \n$110,000 per year. (Tr. 32-33.) \n \n \nThe evidence concerning the allegations in the SOR debts is summarized below. \n \n \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b, failure to file federal and state income tax returns as \nrequired for tax years 2012, 2013, 2014, and 2015. Applicant attributed his failure to \ntimely file his federal and state tax returns to procrastination. (AX F.) In response to CAF \ninterrogatories in September 2019, he stated that he had filed all his past-due returns but \nthat his tax preparer had destroyed his copies of them. He stated that he had filed the \nreturns again but had not received the tax transcripts reflecting that they had been filed. \n(GX 2 at 7.) He attached receipts reflecting that large envelopes had been mailed on \nSeptember 13, 2019 (the same day that he responded to DOD CAF interrogatories about \nhis delinquent debts and past-due tax returns), to cities where the federal and state tax \nauthorities are located. (GX 2 at 17.)  \n \nIn Applicant\u2019s post-hearing submission, he submitted an unsigned copy of his \nfederal return for 2012, but he submitted no proof that it was mailed or received. (AX I.) \nHe submitted a copy of his state return for 2012. (AX H.) He submitted no proof of mailing \nor receipt for the state return, but he submitted a document reflecting that his claim for a \nrefund was denied because he did not file his return within three years from the due date. \n(AX G.) The denial of a claim for a refund indicates that the state return for 2012 was filed. \nHe provided no documentary evidence that the other past-due state returns had been \nfiled. \n \nIn September 2020, Applicant submitted a request for an installment agreement \nfor his state tax debt of $26,884, requesting that it be paid in monthly installments of $460. \n(AX J.) He submitted no proof that the request was mailed, received, or accepted. At the \nhearing, he testified that $442 has been deducted from his bank account every month \nsince October 2020. (Tr. 63.) He did not submit any documentation to support his \ntestimony.  \n \nAt the hearing, Applicant testified that he owed about $4,000 in federal income \ntaxes and that he intended to request a payment agreement. (Tr. 57-58) He submitted no \nevidence of a payment agreement as of the date the record closed.  \n \n\n \n4 \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s federal and state tax debts were not alleged in the SOR. Accordingly, \nI have considered them only for the limited purpose of evaluating his evidence of \nmitigation and as part of my whole-person analysis.  \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.c, car loan charged off for $8,948. The debt is the deficiency after a car \nwas repossessed. (GX 3 at 6.) In September 2021, Applicant offered to settle this debt \nfor a lump-sum payment of $3,183. When this offer was rejected, he offered to pay $150 \nper month, and this offer was accepted. (AX A.) He submitted no evidence that he had \nmade any of the agreed payments as of the date the record closed.  \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.d, public housing debt referred for collection of $646. Applicant paid \nthis debt in December 2020. (AX K.) \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.e, telecommunications debt referred for collection of $269. At the \nhearing, Applicant testified that this debt was incurred when his ex-wife opened a \ncellphone account in his name and did not pay the bill. He testified that he contacted the \ncellphone servicer and reported that the account was fraudulently opened by his ex-wife, \nbut they did nothing in response to his report. (Tr. 33-34.) In Applicant\u2019s post-hearing \nsubmission, he gave a different explanation, stating that this debt was for unreturned \ntelecommunications equipment, that he had returned the equipment, and a tracking \nrecord for return of the equipment was attached to his cover letter. However, no tracking \nrecord was attached. (AX F.) The debt is not resolved. \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.f, medical bill referred for collection of $162. Applicant disputed this \ndebt because he believed it was covered by his insurance. He submitted documentation \nthat he had medical insurance, but his documentation does not reflect whether the small \ndebt alleged in the SOR was a copayment or some other expense not covered by the \nterms of his insurance policy. He told a security investigator that his insurance company \ninformed him that the original creditor had not submitted a claim for this bill. (GX 2 at 3.) \nAt the hearing, he testified that he had Medicaid until shortly before he had a routine \nmedical checkup. He told the doctor\u2019s office that he was no longer on Medicaid but was \ncovered by his wife\u2019s insurance. However, the doctor\u2019s office submitted the bill to \nMedicaid, which refused to cover it. According to Applicant, the doctor\u2019s office refused to \nresubmit the bill. Applicant testified that he offered to pay part of the bill, but the doctor\u2019s \noffice insisted on full payment. (Tr. 41-42.) He did not submit any documentation to \nsupport his dispute. \n \n \nApplicant submitted evidence that a credit-card bill for $2,694, which was not \nalleged in the SOR, had been paid in full. (AX E) At the hearing, he testified that he \nsubmitted this document to demonstrate due diligence in resolving his financial problems. \n(Tr. 11.) \n \nPolicies \n \n \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\n \n5 \n \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 2.  \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge \napplies these guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \n \n \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \n\u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \n \n \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 15-01253 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2016).   \n \n \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, \nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-\n31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).  \n \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-\n\n \n6 \n \n20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18:  \n \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. . . An individual who is financially \noverextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or otherwise \nquestionable acts to generate funds. . . . \n \n \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified information to raise money. It encompasses concerns about a \nperson\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting classified \ninformation. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information. See ISCR \nCase No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s admissions and the evidence submitted at the hearing establish the \nfollowing disqualifying conditions under this guideline: \n \nAG \u00b6 19(a): inability to satisfy debts; \n \nAG \u00b6 19(c): a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \n \nAG \u00b6 19(f): failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local \nincome tax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax as required. \n \nThe following mitigating conditions are potentially applicable: \n \nAG \u00b6 20(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not \ncast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \nAG \u00b6 20(b): the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \n\n \n7 \n \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \nAG \u00b6 20(d): the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to \nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts;  \n \nAG \u00b6 20(e): the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy \nof the past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue; and \n \nAG \u00b6 20(g): the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax \nauthority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(a) is not established. Applicant\u2019s debts are numerous. The debt alleged \nin SOR \u00b6 1.d was resolved only recently, and the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.e and 1.f are \nnot resolved. None of the debts were incurred under circumstances making recurrence \nunlikely. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(b) is not fully established. Applicant was fired from jobs in in February \n2016 and November 2017, which were conditions largely beyond his control, but he has \nnot acted responsibly. His repeated failures to timely file his income tax returns were \nunrelated to his employment. He did not take action to resolve the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.c until \nSeptember 2021, shortly before the hearing. He did not pay the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.d until \nDecember 2020, well after he received the SOR. He has given conflicting explanations \nfor the unresolved debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.e. The medical debt in SOR \u00b6 1.f is unresolved. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(d) is established for the debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.d, which has been paid. \nIt is not established for the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c, 1.e, and 1.f. Applicant submitted \nno documentary evidence that he was making the agreed payments for the debt in SOR \n\u00b6 1.c or that the equipment that was the basis for the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.e had been returned. \nWhen an applicant asserts that a debt has been resolved or is being resolved, he or she \nis expected to present documentary evidence showing resolution of the debts. ISCR Case \nNo. 15-03363 at 2 (App. Bd. Oct. 19, 2016). \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(e) is not established. Although Applicant claimed that he disputed the \nmedical debt in SOR \u00b6 1.f, he submitted no documentation showing that his current \ninsurance covered the debt and no documentation that he disputed the debt with the \nmedical office or the credit reporting agencies. The amount of this debt is of minimal \nsecurity significance, but Applicant\u2019s failure to document his dispute or resolve the debt \nis relevant to his pattern of financial procrastination. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(g) is not established. Although Applicant submitted evidence that he \nmailed envelopes to the federal and state tax authorities, his evidence does not reflect \n\n \n8 \n \nthe contents of those documents. The state tax authority\u2019s denial of his claim for a refund \nfor tax year 2012 does not establish that the returns for other years were filed.  \n \nFurthermore, even if Applicant filed all the past-due federal and state tax returns, \nthe untimely filings do not end the inquiry. The fact that an applicant has filed past-due \nreturns \u201cdoes not preclude careful consideration of [an applicant\u2019s] security worthiness \nbased on longstanding prior behavior evidencing irresponsibility.\u201d ISCR Case No. 12-\n05053 (App. Bd. Oct. 30, 2014). A security clearance adjudication is not directed toward \ninducing an applicant to tile tax returns. It is aimed at an applicant\u2019s judgment and \nreliability. A person who fails repeatedly to fulfill his or her legal obligations does not \ndemonstrate the high degree of good judgment and reliability required of those granted \naccess to classified information. See ISCR Case No. 14-01894 at 5 (App. Bd. Aug. 18, \n2015). \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-\nperson concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process \nfactors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \n \nI have incorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis, \nand I have considered the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). Applicant was sincere and candid at the \nhearing, but he is a disorganized procrastinator. He was given substantial time after the \nhearing to provide documentary evidence in support of his declared intentions to resolve \nhis debts, but he failed to take advantage of that opportunity. After weighing the \ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions under Guideline F, and evaluating all the evidence \nin the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has not mitigated the security \nconcerns raised by his repeated failures to timely file his federal and state income tax \nreturns and his failure to resolve his delinquent debts. \n \n \n \n\n \n9 \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \n \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations: \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.c, 1.e, and 1.f: \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.d:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national security interests of the \nUnited States to grant Applicant eligibility for access to classified information.

(Item 1.) In his \nAnswer he admitted all the allegations in the SOR except 1.f, which he did not admit or \ndeny. Applicant\u2019s sole statement of explanation was, \u201cPlease see previous statements on \nall items.\u201d On July 13, 2021, Department Counsel submitted the Department\u2019s written \ncase. A complete copy of the file of relevant material (FORM), consisting of Items 1 to 9, \nwas provided to Applicant, who received the file on July 22, 2021. \nApplicant was given 30 days from receipt of the FORM to file objections and submit \nmaterial in refutation, extenuation, or mitigation. Applicant did not submit any additional \ninformation. The case was assigned to me on September 22, 2021. Based upon a review \nof the pleadings and exhibits, national security eligibility for access to classified \ninformation is denied. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant is 55 years old and married to his second wife. He has two children and \ntwo stepchildren. Applicant served in the Army and received an Honorable Discharge in \n1990. Applicant has been employed by a defense contractor (Company A) since 2018 as \na Management Specialist 3 and seeks to obtain or retain national security eligibility and \na security clearance in connection with his employment.

Applicant admitted all the allegations \nunder this paragraph, except 1.f to which he did not respond either way. \nApplicant worked for Company B from 2006 to 2017. His last position was as a \nProject Lead. SOR allegations 1.a, 1.b, and 1.c concern his employment with this firm. \n1.a. Applicant admitted in his Answer that he received a written warning in about \nJanuary 2014 from Company B due to his failure to submit his daily time as required by \npolicy. The record does not contain any information that would explain or otherwise justify \nhis conduct. \n1.b. Applicant admitted in his Answer that he received a Corrective Action Memo \nfrom Company B in July 2017. He received this memo because of a failure to follow \ncompany policy in executing tasks as directed, failure to report information, and \ntransposing information to hide the current status of a business proposal.

Applicant was terminated from his employment with Company B in September \n2017 for theft of company property. In his e-QIP under Section 13A, Applicant admitted \nthe termination, stating, \u201cFailed to follow company policy by taking home scrap material. \nThe scrap material was returned within 3 days however, the company terminated my \nemployment.\u201d (Item 2.) \nIn his termination letter Applicant\u2019s Program Manager stated: \n[I]t has been determined that you removed a considerable amount of \ngovernment owned aircraft parts from the workplace to your home without \nprior authorization and in violation of Company rules and precedent. Upon \nquestioning, you admitted to taking the material without permission and that \nyou were aware that your conduct is prohibited and a violation of the \nEmployee Handbook. (Item 4.) \nCompany B reported the termination to the DoD in a JPAS Incident History Report. \nCompany B stated that the value of the property taken by Applicant was $7,000. (Item 3.) \nApplicant was interviewed by an investigator from the Office of Personnel \nManagement on September 19, 2018. A report of investigation (ROI) was prepared by \nthe investigator, which Applicant later adopted stating that it was accurate. In the ROI \nApplicant admitted taking the material, which he thought was scrap to be thrown out. \nApplicant further stated that he believed the value of the material was only $600 or $700. \nApplicant returned the material after being confronted by management concerning his \nconduct. (Item 5 at 5.) \nThe ROI stated, \u201cSubject [Applicant] felt bad for creating that situation and felt \nstupid for taking the material. The incident was the most humiliating situation Subject has \never been through. Subject lost his job, which he liked very much.\u201d (Item 5 at 5.) \nThe next three allegations concern Applicant\u2019s responses to his e-QIP, dated \nMarch 26, 2018. (Item 2.) \n1.d. Section 13A of Applicant\u2019s e-QIP concerned his employment activities. The \nform requires specific answers to questions about Applicant\u2019s employment activities \nwithin 10 years. Under this section Applicant set forth his employment with Company B \nfrom 2010 to 2017 and the nature of his termination. The questionnaire also asked, \n\u201cReceived Discipline or Warning: For this employment, in the last seven (7) years \nhave you received a written warning, been officially reprimanded, suspended, or \ndisciplined for misconduct in the workplace, such as a violation of security policy?\u201d [All \nemphasis in original.] Applicant answered, \u201cNo.\u201d This was a false answer as Applicant \nfailed to disclose the written warning he received in 2014, or the Corrective Action Memo \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nhe received in 2017, as set forth in subparagraphs 1.a and 1.b, above. The record does \nnot contain any information that would explain or otherwise justify his conduct. \n1.e. Section 13A of the e-QIP also required Applicant to, \u201cList all of your \nemployment activities, including unemployment and self-employment, beginning with the \npresent and working back 10 years. The entire period must be accounted for without \nbreaks.\u201d Applicant described various periods of employment or unemployment from 2006 \nto March 2018, when he filled out Item 2. However, Applicant admitted that he failed to \nlist self-employment as the owner and operator of a small business from at least the \nSummer of 2004 to at least September 2017. The record does not contain any further \ninformation about this employment, or any information that would explain or otherwise \njustify his failure to disclose this self-employment. \n1.f. Applicant did not admit or deny this allegation in his Answer. His silence is \nviewed as a denial. \nSection 26 of Item 2 asked Applicant questions about his financial situation within \nseven years of the date he filled out the form. Specific sub-sections of this section asked \nApplicant about debts that were charged off, in collection, or that involved repossessions. \nApplicant admitted in the e-QIP that he had one charged-off credit card account that he \nhad resolved in 2017. He denied any other delinquencies. The SOR alleged that the debts \nset forth under subparagraphs 2.a, 2.h, and 2.i, below, fit the criteria of the questions and \nwere intentionally omitted on the questionnaire. The nature of these debts is discussed \nbelow. \nParagraph 2 (Guideline F, Financial Considerations) \nThe Government alleges in this paragraph that Applicant is ineligible for clearance \nbecause he is financially overextended and therefore potentially unreliable, \nuntrustworthy, or at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. Applicant \nadmitted all the allegations under this guideline. \nThe SOR alleged that Applicant has eight debts that are past due, charged-off, or \nin collection, in the total amount of approximately $24,597. He also had a repossession \nof an airplane, and a garnishment in the amount of $17,029. The existence and amount \nof these debts is supported by his admissions to all financial SOR allegations in his \nAnswer and credit reports. dated May 16, 2018; December 17, 2018; October 21, 2019; \nand July 13, 2021. They are also confirmed by Applicant\u2019s answers during an interview \nwith an investigator from the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) held on September \n9, 2018. (Items 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9.) \n2.a. Applicant admitted owing a charged-off credit card account in the amount of \n$16, 936.

No information was submitted to show that this debt \nhas been paid or otherwise resolved. \n2.i. Applicant admitted that he had an airplane repossessed in 2017 due to his \nfailure to make his monthly payments to a bank. No further information was submitted \nregarding this debt. This debt should have been admitted by Applicant on his e-QIP. \n2.j. Applicant admitted having his wages garnished from his employer in June 2018 \nin the amount of $17,029.

In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines (AG) list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. The entire \nprocess is a conscientious scrutiny of applicable guidelines in the context of a number of \nvariables known as the whole-person concept. The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires, \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. I have not drawn inferences based on mere speculation or \nconjecture. \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.14, requires the Government to present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, \u201cThe applicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants national \nsecurity eligibility. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the \napplicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as \nto potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified or sensitive information. \nFinally, as emphasized in Section 7 of Executive Order 10865, \u201cAny determination under \nthis order adverse to an applicant shall be a determination in terms of the national interest \nand shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d \nSee also Executive Order 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information.) \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAnalysis \nParagraph 1 (Guideline E, Personal Conduct) \nThe security concerns relating to the guideline for personal conduct are set out in \nAG \u00b6 15, which states: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. \nAG \u00b6 16 describes two conditions that could raise security concerns and may be \ndisqualifying in this case: \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar \nform used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, \naward benefits or status, determine national security eligibility or \ntrustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities; and \n(c) credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is \nnot sufficient for an adverse determination under any other single guideline, \nbut which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-person \nassessment of questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack \nof candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations, or other \ncharacteristics indicating that the individual may not properly safeguard \nclassified or sensitive information; \n(d) credible adverse information that is not explicitly covered under any \nother guideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an adverse \ndetermination, but which, when combined with all available information, \nsupports a whole-person assessment of questionable judgment, \nuntrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with \nrules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that the individual \nmay not properly safeguard classified or sensitive information. This \nincludes, but is not limited to, consideration of: \n(1) untrustworthy, or unreliable behavior to include breach of client \nconfidentiality, release of proprietary information, unauthorized \nrelease of sensitive corporate or government protected information; \n(2) any disruptive, violent, or other inappropriate behavior; \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(3) a pattern of dishonesty or rule violations; and \n(4) evidence of significant misuse of Government or other employer\u2019s \ntime or resources; and \n(e) personal conduct or concealment of information about one\u2019s conduct, \nthat creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress by a \nforeign intelligence entity or other individual or group. Such conduct \nincludes: \n(1) engaging in activities which, if known, could affect the person\u2019s \npersonal, professional, or community standing. \nTurning first to Applicant\u2019s employment with Company B. Applicant\u2019s admissions \nand the available evidence show that he had issues with this employment. These issues\nculminated in his decision to take \u201cscrap\u201d material from work without permission. Applicant \nwas confronted by management about his action, admitted it, returned the material and \nwas terminated. AG \u00b6 16(c) applies to this conduct. \n \nNext, with regard to Applicant\u2019s answers on his e-QIP, Item 2. Applicant admitted \nthat he intentionally failed to inform the Government of his disciplinary issues at Company \nB. He also intentionally failed to inform the Government of his self-employment for over \nten years. Finally, the debts set forth in SOR 2.a and 2.i should have been admitted on \nthe questionnaire. AG \u00b6 16(a) applies to this conduct. \nThe guideline includes three conditions in AG \u00b6 17 that could mitigate the security \nconcerns arising from Applicant\u2019s work-related misconduct and falsifications: \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; and \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, \nunreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to \nrecur. \nTurning first to Applicant\u2019s work-related conduct. Applicant elected not to respond \nto the FORM, and the record does not have any explanations for the first two incidents. \nThe third, for which he was terminated, involved Applicant removing items from his \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nemployer without permission that he stated was \u201cscrap.\u201d The nature of the material is of \nno moment; it was the act that showed bad judgment for which no mitigation is provided. \nSOR allegations 1.a, 1.b. and 1.c are not mitigated. \nApplicant has also not mitigated the significance of his 2018 falsification. Applicant \ndid not provide accurate information about his employment, including self-employment, \nand did not inform the Government fully and truthfully concerning his financial situation. \nSOR allegations 1.d, 1.e, and 1.f are not mitigated. Paragraph 1 is found against \nApplicant. \nParagraph 2 (Guideline F, Financial Considerations) \nThe security concerns relating to the guideline for financial considerations are set \nout in AG \u00b6 18, which reads in pertinent part: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAG \u00b6 19 describes two conditions that could raise security concerns and may be\ndisqualifying in this case:  \n \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant has incurred over $24,000 in past-due indebtedness over the past \nseveral years. He evidently paid two of the debts alleged in the SOR. (SOR allegations \n2.c and 2.d.) However, the remainder of the debts are unresolved. He also did not submit \nany information concerning the repossession of an airplane or the current status of the \ngarnishment of his wages. These facts establish prima facie support for the foregoing \ndisqualifying conditions, and shift the burden to Applicant to mitigate those concerns. \nThe guideline includes three conditions in AG \u00b6 20 that could mitigate the security \nconcerns arising from Applicant\u2019s alleged financial difficulties: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; and \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control. \nThe evidence does not establish that any of the above mitigating conditions apply \nto Applicant. He failed to submit any evidence that would tend to support any of them. \nThere is no basis for me to find that Applicant has mitigated the security concerns arising \nfrom his financial situation. Paragraph 2 is found against Applicant. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s potential for national security eligibility by considering the totality of the \napplicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should \nconsider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant national security \neligibility for a security clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon \ncareful consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \npertinent facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant has not mitigated the \nconcerns over his considerable past-due indebtedness, his work-related conduct, and his \nfalsifications on a Government questionnaire. Overall, the record evidence creates \nsubstantial doubt as to Applicant\u2019s present suitability for national security eligibility and a \nsecurity clearance. \n10 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n                                                \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline E: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a through 1.f: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 2.a through 2.b: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 2.c through 2.d: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 2.e through 2.j: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s national \nsecurity eligibility for a security clearance.

Scheduling of the hearing was delayed by the COVID-19 health \nprecautions. The case was assigned to me on May 18, 2022. On June 6, 2022, the \nDefense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) notified Applicant that the hearing was \nscheduled to be conducted by video teleconference on June 23, 2022. I convened the \nhearing as scheduled. Government Exhibits (GX) 1 and 2 were admitted in evidence \nwithout objection. Applicant testified and submitted Applicant\u2019s Exhibits (AX) A through I, \nwhich were admitted without objection. I kept the record open until August 10, 2022, to \nenable him to submit additional documentary evidence. He did not submit anything \nfurther. DOHA received the transcript (Tr.) on July 6, 2022. The record closed on August \n10, 2022. \nFindings of Fact \nIn Applicant\u2019s answer to the SOR, he admitted the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and \n1.b, alleging that he failed to file his federal and state income tax returns for tax years \n2010 through 2016. His admissions are incorporated in my findings of fact. \nApplicant is a 34-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He worked for this \nemployer as a shipfitter from October 2009 to April 2017, when he became a quality \ninspector. He was promoted to a manager position in August 2021. (Tr. 21.) He has never \nheld a security clearance. \nApplicant graduated from high school in July 2007 and attended some college \ncourses, but he did not receive a degree. He is currently a part-time student, working \ntoward a bachelor\u2019s degree in business management. His educational expenses are paid \nby his employer. (Tr. 16, 20-21.) He married in August 2014 and has two children and two \nstepchildren, all of whom live with him and his wife. \nAs a shipfitter, Applicant earned around $40,000 per year. His pay increased to \nabout $60,000 to $70,000 per year when he became a quality inspector. As a manager, \nhe now earns about $75,000 to $80,000 per year. (Tr. 22-23.) Applicant\u2019s wife is a nurse, \nworks part time, and earns $40,000 to $45,000 per year. (Tr. 26-27.) He estimates that \ntheir net monthly remainder after paying all expenses is about $1,000 per month. (Tr. 29.) \nApplicant and his wife own their home. They refinanced their home mortgage loan \nin August 2021 for $226,000. (Tr. 30.) In March 2021, they purchased two used vehicles, \nmodel years 2005 and 2008. In April 2022, they purchased another used vehicle. (Tr. 30\u00ad\n31.) A credit report from June 2022 reflects no delinquent debts.

Or. 10865 \u00a7 2. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge \napplies these guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \n\u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 15-01253 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2016). \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts.

A person who is financially \nirresponsible may also be irresponsible, unconcerned, or negligent in handling and \nsafeguarding classified information. See ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, \n2012). \nApplicant\u2019s admissions and the evidence submitted at the hearing establishes the \ndisqualifying condition in AG \u00b6 19(f): \u201cfailure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, \nstate, or local income tax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax as required.\u201d \nAlthough Applicant has a history of delinquent debts, including debts for federal \nand state income taxes, the non-tax debts were old, and his most recent credit report \nreflected no delinquent debts. The DCSA CAF apparently concluded that any security \nconcerns based on those debts were mitigated, and they were not alleged in the SOR. \nTherefore, his history of non-tax debts may not be the basis for denying his application \nfor a security clearance, but it may be considered to assess his credibility; to decide \nwhether a particular adjudicative guideline is applicable; to evaluate evidence of \nextenuation, mitigation, or changed circumstances; to consider whether he has \ndemonstrated successful rehabilitation; or as part of a whole-person analysis. ISCR Case \nNo. 03-20327 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, 2006). \nThe following mitigating conditions are potentially applicable: \nAG \u00b6 20(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not \ncast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \nAG \u00b6 20(b): the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(c): the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling \nfor the problem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit \ncredit counseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem \nis being resolved or is under control; and \nAG \u00b6 20(g): the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax \nauthority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \nAG \u00b6 20(a) is not established. Applicant\u2019s tax delinquencies are recent, frequent, \nand did not occur under circumstances making recurrence unlikely. \nAG \u00b6 20(b) is not established. Applicant\u2019s failures to timely file his federal and state \ntax returns were the result of his financial mismanagement and his conscious decision in \n2010 to not file his tax returns. \nAG \u00b6 20(c) is not fully established. Applicant obtained the services of a tax \nprofessional in 2018, but his tax problems are not yet under control. \nAG \u00b6 20(g) is established for the years for which the returns have been filed. When \nApplicant responded to DOHA interrogatories in December 2019, he had not yet filed his \nfederal returns for 2010 through 2015. He did not file his federal return for 2016 until April \n2019. He provided documentation that he had filed his state returns for 2014 through \n2018, but his documentation does not reflect when those state returns were filed. As of \nDecember 2019, he had not filed his state returns for 2011, 2012, and 2013. \nThe fact that Applicant has filed some of his past-due returns \u201cdoes not preclude \ncareful consideration of Applicant\u2019s security worthiness based on longstanding prior \nbehavior evidencing irresponsibility.\u201d ISCR Case No. 12-05053 (App. Bd.

An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process \nfactors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \nI have incorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis \nand applied the adjudicative factors in AG \u00b6 2(d).

The DOD CAF took the action under Executive Order \n(EO) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as \namended; and DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance \nReview Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive) and the National Security \nAdjudicative Guidelines (AG), effective June 8, 2017. \nOn March 12, 2021, Applicant answered the SOR, denying the allegations.

(Tr. 7) \nI then received six Government exhibits (GE 1 \u2013 GE  6), nine Applicant exhibits (AE 1 \u2013 \nAE 9), and considered the testimony of Applicant and a psychologist who evaluated him. \nAt the close of the hearing, the parties made a joint motion to hold the decision in \nabeyance to allow the Government to schedule another mental health evaluation of \nApplicant. Applicant\u2019s counsel also moved to allow for additional time for Applicant to \nobtain a mental health evaluation from a psychologist of Applicant\u2019s choice.

She did not object to the admissibility of the psychological report prepared by \nApplicant\u2019s psychologist. In addition, she moved to amend the Statement of Reasons \n(SOR) to add subparagraph 1.b, which states, as follows: \nIn December 2021, you were evaluated by a licensed psychologist and were \ndiagnosed with (1) social pragmatic communication disorder vs. autism \nspectrum disorder, (2) bipolar II disorder, per documentation, and (3) \nunspecified anxiety disorder, per documentation.

Based on this information, the psychologist \ndetermined that: (1) your judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness are \nquestionable, (2) you pose a risk to national security if you possess a \nsecurity clearance, and (3) your prognosis is guarded. \n2 \n\n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s counsel did not object to Department Counsel\u2019s proposed amendment, \nwhereupon, I granted Department Counsel\u2019s motion. \nCounsel for Applicant moved to dismiss SOR subparagraph 1(a), or in the \nalternative, find for applicant \u201cfor being an incorrect/stale/unreliable finding.\u201d In a post-\nhearing Order, I reserved judgment on this motion until the issuance of the Decision. (HE \nI) Before issuance of the Decision, Department Counsel contacted me to inform me that \nshe had no objection to striking SOR subparagraph 1.a. Consequently, I granted \nApplicant\u2019s Counsel\u2019s motion, and struck subparagraph 1.a from the record. The \ntranscript (Tr.) was received on October 26, 2021. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant is a 31-year-old, single man. He earned an associate\u2019s degree in \nelectrical engineering and computer engineering in 2014, and he earned a bachelor\u2019s \ndegree in computer networking in 2016. (Tr. 78) Since 2017, he has been working for a \ndefense contractor as a technical writer. (GE 2 at 7) In August 2010, Applicant received \na two-year appointment to the position of student trainee at a government agency. (GE 5 \nat 1) Per the terms of the appointment, Applicant was eligible to be hired full time after \ncompleting the internship. \nOn July 21, 2011, at an off-site party that Applicant\u2019s agency organized for their \ninterns, Applicant and some fellow interns discussed the imminent visit to a local college \nby the President of the United States (POTUS). (GE 4 at 1) During the conversation, \nApplicant said that security would not be stringent enough to protect the president \nbecause there were multiple ways to make homemade bombs that could be used against \nhim. He then retrieved his personal laptop to show the other interns a manual about how \nto make explosives. (GE 4 at 1) \nThe following month, the base police where Applicant and the interns worked \nreceived a complaint about Applicant\u2019s comments at the party, which prompted an \ninvestigation. (GE 4 at 1) The U.S. Secret Service were briefed on the incident. The base \ninvestigators interviewed Applicant who advised that he was not threatening the base, the \npresident, or anyone else, and was just interested in chemistry and explosives. Applicant \nagreed to a forensic examination and review of his laptop computer. The subsequent \ninspection found several files related to weapons, but \u201cno notable files . . . identified which \nindicate[d] an aspiration to construct explosive devices or indicate a threat against a \nperson or structure.\u201d (GE 4 at 2) \nThe investigator also interviewed the student interns at the party who had engaged \nin the conversation with Applicant. (GE 4 at 1) Per the investigator, \u201cno one perceived \n[Applicant\u2019s] comments or actions as threatening or as a specified threat to POTUS or a \ngovernment facility.\u201d (GE 4 at 2) Applicant\u2019s supervisor was interviewed. He told the \ninvestigator that Applicant \u201cwas not believed to be a threat, due to his involvement in \nconducting mathematical data and inert explosives after testing as part of his work \n3 \n\n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \nI \nassisting . . . various programs\u201d at work.

(GE 4 at 2) \nApplicant completed the internship that summer. (GE 2 at 7) In November 2011, \nApplicant e-mailed his employer and asked about work over the holiday break. (GE D) In \nan e-mail response, Applicant\u2019s employer replied, \u201cI just want to inform you that we don\u2019t \nhave any work for you this winter[,] and that we would not be able to bring you back at \nthis time.\u201d (GE D) Applicant then received a closeout packet with instructions on \ntransferring his thrift savings plan, and instructions on how to return his CAC card. (Tr. \n85) Applicant\u2019s former supervisor then called him. During their conversation, the \nsupervisor did not say anything to give Applicant a reason to think that he was terminated \nfor any reason other than that which was stated in the email. (Tr. 86) \nSix years later, during an investigative interview, the investigative agent confronted \nApplicant about the circumstances of his departure from the 2011 internship, alleging that \nhe was terminated for making inappropriate comments which caused other employees to \nfeel uncomfortable working with him. (GE 2 at 6) Applicant denied this allegation, \ncontending that he did not recall making any inappropriate comments to coworkers, and \nthat he never received any follow-up correspondence about the circumstances of his \ntermination after receiving the November 2011 e-mail, as referenced above. (GE 2 at 6; \nTr. 87) He has come to understand since the 2017 investigative interview that the \ncomments that precipitated the base police investigation contributed to his dismissal. (Tr. \n110) \nThe record evidence contains a termination letter, dated December 1, 2011, \nreferencing inappropriate comments to other employees. (GE 5) Its certification of receipt \nblock is unsigned and undated. (GE 5 at 2) \nThe Government initiated Applicant\u2019s current security clearance investigative \nprocess in 2017. (GE 1 at 1) As part of the process, Applicant was referred to a \npsychologist for an evaluation \u201cto clarify his current mental health status.\u201d (GE 3 at 5) \nAfter a one-hour interview, she characterized him as \u201can eccentric, self-absorbed man \nwith poor social skills.\u201d (GE 3 at 5) Moreover, when he denied making inappropriate \ncomments at his internship, she characterized him as \u201cblindly unaware and uncritical of \nany faults or imperfections,\u201d and concluded that this was \u201cextremely concerning.\u201d (GE 3 \nat 6) Ultimately, she concluded that his behavior cast doubt on his judgement, reliability, \nand trustworthiness. (GE 3) \nThe psychologist also criticized Applicant for being \u201cextremely guarded about the \ndetails of his internship\u201d during the evaluation. (GE 3 at 5) She interviewed Applicant in a \ncaf\u00e9 at a bookstore with several patrons sitting at tables nearby. (Tr. 53, 55) Failure to \nconduct psychological evaluations in a private setting is a violation of a psychologist\u2019s \nethical obligation to ensure privacy and confidentiality during consultations.

(Tr. 43) \nIn August 2021, two years after Applicant was evaluated by the psychologist at the \nbookstore caf\u00e9, he was evaluated by a licensed clinical social worker (LCSW). (GE A) \nShe conducted the evaluation in a secured, encrypted, video teleconference platform to \nensure confidentiality. (AE A at 2) The session lasted four hours. She concluded that \nApplicant had \u201ca strong indication of Asperger\u2019s syndrome, a neurodevelopmental \ndisorder characterized by significant difficulties in social interaction and nonverbal \ncommunication. (AE A at 10) Being homeschooled, without the benefits of typical \nchildhood socialization and group dynamics, may have exacerbated his problems with \nsocial interactions. (AE A at 10) She concluded that his disorder \u201cdoes not have any \nmedical, psychological, psychiatric, emotional, or substance use conditions which would \nimpair his judgment, reliability, or trustworthiness.\u201d (AE A at 15) She recommended that \nhe attend therapy to work on his conversational skills. (Tr. 120) Applicant followed her \nadvice, and has been attending therapy once per week since the social worker\u2019s \nevaluation. (Tr. 101, 104) \nAt the Government\u2019s request, Applicant was examined by another psychologist on \nDecember 11, 2021. After reviewing the available records and analyzing psychological \ntest results the psychologist diagnosed Applicant with the following: \nSocial pragmatic communication disorder vs. autism spectrum disorder; \nBipolar II disorder . . . [and]; \nUnspecified anxiety disorder. (GE 7 at 6) \nBased on this information, the psychologist determined that Applicant\u2019s judgment, \nreliability, and trustworthiness are questionable, that he posed a risk to national security \nif granted a security clearance, and that his prognosis was guarded. (GE 7 at 6) In \nreaching this conclusion, she relied, in part, on controverted allegations, not included in \nthe SOR, from unidentified coworkers on a job where he worked more than ten years ago. \nMoreover, her report does not reflect the conclusion of the base police investigation \nbecause she never received it. \nOn December 31, 2021, Applicant was evaluated by a psychologist that he retained. \n(AE L) Before the evaluation, she conducted a comprehensive, three-day assessment on \nNovember 1, November 2, and December 31, 2021. The psychologist diagnosed \nApplicant with bipolar disorder and unspecified anxiety disorder. She recommended that \nhe participate in weekly individual therapy for managing depressive episodes, and in role-\nplaying or practicing conversational skills. (AE L at 8) \nAccording to Applicant\u2019s company\u2019s human resource director, with whom he has \nworked since 2017, he is \u201can extremely intelligent, loyal, and appreciated part of [the] \n5 \n\n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nteam [who] understands business rules and policy, asks questions when unsure of \nsomething, and never hesitates to contribute where he can or educate himself if it benefits \nthe company and/or the client.\u201d (AE I) Applicant has received multiple verbal \ncommendations and e-mail commendations from persons involved with projects that he \nhas worked with over the years since beginning his current job in 2017. (Tr. 82) \nSOR subparagraph 2.b alleges that Applicant falsified Section 13A of his 2017 \nsecurity clearance application by not providing the reason for leaving the internship in \n2011. Applicant testified that he was never informed that he was fired for cause. (Tr. 85), \nSOR subparagraph 2.c alleges that Applicant falsified the circumstances \nsurrounding the base police investigation. Applicant told the investigator that two base \npolice officers came to his place of employment two days after the intern party, and asked \nto search his laptop. (GE 2 at 8) Also, they interviewed him and asked if he had an interest \nin any terrorist activity or other improper behavior. Subject answered, \u201cno,\u201d and the \nsubsequent laptop search revealed nothing derogatory, whereupon, it was returned. (GE \n2 at 9) \n Policies \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion the Executive \nBranch has in regulating access to information pertaining to national security, \nemphasizing that \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy \nv. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). When evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security \nclearance, the administrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are required to be \nconsidered in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of \nhuman behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the \nadjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overall adjudicative goal is a fair, \nimpartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a \nconscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d \nThe administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the \nperson, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present \nevidence to establish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, \nthe applicant is responsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, \nexplain, extenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department \n6 \n\n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nCounsel. . . .\u201d The applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable \nsecurity decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation about potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Section 7 of Executive \nOrder 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall \nin no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See also EO \n12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access to classified or sensitive \ninformation). \nAnalysis \nGuideline E: Personal Conduct \nUnder this guideline, \u201cconduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, \ndishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified or sensitive \ninformation.\u201d Moreover, of special interest is any failure to provide truthful and candid \nanswers during the national security investigative process. (Id.) \nThe SOR originally alleged that Applicant was terminated from his internship in \n2011 for implying a threat to kill the POTUS and showing employees how to make bombs \non his laptop computer. This allegation proved to be unsupported by the Government\u2019s \nrecord evidence, as an investigation concluded that no threats had been made, nor had \nany criminal violations occurred. This prompted the Government to strike from the SOR \nany references to threats or bomb making, and to amend the SOR to allege that Applicant \nwas terminated from his job for conducting himself in an inappropriate manner, and \nmaking inappropriate comments that caused his coworkers to feel uncomfortable working \nwith him. \nThis amended SOR allegation is problematic for two reasons. First, although SOR \nallegations do not have to be drafted with the specificity of criminal pleadings, they must, \nat minimum, be drafted in such a manner that the applicant can prepare a response. \n(ISCR Case No. 00-0633.a1 (October 23, 2003) at 3) Subparagraph 2.a does not meet \nthis threshold because it does not specify the allegedly inappropriate conduct or \ncomments that are at issue. Secondly, these allegations are controverted, as Applicant \nadmits making the comments that triggered the investigation, but was unaware of any \ncomments he made while working at his internship made others feel uncomfortable. \n7 \n\n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nUnder these circumstances, subject to exceptions that are not present in this case, the \nGovernment must identify the witnesses who made these alleged statements and make \nthem available for cross examination. (Directive \u00b6 E3.1.22; ISCR Case No. 05-10921 \n(April 19, 2007 at 1) Applicant not only was not afforded this opportunity, the Government \nhas not specified the allegations or otherwise given him notice of what the allegations \nwere, or who made them. \nAssuming for the sake of argument that subparagraph 2.a is a tenable allegation, \nand that the termination letter in the record evidence is sufficient to establish the \nGovernment\u2019s initial burden of proof, AG \u00b6 16(d)(2), \u201cany . . . inappropriate behavior,\u201d \napplies, but is mitigated by AG \u00b6 17(f), \u201cthe information was unsubstantiated or from a \nsource of questionable reliability.\u201d I resolve SOR subparagraph 2.a in Applicant\u2019s favor. \nAs for subparagraph 2.b, Applicant received an email from his supervisor that the \nagency would not be bringing him back for the following summer, but never received any \nnotice that he was being terminated. Under these circumstances, I conclude that he did \nnot intentionally make a false statement as alleged in subparagraph 2.b, and I resolve it \nin his favor. \nSubparagraph 2.c alleges that Applicant deliberately failed to disclose the reason \nfor the 2011 investigation when an investigative agent from the Office of Personnel \nManagement interviewed him in 2017, \u201cthereby deliberately fail[ing] to disclose that \ninformation as set forth in subparagraph 2.a, above.\u201d Applicant did tell the investigator \nthat the NCIS agent asked him if he was interested in any terrorist activity. Moreover, \nApplicant\u2019s security clearance interview occurred after NCIS had cleared him of any \nwrongdoing related to comments made at an intern party in 2011. Consequently, there \nwas no intent to mislead or deceive the investigator.

(GE \n7 at 6) This evaluation triggers the application of AG \u00b6 28(b), \u201can opinion by a duly \nqualified mental health professional that the individual has a condition that may impair \njudgment, stability, reliability, or trustworthiness.\u201d \n8 \n\n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nIn reaching this conclusion, the psychologist relied, in part, on controverted \nallegations, not included in the SOR, from unidentified coworkers on a job where \nApplicant worked more than ten years ago. Moreover, her report does not reflect the \nconclusion of the base police investigation because she never received it. Consequently, \nthe probative value of the report is limited. \nApplicant has been working for the same employer since 2017. There is no record \nof any negative job history in that time, and he is, in fact, well-respected by his colleagues \nand clients. Applicant acknowledges that he has a mental health disorder and is in \nongoing therapy to address this issue. Under these circumstances, the mitigating \ncondition set forth in AG \u00b6 29(e), \u201cthere is no indication of a current problem,\u201d applies. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must consider the \ntotality of an applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant circumstances in light of the nine \nadjudicative process factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). They are as follows: \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; \n(2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation;  \n(3) the frequency and recency of the conduct;  \n(4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct;  \n(5) the extent to which participation is voluntary;  \n(6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent \nbehavioral changes;  \n(7) the motivation for the conduct; and \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nThe Government did not specify the inappropriate conduct and comments that \nApplicant made, and he denies them. Conversely, although Applicant was initially \nunaware that he was terminated for cause, he now does not dispute this. Nevertheless, \nhis termination and its corresponding surrounding circumstances occurred more than ten \nyears ago when Applicant was in college. Since then, he has earned an associate degree, \na bachelor\u2019s degree, and he has gained a full-time job where he is currently excelling. In \nsum, there is no indication of a current problem. Under these circumstances, I conclude \nApplicant has mitigated the security concerns. \n9 \n\n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________ \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline I: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.b:  \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline E: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 2.a \u2013 2.c:  \n \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly \nconsistent with the interests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

He attended high school from 1998 until 2002 but did not earn a diploma. In 2016, he received a certificate in aviation mechanics. He also attended classes full time at two other trade schools between 2014 and 2017, but did not earn a certificate or degree. He served on active duty with the U.S. Air Force for about 10 years until 2013 when he received a general discharge under honorable conditions. He received this discharge because he was charged with driving under the influence of alcohol in February 2013. He was twice deployed to combat zones during his military service. He was married in 2008 and divorced in 2013. He has been living with a cohabitant since 2016 and has been engaged to marry her as of late 2021. He has five children with three different women. At least four of his children are minors for whom he is financially responsible. He was unemployed from about 2013 until January 2018. He briefly held one temporary job for about four months in 2015.

These delinquencies consist of child support payments (SOR \n\u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b), an automobile loan (SOR \u00b6 1.c), a government overpayment (SOR \u00b6 \n1.d), and telecommunications debts (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.e, 1.f, and 1.g). Approximately $69,000 \nof the delinquent debt in the SOR is for unpaid child support in State A and State B. \nApplicant admitted the SOR debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b and 1.e through 1.g, with \nadditional comment. He denied the SOR debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c and 1.d. His admissions \nare adopted as findings of fact.

Applicant testified that he brought these accounts current through \npayments and by taking custody of the two children for whom the payments were \nprovided after his ex-wife passed away in April 2021. Both State A and State B forgave \nany back child support owed in 2021 when Applicant took sole custody of the two \nchildren. Applicant provided documentary evidence from States A and B that these \naccounts are current.

He believed his ex-wife was responsible for this loan. He testified that she \ntook the car after their divorce, but in his 2018 clearance interview, he stated that he \nwas in possession of the vehicle that secured the debt when it was repossessed. He did \nnot initially try to make payment arrangement on this debt because he believed his ex-\nwife was responsible for it. After learning that he was responsible for the debt, in 2016 \nor 2017, he claimed that he contacted the creditor but he could not afford to make the \npayments they were requiring, so he gave up. He presented no documentary evidence \nthat he has made a payment, disputed this debt, offered or negotiated a payment \nagreement, or taken any significant actions to resolve this debt.

However, he \nsubsequently testified that this debt was likely for an overpayment for moving expenses \nwhile he was still in the military. He claimed that he contacted his former military base \nseveral times in 2013 after he became aware of the debt to resolve it, but no one could \nhelp him with a resolution, so he stopped trying. Given that he took these efforts to \nresolve the debt in 2013, he must have been aware of it during his clearance interview, \nwhen he responded to the SOR, and at hearing. Regardless, he presented no \ndocumentary evidence that he has made a payment, disputed this debt, offered or \nnegotiated a payment agreement, or taken any significant actions to resolve this debt. \nThe debt appears on the 2017 and 2019 credit reports, but not on the 2021 and 2022 \ncredit reports.

His fianc\u00e9e was recently laid off, is looking for another job, and is in \nthe process of applying for unemployment benefits.

He has not received any financial counseling. (Tr.47-\n49, 56-57; GE 2) \nApplicant presented two character-reference letters. One was from a co-worker \nand the other from a long-time friend. The friend holds a security clearance and works \nfor a U.S. Senator as a military/veteran liaison. Both of these individuals think Applicant \nshould be entrusted with a security clearance and cite to how well he takes care of his \nchildren and his understanding of the importance of family.

In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n1 Any adverse information not alleged in the SOR, such as Applicant\u2019s two additional delinquent debts \ncannot be used for disqualification purposes. It may be considered when assessing the application of \nmitigating conditions and for the whole-person analysis. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant had several delinquent debts that went unresolved for many years. \nSeveral of these debts remain unresolved. The evidence is sufficient to raise AG \u00b6\u00b6 \n19(a) and 19(c), thereby shifting the burden to Applicant to provide evidence in \nmitigation. \nConditions that could mitigate the financial considerations security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 20. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances;   \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \nApplicant attributed his financial problems to a difficult divorce in 2013 and \nunemployment from 2013 until 2018. These causes were beyond his control. \nThere is documentary corroboration that the child support debts alleged in SOR \n\u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b have been resolved through payment and Applicant taking custody of \ntwo of his two children. SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b are concluded for Applicant, as AG \u00b6 20(b) \nand AG \u00b6 20(d) apply. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \nNone of the other SOR debts are mitigated. Applicant claimed that he does not \nthink he owes the debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.e through 1.h because he thinks he either paid \nthese debts or came to an alternative agreement with the creditor without payment. \nHowever, he provided no documentary proof of payment or this alternative agreement. \nIt is reasonable to expect Applicant to present documentation about the resolution of \nspecific debts. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 15-03363 at 2 (App. Bd. Oct. 16, 2016). \nApplicant denied owing the SOR debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c and 1.d. He thought his ex-\nwife was responsible for the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.c, but he provided no documented proof to \nsubstantiate this basis of dispute or evidence of his actions to resolve the debt. He \nclaimed that the government had not properly communicated to him that he was \nresponsible for the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.d, but admitted at hearing that he knew about the \ndebt in 2013, tried to resolve if for a couple of months, but then gave up. Therefore, his \nbasis for disputing this debt is not supported by the evidence and is not reasonable. \nSeveral of Applicant\u2019s debts appear on earlier credit reports, but not subsequent \nones. However, the fact that a debt no longer appears on a credit report does not \nestablish any meaningful, independent evidence as to the disposition of the debt. ISCR \nCase No. 14-03612 at 3 (App. Bd. Aug. 25, 2015). Additionally, as there is more than \none plausible explanation for the absence of debts from a credit report, such as the \nremoval of debts due to the passage of time, the absence of unsatisfied debts from an \napplicant\u2019s credit report does not extenuate or mitigate a history of financial difficulties \nor constitute evidence of financial reform or rehabilitation. ISCR Case No. 15-02957 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Feb. 17, 2017). \nWhile Applicant ultimately settled these debts just prior to the hearing, he \nbecame delinquent on two additional debts after the SOR was issued. These new \ndelinquencies, combined with his unresolved SOR debts show that his financial issues \nare ongoing. These delinquencies also fail to show that his financial issues are unlikely \nto recur. Applicant\u2019s failure to provide adequate proof that he has resolved the majority \nof his SOR debts and his additional delinquencies show that his financial issues are \nongoing and continue to cast doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, and good \njudgment. The financial considerations security concern is not mitigated. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n(1) The nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                      \n                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. I have also considered \nApplicant\u2019s positive character references, his military service, and his deployments. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude Applicant did not \nmitigate the financial considerations security concern. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.b: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.c-1.g:   \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIt is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for \na security clearance.

He reported the debt on a Questionnaire for \nNational Security Positions (SF 86) he submitted in January 2019, with the comment: \n\u201cpaying off the obligation at $69.11/month.\u201d He told an investigator during his June 2019 \ninterview that he believed the account had been satisfied. He repeated that claim during \na telephonic follow-up interview in July 2019. (Tr. at 50-53; Applicant\u2019s response to \nSOR; GE 1, 2) \nApplicant testified that the debt was sold to a collection company in 2019.

He \u201crefused to do either out of security \nconcerns.\u201d His position is: \u201cif they want their money, they can jolly well send us any of \nthat and we\u2019ll gladly reinstitute payments.\u201d The letter from the collection company has \nan 800 number and a website that accepts payments.

The bank holding the loan issued an Internal Revenue Service \n(IRS) Form 1099-C (Cancellation of Debt) in 2019, which cancelled Applicant\u2019s $13,885 \ndebt. Applicant asserted that they were paying the loan, as evidenced by the $13,885 \nfigure as opposed to $25,573. However, creditors are not obligated to include interest, \nand if they do, it is required to be reported.1 The 1099-C did not report any interest. (Tr. \nat 57-63; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 2, 3; AE L) \nApplicant and his wife have received financial counseling. She handles the \nfamily\u2019s finances.

In addition to his salary, he receives Social Security benefits and the pay for \nbeing an adjunct professor at two law schools and a college.

He attested to Applicant\u2019s \nexcellent job performance and strong moral character. He recommended Applicant for a \nsecurity clearance. (Tr. at 17-41) \nPolicies \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG), which became \neffective on June 8, 2017. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; \n(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant has a history of delinquent debts and financial problems. The evidence \nindicates that it was initially difficult for him to pay his debts, but he could pay the debts \nat some point, he just chose not to. AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a), 19(b), and 19(c) are applicable. \nConditions that could mitigate the financial considerations security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 20. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment;  \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control; \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \nApplicant\u2019s financial problems related primarily to caring for his parents and his \nparents-in-law and compensation issues at his previous employer. However, those \nissues ended more than four years ago. Whatever minimal security concerns raised by \nthe two small unidentified medical debts are mitigated. As for the other SOR debts, \nApplicant is credited with paying a total of $77. I do not believe that multiple creditors \nsimply stopped making efforts to receive his payments. Applicant is not necessarily \nlying, as almost all of the information about his finances was relayed to him by his wife. \nIn any regard, he is ultimately responsible for his finances, and he abrogated his \nresponsibility to pay his creditors. The facts that one of the creditors cancelled its debt \nand none of the debts are listed on the most recent credit report provide little mitigation. \nSee, e.g., ISCR Case No. 14-03612 at 3 (App. Bd. Aug. 15, 2015). \nI am unable to find that Applicant acted responsibly under the circumstances or \nthat he made a good-faith effort to pay his debts. His financial issues cast doubt on his \ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. None of the mitigating conditions \nare applicable. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. I also considered Applicant\u2019s \ncommendable service in the Coast Guard Auxiliary and his favorable character \nevidence. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude Applicant did not \nmitigate the financial considerations security concerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.c: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.d-1.e: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.f: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIt is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for \na security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nEdward W. Loughran \nAdministrative Judge \n7 \n",

Applicant admitted \nto all of the debts, and stated that he was working with a finance specialist/credit repair \nagent. During his testimony, Applicant claimed that he employed a credit repair company, \nbut provided no documentary evidence of such service or results. He stated that he is \nalso working with a family friend to help resolve debts, but he has not provided any funds \nto the friend for such purposes. The evidence submitted by the Government supports all \nof the SOR allegations. \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a - 1.c are vehicle loan accounts. Applicant bought a BMW while \nstationed in Germany, that was repossessed in less than one year from its purchase. \nAnother vehicle, a GMC Yukon, was also repossessed in less than one year of ownership. \nA third vehicle, a Chrysler 300 purchased in 2017, was defaulted in 2018 and \nrepossessed in 2019. All three bank loans were charged off in 2015, 2017, and 2018. \nApplicant has taken no action to address these debts. Applicant used a hardship loan to \npurchase his current vehicle. \nSOR \u00b6 1.d is a military star card account. Applicant testified that he has been \npaying the account through an involuntary garnishment from his military retirement pay. \nHe did not provide evidence of such garnishment, and his 2022 credit bureau report \n(CBR) shows the collection account as active, but does not reflect the garnishment. \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.e and 1.f are credit card accounts that have been charged off and remain \nin a collection status.

As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 2. \nNational security eligibility is predicated upon the applicant meeting the criteria \ncontained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. \nInstead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge applies \nthese guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative \njudge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider a person\u2019s stability, trustworthiness, reliability, \ndiscretion, character, honesty, and judgment. AG \u00b6 1(b). \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \n\u00a7 7.

The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \u201cSubstantial \nevidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. Washington \nMetro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines presume a \nnexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria listed \ntherein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 12-01295 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Jan. 20, 2015). \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, \nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. \n02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01- \n20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see, AG \u00b6 1(d). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nThe security concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. . . .  \nThe relevant disqualifying conditions under AG \u00b6 19 include: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant\u2019s admissions, testimony, and the documentary evidence in the record \nare sufficient to establish the disqualifying conditions AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and (c). \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \nThe following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially relevant: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay\noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue. \nApplicant has a history of not responsibly meeting financial obligations. He has \ndone little to address his habit of incurring debts for which he cannot pay, or to take \nappropriate action to investigate and resolve delinquent debts. The guideline \nencompasses concerns about a person\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities \nessential to protecting classified information. A person who is financially irresponsible \nmay also be irresponsible, unconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding \nclassified information. See ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \nThere is insufficient evidence for a determination that Applicant\u2019s financial \nproblems will be resolved within a reasonable period and that he can obtain and maintain \na measure of financial responsibility. His financial issues continue to cast doubt on his \ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. \nOverall, Applicant\u2019s financial responsibility is questionable. He has been slow to \nrespond to the financial issues raised in the SOR, only showing payment of two minor \ndebts after his hearing. Applicant\u2019s meager efforts were too late to establish financial \nresponsibility and a reliable track record of debt resolution. No mitigation credit fully \napplies except for SOR debts \u00b6\u00b6 1.g \u2013 1.j, that have been resolved. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n_______________________ \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder AG \u00b6\u00b6 2(a), 2(c), and 2(d), the ultimate determination of whether to grant \nnational security eligibility must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. Under the whole-person \nconcept, the administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security \nclearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process \nfactors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d). \nI considered all of the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my findings of fact \nand comments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. I also considered \nApplicant\u2019s military service, divorce, and child-support responsibilities. I remain \nunconvinced of his overall financial responsibility, efforts to resolve delinquent debts, and \nhis ability, intent, and desire to meet his financial obligations in the future. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nAgainst Applicant \nFor Applicant \n  Subparagraphs 1.a - 1.f: \n  Subparagraphs 1.g - 1.j: \nConclusion \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national security interest of the \nUnited States to grant Applicant eligibility for access to classified information.

(Tr. 48-51, 66-67; GE 1-2) \nDepartment Counsel acknowledged that the gravamen of this case was \nApplicant\u2019s relationship with her parents who live in the PRC, not with the seven \nunnamed friends alleged in the SOR. Applicant testified that she had lost contact with all \nher friends years ago. She only has once-a-year contact with a cousin. Based upon the \nlack of specificity regarding the friends in question, and the paucity of evidence \nregarding Applicant\u2019s contact with these friends, I find for Applicant on SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c and \n1.d. (Tr. 14, 40, 53) \nApplicant wanted to come to the United States as a young child. Her father\nshared in her dream to immigrate to the United States. She believes the PRC is a \ncorrupt government that prevents freedom of speech. The reason she enlisted in the \nArmy in 2015, even though she held a master\u2019s degree in engineering, is because she \nwas told by a friend that enlisting could lead to earlier citizenship for her through the \nMilitary Accessions Vital to the National Interest (MAVNI) program. (MAVNI allows \ncertain non-citizens to join the U.S. military and apply for immediate citizenship. See \n \nstilt.com/blog/2021/06/mavni-program/) She used this program to gain early citizenship. \nShe also wanted to become a doctor. (Tr. 36-38, 41) \nApplicant owns a home outright in the United States that is valued at \napproximately $450,000. She has cash in bank accounts in the amount of \napproximately $100,000. Her retirement account contains approximately $36,000. Her \ncurrent salary is approximately $107,000. Her VA disability payment is approximately \n$3,000 monthly. Since coming to the United States, she has traveled back to the PRC \nonly once in 2018 to visit family. She has no intentions to return to the PRC in the \nfuture. Applicant owns no property in the PRC. She is involved in her community.

(Tr. 30-34; AE F) \nPeople\u2019s Republic of China  \nThe PRC has an authoritarian government, dominated by the Chinese \nCommunist Party. The PRC has a poor record with respect to human rights, suppresses \npolitical dissent, and its practices include arbitrary arrest and detention, forced \nconfessions, torture, and mistreatment of prisoners. Repression and coercion, \nparticularly against organizations and individuals involved in rights advocacy and public \ninterest issues, are routine. (HE III) \nAlong with Russia, the PRC is the most aggressive country in targeting sensitive \nand protected U.S. technology, and economic intelligence. It has targeted the U.S. with \nactive intelligence gathering programs, both legal and illegal. In China, authorities have \nmonitored telephone conversations, facsimile transmissions, e-mail, text messaging, \nand internet communications. Authorities opened and censored mail. The security \nservices routinely monitored and entered residences and offices to gain access to \ncomputers, telephones, and fax machines. All major hotels had a sizable internal \nsecurity presence, and hotel guestrooms were sometimes bugged and searched for \nsensitive or proprietary materials. (HE III) \nAs recently as July 2020, PRC consulate employees helped PLA officers evade \nand obstruct U.S. law enforcement activities to conceal their military affiliations. Multiple \nU.S. criminal indictments since 2015 involve PRC nationals, naturalized U.S. citizens, or \npermanent resident aliens from the PRC, and U.S. citizens, procuring and exporting \ncontrolled items to China. (HE III) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(a), the entire process is a careful weighing of a number of variables known as the \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk that an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline B, Foreign Influence \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for foreign influence is set out in AG \n\u00b6 7: \nForeign contacts and interests, including, but not limited to, business, \nfinancial, and property interests, are a national security concern if they \nresult in divided allegiance. They may also be a national security concern \nif they create circumstances in which the individual may be manipulated or \ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a \nway inconsistent with U.S. interests or otherwise made vulnerable to \npressure or coercion by any foreign interest. Assessment of foreign \ncontacts and interests should consider the country in which the foreign \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ncontact or interest is located, including, but not limited to, considerations \nsuch as whether it is known to target U.S. citizens to obtain classified or \nsensitive information or is associated with a risk of terrorism. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 7. Two are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) contact, regardless of method, with a foreign family member, business \nor professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or \nresident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of \nforeign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; and \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual's obligation to \nprotect classified or sensitive information or technology and the \nindividual's desire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing \nthat information or technology. \nApplicant\u2019s mother and father are residents and citizens of the PRC. Her mother \nworked as a physician for the PLA for over 25 years and continues to receive a pension \nfrom that work. She also currently works at a PLA hospital. Her father works for a PRC-\nowned airline. Applicant is very close to her parents as reflected by their weekly \ncommunications and her parents\u2019 willingness to help her financially. Because of these \nfacts, there exists a heightened risk of foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, \npressure, and coercion. The same situation also creates a potential conflict of interest \nfor Applicant. AG \u00b6\u00b6 7(a) and 7(b) have been raised by the evidence. \nConditions that could mitigate foreign influence security concerns are provided \nunder AG \u00b6 8: \n(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in \nwhich these persons are located, or the positions or activities of those \npersons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be \nplaced in a position of having to choose between the interests of a foreign \nindividual, group, organization, or government and the interests of the \nUnited States; and \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual's sense of \nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, or allegiance to the group, \ngovernment, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such deep and \nlongstanding relationships and loyalties in the United States, that the \nindividual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the \nU.S. interest.  \nBased upon the documented action of the PRC in attempting to gain intelligence \nfrom U.S. sources, the evidence does not support that it is unlikely that Applicant could \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \nbe placed in a position to choose between the interests of her family in the PRC and \nthose of the United States. Additionally, her mother\u2019s affiliation with the PLA, and her \nparent\u2019s dependence on their PRC\u2019s government pensions, place Applicant in a \nsusceptible position. Applicant has established ties to the United States. However, it is \ndifficult to determine, based upon the evidence, that she has a deep and longstanding \nrelation with the United States, such that she would resolve all conflicts in favor of the \nUnited States should the PRC pressure her parents living in China. As stated above, the \nprotection of the national security is the paramount consideration and any doubt must \nbe resolved in favor of national security. I am unable to find either of the mitigating \nconditions to be fully applicable. Despite the presence of some mitigation, it is \ninsufficient to overcome the significant security concerns that exist. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nThe PRC has an authoritarian government, a bad human rights record, and a \nvery aggressive espionage program aimed at the United States. The nature of a \nnation\u2019s government, its relationship with the United States, and its human rights record \nare relevant in assessing the likelihood that an applicant\u2019s family members are \nvulnerable to government coercion. The risk of coercion, persuasion, or duress is \nsignificantly greater if the foreign country has an authoritarian government, a family \nmember is associated with or dependent upon the government, or the country is known \nto conduct intelligence operations against the United States. Here, the PRC checks all \nthe blocks. There is no reason to question Applicant\u2019s loyalty and devotion to this \ncountry. However, she has not overcome the vulnerability to pressure, coercion, \nexploitation, and duress created by her relatives living in the PRC and her mother\u2019s \nsignificant close connection to the PLA. \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nApplicant has done nothing whatsoever to question her loyalty and devotion to \nthis country. In fact, her decision to serve in the U.S. Army was admirable, even if it was \ncut short by her mental health condition. However, she has simply been unable to \novercome the heavy burden of showing that she is not subject to influence by the PRC, \nthrough her parents living in China. Her vulnerability to foreign pressure, coercion, \nexploitation, or duress remains a concern. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant has not mitigated the foreign influence security concerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline B:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.b: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.c \u2013 1.d: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

I convened the hearing as scheduled on February 10, 2022. \nDuring the hearing, Government exhibits (GE) 1 through GE 3, and Applicant \nexhibits (AE) A through AE E were admitted into evidence without objection. Applicant \ntestified. The transcript (Tr.) was received on February 18, 2022. I kept the record open \nto enable Applicant to supplement it with documentation that was identified during the \nhearing. He took advantage of that opportunity and timely submitted two documents \nwhich were marked and admitted as AE F and AE G without objection. The record closed \non March 10. 2022. \nFindings of Fact \nIn his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted, with comments, all of the factual \nallegations in the SOR (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a. and 1.b., 2.a., and 3.a.). His admissions and \ncomments are incorporated herein. After a complete and thorough review of the evidence \nin the record, and upon due consideration of same, I make the following findings of fact: \nApplicant is a 34-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has been serving \nas a software development lead with his current employer since October 2021. He \npreviously served as a software developer (April 2019 \u2013 October 2021); software \ndevelopment lead (October 2018 \u2013 April 2019) and application developer (February 2011 \n\u2013 July 2018). He did not indicate when he graduated from high school, but he did receive \na bachelor\u2019s degree in 2010, and earned additional college credits towards a master\u2019s \ndegree, but has not completed the requirements for such a degree. He has never served \nwith the U.S. military. He has never held a security clearance. He was married in 2020. \nHe has one child, born in 2021.  \nSexual Behavior, Personal Conduct, and Criminal Conduct \nIn his SF 86, in response to inquiries regarding his police record, Applicant \nreported an incident that occurred in July 2018: \nI regrettably exposed my genitalia to someone that could visible see me \nthrough a window. The following morning there was a news story about the \nincident. I immediately called the police department and let them know I was \nthe person of interest in the news story. I gave them all my information and \nmet with a detective. I didn\u2019t hear anything from them until the end of the \nyear (November 2018). I received a notice for an appearance for the \n2 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nincident. We are still in the process of negotiating a plea with the district \nattorney. I believe we are close to negotiating a withhold of adjudication as \nthe witnesses are not interested in pursuing anything against me. As a result \nof my actions, I lost my position [with my employer]. I lost many friends. I \nlost the trust of my family. It was a disgraceful act that does not show my \ntrue character. By my own choice I have been seeing a therapist biweekly \nsince the incident happened (July of 2018). I\u2019ve seen my father cry two \ntimes, once when my grandmother passed and once the day of this news \nstory. I am confident this issue will not happen ever again. I am very aware \nthat this has the possibility to disqualify me from receiving clearance but I \nstill want to be 100% transparent with everyone. There is no possibility of \nblackmail related to this because a lot of people I know already have heard \nthis story. I have accepted my past and am trying to better myself with a \nbright future. \n(GE 1 at 40) \nOn May 15, 2019, Applicant was interviewed by an investigator with the U.S. Office \nof Personnel Management (OPM). During that interview, he expanded on the incident: \nIn [July 2018] [he] went by himself . . . to the [university]. [He] walked around \non campus and then purposefully exposed his genitals to persons inside of \na food/cafeteria establishment through a window ([he] was standing outside \nflashing the people on the inside). [He] does not remember who he was \nflashing other than it appeared to be women inside of the building. [He] \nexposed himself as he enjoyed doing the act. [He] ran away from the area \nafter he was noticed by people inside the establishment and left the \ncampus. . . . \n(GE 2 at 7 \nAs a result of Applicant\u2019s self-report to the police, in November 2018, a summons \nwas issued charging him with exposure of sexual organ. Throughout the remaining \nportion of 2018 and up through mid-2019, the matter continued until June 5, 2019. On \nthat date, upon his plea of No Contest, the court suspended imposition of sentence and \nplaced him on probation for the term of six months; ordered him to stay away from the \nlocation of the offense; ordered him to have no contact with the victim; and directed him \nto continue counseling. (GE 3; AE D) He successfully completed his probation and it was \nterminated on December 4, 2019. (AE G) \nIn addition to the July 2018 incident, Applicant also reported to the OPM \ninvestigator that three prior similar incidents took place 2015, 2016, and 2017. He was \nnot caught by law enforcement after any of those other incidents. (GE 2 at 8) Upon \nreconsideration, during the hearing, he stated that there were four or five such incidents. \n(Tr. at 26) Although he never targeted certain individuals, he flashed primarily young \nwomen. He never followed them; he never attempted to touch them; he never had \nphysical contact with them; and he never attempted to commit any sex acts with them. \n3 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(Tr. at 26-27) His motive for his actions was merely his own sexual gratification. (Tr. at \n27) The initial incident occurred during a period when Applicant was encountering a \n\u201ccommunication barrier\u201d with his girlfriend before they actually married. She was unaware \nof any of the incidents until he told her following the 2018 incident. (Tr. at 34) \nDuring the period of his earlier incidents, he considered seeking professional help, \nbut because of the stigma associated with seeking such help, he did not take any such \nactions. (Tr. at 25) Applicant started addressing his issues regarding his conduct following \nthe July 2018 incident. He voluntarily engaged the professional services of a licensed \npsychologist that same month, and they initially met for a total of 25 sessions between \n2018 and 2019, with their most recent session taking place in February 2022. They initially \nmet weekly, then once each month, and then every other month. (Tr. at 30) At one point, \nbecause of the pandemic, no in-person sessions were held, but they finally did so in \nFebruary 2022, when he was prescribed antidepressants. (Tr. at 31-33) \nAnother aspect of Applicant\u2019s condition was revealed during therapy. When \nApplicant was in the 7th  grade, he was molested by an 11th  grade high school student who \nwas with a group of friends. The older boy essentially directed him to \u201cshow his privates\u201d, \nand although he did not want to do it, he did so. He never told anyone about the incident, \nbut the incident stayed with him for a substantial time. He finally told someone \u2013 his \npsychologist \u2013 about it. (Tr. at 35; Answer to the SOR at 1)  \nBased on the information reviewed during therapy, the psychologist\u2019s opinion was: \n[Applicant] was previously diagnosed and treated for Major Depressive \nDisorder and Exhibitionist Disorder. Over the course of treatment, we \ninvestigated the source(s) for the symptoms in question and worked to \neliminate the problematic behaviors, especially the exhibitionistic behaviors. \nIt is my opinion that the Exhibitionistic Disorder is in full remission at this \ntime, as he \u201chas not acted on the urges with a nonconsenting person, and \nthere has been no distress or impairment in social, occupational or other \nareas of functioning\u201d (DSM-5) since 2018. However, he did report \noccasional mild depressive and anxiety issues, and, accordingly, we have \nagreed to recurring psychotherapy services for the foreseeable future to \nassist with ongoing mental health issues. \n(AE E) \nAs noted above, the psychologist indicated that the Exhibitionist Disorder was \nconsidered to be in full remission. Exhibitionistic Disorder (exposing the genitals) is \nconsidered one of the Paraphilic Disorders under the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual \nof Disorders, 5th  Edition \u2013 Text Revision (DSM-V) at 685) Exhibitionist Disorder was \nselected for specific listing and assignment of explicit diagnostic criteria in the DSM for \ntwo main reasons: it is relatively common, in relation to other paraphilic disorders, and it \nmay entail actions for the individual\u2019s satisfaction that are noxious or potentially harmful \nto others, and classified as criminal offenses. Because of the nature of Applicant\u2019s alleged \nactivities, they are considered anomalous activity preferences which resemble distorted \n4 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ncomponents of human courtship. They are not considered anomalous target preferences. \nThe term paraphilia denotes any intense and persistent sexual interest other than sexual \ninterest in genital stimulation or preparatory fondling with phenotypically normal, \nphysically mature, consenting human partners. However, in some circumstances, the \ncriteria \u201cintense and persistent\u201d may be difficult to apply. In such instances, the term \nparaphilia may be defined as any sexual interest greater than or equal to normophilic \nsexual interests. (DSM-V at 685-686, 689-691) \nWhile Applicant has not exposed himself since the July 2018 incident \u2013 over three \nand one-half years ago \u2013 he did acknowledge that he has had thoughts about doing so, \nbut he has successfully blocked those thoughts and urges. (Tr. at 35-36, 46, 50) His \nparticipation with a psychologist to treat his depression was encouraged by his family \nphysician. (AE F) \nWork Performance and Character References \nApplicant\u2019s current Site Lead considers Applicant to be a master-level software \ndeveloper and data architect as well as a team lead and mentor for the software \ndevelopers. He exceeds expectations in all capacities. He sets high standards for himself \nand his software team and works tirelessly to deliver useful products. The way he coaches \nand develops junior developers sets him apart from many software subject matter \nexperts. Colleagues check in with him daily to ask questions, verify an approach, or seek \nhelp troubleshooting. Ever patient and helpful, he never fails to support teammates. \nColleagues respond enthusiastically to his style of leadership. He has always been \npersonable and professional. His impressive expertise and leadership have delivered \ncritical solutions to date, and with a clearance, he would be able to add additional value \nthrough increased analysis and interaction. (AE C) \nThe Chief, Knowledge Management Division, relies heavily on Applicant\u2019s skills \nand judgment to ensure they do right for their leaders and staff. With a clearance, he \nenvisions Applicant taking on greater leadership roles as his software subject matter \nexpert. (AE B) \nA work colleague and teammate reports that Applicant is highly respected by all \nwho know him \u2013 both teammates and customers alike. Everyone seeks out his guidance \nand trusts his judgment for professional and personal matters equally. (AE A) \nPolicies \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the Executive \nBranch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security emphasizing, \n\u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d (Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. \n518, 528 (1988)). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to control \naccess to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual \nis sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information. The standard that must be \nmet is that, based on all available information, the person\u2019s loyalty, reliability, and \n5 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \ntrustworthiness are such that granting the person access to classified information is \nclearly consistent with the interests of national security. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines in SEAD 4. In addition to \nbrief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating \nan applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nAn administrative judge need not view the guidelines as inflexible, ironclad rules \nof law. Instead, acknowledging the complexities of human behavior, the administrative \njudge applies these guidelines in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative \nprocess. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. The entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of \nvariables known as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a meaningful decision. The concept recognizes that we should \nview a person by the totality of his or her acts, omissions, motivations and other variables. \nEach case must be adjudged on its own merits, taking into consideration all relevant \ncircumstances, and applying sound judgment, mature thinking, and careful analysis. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours as well. It is \nbecause of this special relationship that the Government must be able to repose a high \ndegree of trust and confidence in those individuals to whom it grants access to classified \ninformation. \nDecisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the applicant \nmay deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified information. Such \ndecisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather \nthan actual, risk of compromise of sensitive information.  Furthermore, security clearance \ndeterminations should err, if they must, on the side of denials. (Department of the Navy \nv. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988)). In reaching this decision, I have drawn only those \nconclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on the evidence contained in the \nrecord. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere speculation or \nconjecture. \nAnalysis \nAt the outset, I note I had ample opportunity to evaluate the demeanor of Applicant, \nobserve his manner and deportment, appraise the way in which he responded to \nquestions, assess his candor or evasiveness, read his statements, and listen to his \ntestimony. It is my impression that his explanations regarding his psychological conditions \nissues are consistent and have the solid resonance of truth. \n6 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \nUpon consideration of all the facts in evidence, including those in the DOD CAF \ncase file, those submitted by Applicant, and his testimony, as well as an assessment of \nApplicant\u2019s demeanor and credibility, and after application of all appropriate legal \nprecepts and factors, I conclude the following with respect to the allegations set forth in \nthe SOR: \nGuideline D, Sexual Behavior \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Sexual Behavior is set out in AG \n\u00b612. \nSexual behavior that involves a criminal offense; reflects a lack of judgment \nor discretion; or may subject the individual to undue influence of coercion, \nexploitation, or duress. These issues, together or individually, may raise \nquestions about an individual's judgment, reliability, trustworthiness, and \nability to protect classified or sensitive information. Sexual behavior \nincludes conduct occurring in person or via audio, visual, electronic, or \nwritten transmission. No adverse inference concerning the standards in this \nGuideline may be raised solely on the basis of the sexual orientation of the \nindividual. \nThe guideline notes several conditions under AG \u00b6 13 that could raise security \nconcerns in this case: \n(a) sexual behavior of a criminal nature, whether or not the individual has \nbeen prosecuted; \n(b) a pattern of compulsive, self-destructive, or high-risk sexual behavior \nthat the individual is unable to stop;  \n(c) sexual behavior that causes an individual to be vulnerable to coercion, \nexploitation, or duress; and \n(d) sexual behavior of a public nature or that reflects lack of discretion or \njudgment. \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 13(a), 13(b), 13(c), and 13(d) have been established. Applicant\u2019s \nExhibitionistic Disorder (exposing his genitals) in public on several occasions between \n2015 and 2018 constituted a pattern of compulsive and high-risk behavior of a criminal \nnature that reflected a lack of discretion and opened him up to criminal prosecution. Only \none of those incidents \u2013 the one that occurred in July 2018 \u2013 led to his prosecution, \nessentially because it was reported publically and he turned himself into the authorities. \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions under AG \u00b6 14 that could \nmitigate security concerns arising from his Sexual Behavior: \n7 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(b) the sexual behavior happened so long ago, so infrequently, or under \nsuch unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or judgment; \n(c) the behavior no longer serves as a basis for coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and \n(e) the individual has successfully completed an appropriate program of \ntreatment, or is currently enrolled in one, has demonstrated ongoing and \nconsistent compliance with the treatment plan, and/or has received a \nfavorable prognosis from a qualified mental health professional indicating \nthe behavior is readily controllable with treatment. \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 14(b), 14(c), and 14(e) have been established. The significance of his child-\nhood incident, the memory of which stayed with him for so long, was not fully explained. \nApplicant\u2019s sexual behavior took place between 2015 and 2018, generally once each \nyear, but there have been no repeated incidents since the one in July 2018. Although he \nflashed primarily young women, he never followed them; he never attempted to touch \nthem; he never had physical contact with them; and he never attempted to commit any \nsex acts with them. His motive for his actions was merely his own sexual gratification. \nThings changed after that most recent incident. He self-reported to the police, his \nemployer, and his family. He sought professional help. Because of his self-reporting, the \nbehavior no longer serves as a basis for coercion, exploitation, or duress. Because he \nsought professional help, he underwent treatment for the Exhibitionistic Disorder. The \npsychologist \u2013 a qualified mental health professional \u2013 indicated that the Exhibitionist \nDisorder was considered to be in full remission. While Applicant recently restarted seeing \nhis psychologist, the focus of the continuing treatment is his Major Depressive Disorder, \nan issue that is apparently of little security concern to the Government because it was not \nalleged in the SOR. Moreover, that disorder seems to be controlled by prescribed \nmedication. \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Personal Conduct is set out in \nAG \u00b6 15: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. The following will normally result in \nan unfavorable national security eligibility determination, security clearance \naction, or cancellation of further processing for national security eligibility: \n(a) refusal, or failure without reasonable cause, to undergo or \ncooperate with security processing, including but not limited \n8 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \nto meeting with a security investigator for subject interview, \ncompleting security forms or releases, cooperation with \nmedical \nor \npsychological \nevaluation, \nor \npolygraph \nexamination, if authorized and required; and \n(b) refusal to provide full, frank, and truthful answers to lawful \nquestions of investigators, security officials, or other official \nrepresentatives in connection with a personnel security or \ntrustworthiness determination. \nThe guideline also includes an example of a condition that could raise security \nconcerns under AG \u00b6 16: \n(c) credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is \nnot sufficient for an adverse determination under any other single guideline, \nbut which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-person \nassessment of questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack \nof candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations, or other \ncharacteristics indicating that the individual may not properly safeguard \nclassified or sensitive information. \nAG \u00b6 16(c) has been established. My discussion related to Applicant\u2019s sexual \nbehavior is adopted herein. Following the July 2018 incident, Applicant informed his \nemployer of what had transpired. He was fired. \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions under AG \u00b6 17 that could \nmitigate security concerns arising from personal conduct. They include: \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, \nunreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to \nrecur; and \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate vulnerability \nto exploitation, manipulation, or duress. \nAG \u00b6 17(c), 17(d), and 17(e) apply. By its very nature, the SOR allegation has \nlimited Applicant\u2019s alleged personal conduct to the fact that he was fired by his employer \nbecause of the July 2018 incident. No other issues of personal conduct are alleged. That \nincident and the actual termination both occurred in July 2018 \u2013 over three and one-half \nyears ago. Applicant not only acknowledged the behavior, he self-reported it, to the police, \n9 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nhis family, and to his employer.

After a significant number \nof treatment sessions, that psychologist\u2019s professional opinion was that the Exhibitionistic \nDisorder \u2013 the actual basis for the sexual behavior and the firing \u2013 is in full remission. \nThus, the stressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to Applicant\u2019s \nuntrustworthy, unreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, have been alleviated. \nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Criminal Conduct is set out in AG \n\u00b6 30: \nCriminal activity creates doubt about a person's judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person's ability or \nwillingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations. \nThe guideline notes one condition under AG \u00b6 31 that could raise security \nconcerns: \n(b) evidence (including, but not limited to, a credible allegation, an \nadmission, and matters of official record) of criminal conduct, regardless of \nwhether the individual was formally charged, prosecuted, or convicted. \nAG \u00b6 31(b) has been established. My discussions related to Sexual Behavior and \nPersonal Conduct are adopted herein. In July 2018, Applicant went to the university \nwhere he walked around on campus and purposefully exposed his genitals to persons \ninside of a food/cafeteria establishment through a window. He was standing outside \nflashing the people on the inside. He ran away from the area after he was noticed by \npeople inside the establishment and left the campus. He self-reported the incident to the \npolice. In November 2018, a summons was issued charging him with exposure of sexual \norgan. Upon his plea of No Contest, in November 2018, the court suspended imposition \nof sentence and placed him on probation for the term of six months; ordered him to stay \naway from the location of the offense; ordered him to have no contact with the victim; and \ndirected him to continue counseling. He successfully completed his probation and it was \nterminated on December 4, 2019. That was the sole allegation against him under \nGuideline J. \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions under AG \u00b6 32 that could \nmitigate security concerns arising from Criminal Conduct: \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur and \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; and \n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including, but not limited \nto, the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, restitution, \ncompliance with the terms of parole or probation, job training or higher \n10 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \neducation, \ngood \nemployment \nrecord, \nor \nconstructive \ncommunity \ninvolvement. \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 32(a) and 32(d) apply. Appellant\u2019s sole alleged criminal conduct incident, \nwhen he exposed his genitals on the university campus, occurred in July 2018, over three \nand one-half years ago. There is substantial evidence of successful rehabilitation; \nincluding, but not limited to, the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, \ncompliance with the terms of his court order and probation, and an otherwise outstanding \nemployment record. Applicant not only acknowledged the behavior, he self-reported it, to \nthe police, his family, and to his employer. He took immediate steps to address his \nbehavior and engaged the professional services of a licensed psychologist. After a \nsignificant number of treatment sessions, that psychologist\u2019s professional opinion was \nthat the Exhibitionistic Disorder \u2013 the actual basis for the sexual behavior and criminal \nconduct \u2013 is in full remission. Thus, the stressors, circumstances, or factors that \ncontributed to Applicant\u2019s untrustworthy, unreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, have \nbeen alleviated, and his criminal conduct no longer casts doubt on his current reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and good judgment. \nThe existence of a psychological condition does not preclude the granting of a \nsecurity clearance. Some conditions are unrelated to security issues and others can be \nmitigated by ongoing treatment or other factors. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the appellant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. Moreover, I have \nevaluated the various aspects of this case in light of the totality of the record evidence \nand have not merely performed a piecemeal analysis. (See U.S. v. Bottone, 365 F.2d \n389, 392 (2d Cir. 1966)) \nThere is some evidence against mitigating Applicant\u2019s conduct. In July 2018, \nApplicant went to the university where he walked around on campus and purposefully \n11 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \nexposed his genitals to persons inside of a food/cafeteria establishment through a \nwindow. He was standing outside flashing the people on the inside. He ran away from the \narea after he was noticed by people inside the establishment and left the campus. He \nself-reported the incident to the police. He was fired by his employer. In November 2018, \na summons was issued charging him with exposure of sexual organ. Upon his plea of No \nContest, in November 2018, the court suspended imposition of sentence and placed him \non probation for the term of six months. \nThe mitigating evidence under the whole-person concept is simply more \nsubstantial. Applicant is a 34-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has been \nserving as a software development lead with his current employer since October 2021. \nHe previously served as a software developer; software development lead; and \napplication developer. He received a bachelor\u2019s degree in 2010, and earned additional \ncollege credits towards a master\u2019s degree, but has not completed the requirements for \nsuch a degree. Applicant not only acknowledged the July 2018 behavior, he self-reported \nit to the police, his family, and to his employer. He took immediate steps to address his \nbehavior and engaged the professional services of a licensed psychologist. After a \nsignificant number of treatment sessions, that psychologist\u2019s professional opinion was \nthat the Exhibitionistic Disorder \u2013 the actual basis for the sexual behavior, criminal \nconduct, and the firing \u2013 is in full remission. His supervisors and colleagues think very \nhighly of him. He successfully completed his probation and it was terminated on \nDecember 4, 2019. \nOverall, the evidence leaves me without questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s \neligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all of these reasons, I conclude \nApplicant has mitigated the security concerns arising from his sexual behavior, personal \nconduct, and criminal conduct. Although he was afflicted with Exhibitionist Disorder, he \nsought treatment from a licensed psychologist and after numerous therapy sessions, his \ndisorder was diagnosed as being in remission. See SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6\u00b6 2(d)(1) through \n2(d)(9). \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline D: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a. and 1.b.: \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline E: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 2.a.: \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 3, Guideline J: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 3.a.: \nFor Applicant \n12 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security clearance. \nEligibility for access to classified information is granted. \nROBERT ROBINSON GALES \nAdministrative Judge \n13 \n",

The guideline cited in the SOR was one of the \nadjudicative guidelines (AG) issued by the Director of National Intelligence on December \n10, 2016, to be effective for all security clearance adjudications on or after June 8, 2017. \nApplicant timely responded to the SOR (Answer) and requested a hearing before \nan administrative judge from the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA). The \ncase was assigned to me on October 25, 2021, and I scheduled a hearing for February \n25, 2022. The parties appeared as scheduled. \nDepartment Counsel proffered Government Exhibits (GX) 1 and 2. Department \nCounsel also provided a copy of a Discovery Letter to Applicant, dated November 24, \n2020, and a Government\u2019s Exhibit List. They are included in the record as Hearing \nExhibits (HX) 1 and 2, respectively. Applicant and one other witness testified. Applicant \nalso proffered Applicant Exhibits (AX) A and B. All exhibits were admitted without \nobjection. The record closed at the end of the hearing, and I received a transcript of the \nhearing (Tr.) on March 4, 2022. \nFindings of Fact \nUnder Guideline H, the Government alleged that Applicant used marijuana with \nvarying frequency between June 2012 and February 2018, at times while holding a \nsecurity clearance (SOR 1.a); and that he used cocaine in about March 2016 while \nholding a security clearance (SOR 1.b). In response, Applicant admitted, with \nexplanations, both of the SOR allegations (Answer). In addition to the facts established \nby Applicant\u2019s admissions, I make the following findings of fact. \nApplicant is 38 years old and has worked for a defense contractor since November \n2018 in a position that requires eligibility for a security clearance. He served on active \nduty in the U.S. military between June 2006 and June 2016, when he received an \nhonorable discharge.

(Answer; \nGX 1; GX 2; Tr. 26 \u2013 30) \nApplicant\u2019s first use of marijuana occurred while he was on extended military leave \nduring a permanent change of stations (PCS) in June 2012.

When some of \nthe attendees started smoking marijuana, Applicant used the drug when it was offered. \nAgain, he had consumed a lot of alcohol during the party. (Answer; GX 2; Tr. 43 \u2013 44) \nIn 2017, after Applicant\u2019s discharge, he worked with a longtime friend repairing, \nrenovating, and flipping houses. One day he went to his friend\u2019s brother\u2019s house to check \non a repair. He was hungry when he got there, and helped himself to some brownies that \nwere left out in the kitchen. He did not know the brownies contained THC until he felt odd \nnot long after eating one of them. (Answer; GX 2; Tr. 28 \u2013 29, 44 \u2013 45, 56 \u2013 58) \nIn February 2018, Applicant received in the mail a bag of between 10 and 20 \ngummy candies with THC in them (gummies). They were sent, with Applicant\u2019s \nknowledge and approval, by a friend he served with in the military. That person lived in a \nstate where marijuana is legal under certain conditions. Applicant did not consider that \nthis conduct -- possessing or using THC -- might be illegal where he lived. Applicant ate \none or two of the gummies before giving the rest away. (Answer; GX 1; GX 2; Tr. 30 \u2013 31, \n45 \u2013 48, 61) \nAfter Applicant left the military, he worked in a variety of jobs, none of which \nrequired a security clearance. When he received the THC gummies in 2018, he was \nworking at a civilian power plant. Later in 2018, he was hired by a temporary personnel \ncompany for work at the same government facility and on the same project for which his \ncurrent employer hired him in November 2018. (GX 1; GX 2; Tr. 23 \u2013 26, 45 \u2013 47 \nBefore 2018, Applicant\u2019s lifestyle included attending parties and frequenting bars \nand nightclubs, at times drinking to the point of intoxication. However, since October \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n2018, he has been in a committed relationship and leads a stable, healthy lifestyle. \nApplicant has not been intoxicated since 2017 and he no longer associates with old \nfriends or anyone else who uses illegal drugs. Applicant asserted that he has no intention \nof using any illegal substance and he understands the adverse consequences that would \nensue relative to his eligibility for access to classified information. Further, Applicant has \na solid reputation for good judgment and reliability at work and among his personal \nassociates. A family member with extensive experience in government work that requires \naccess to classified information, and who has known Applicant for most of his life, testified \nthat Applicant is trustworthy, reliable, and of good character, and that Applicant has \nmatured significantly over the past few years. (Answer; GX 1; GX 2; AX A; AX B; Tr. 17 \n\u2013 19, 31 \u2013 34, 59 \u2013 61, 65 \u2013 75) \nPolicies \nEach security clearance decision must be a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndetermination based on examination of all available relevant and material information, \nand consideration of the pertinent criteria and adjudication policy in the adjudicative \nguidelines (AG). (See Directive, 6.3) Decisions must also reflect consideration of the \nfactors listed in \u00b6 2(d) of the guidelines. Commonly referred to as the \u201cwhole-person\u201d \nconcept, those factors are: \n(1) The nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation\nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct;\n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the\nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe presence or absence of a disqualifying or mitigating condition is not \ndeterminative of a conclusion for or against an applicant. However, specific applicable \nguidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against them as they \nrepresent policy guidance governing the grant or denial of access to classified \ninformation. A security clearance decision is intended only to resolve whether it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest for an applicant to either receive or continue to have \naccess to classified information. (See Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518) \nThe Government bears the initial burden of producing admissible information on \nwhich it based the preliminary decision to deny or revoke a security clearance for an \napplicant. Additionally, the Government must be able to prove controverted facts alleged\nin the SOR. If the Government meets its burden, it then falls to the applicant to refute, \nextenuate or mitigate the Government\u2019s case. Because no one has a \u201cright\u201d to a security \nclearance, an applicant bears a heavy burden of persuasion. (See Egan, 484 U.S. at 528,\n531) A person who has access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship\n \n \n \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nwith the Government based on trust and confidence. Thus, the Government has a \ncompelling interest in ensuring each applicant possesses the requisite judgment, \nreliability and trustworthiness of one who will protect the national interests as his or her \nown. The \u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d standard compels resolution of any \nreasonable doubt about an applicant\u2019s suitability for access in favor of the Government. \n(See Egan; AG \u00b6 2(b)) \nAnalysis \nDrug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nApplicant used or ingested marijuana four times between 2012 and 2018. He also \nused cocaine once in 2016. His use of marijuana in 2012 and his use of cocaine occurred \nwhile he was on active duty in the U.S. military and while holding an active security \nclearance in connection with his military duties. He also used marijuana a few months \nafter leaving the military in 2016 while his security clearance was still active, but while he \nwas not employed in a position requiring a security clearance. In 2018, Applicant agreed \nto receive through the mail THC-laced gummies from a friend. Applicant ate two of them \nbefore giving the rest away. And in 2017, Applicant unintentionally ingested a brownie \ncontaining THC. Aside from the 2017 incident, available information reasonably raises a \nsecurity concern about Applicant\u2019s use or involvement with illegal drugs. That security \nconcern is expressed at AG \u00b6 24: \n \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual's reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior may \nlead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. Controlled substance means any \"controlled substance\" as \ndefined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term adopted in \nthis guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above. \nMore specifically, available information requires the application of the \nfollowing AG \u00b6 25 disqualifying conditions: \n(a) any substance misuse (see above definition); \n(c) illegal possession of a controlled substance, including cultivation, \nprocessing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of \ndrug paraphernalia; and \n(f) any illegal drug use while granted access to classified information or \nholding a sensitive position. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nBy contrast, Applicant\u2019s use of illegal drugs, while not isolated, was sporadic at \nmost. Applicant has not used any illegal drugs since February 2018. He no longer \nassociates with anyone who uses illegal drugs. More importantly, he has a lifestyle \nconducive to sobriety that militates against the possibility that his use of illegal drugs will \nrecur. Available information supports the application of the following AG \u00b6 26 mitigating \nconditions: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and substance \nmisuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and \nhas established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not limited to: (1) \ndisassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; (2) changing or \navoiding the environment where drugs were used; . . . . \nFor the past four years, Applicant has been healthy and physically active; he has \nstopped going to parties and bars, circumstances where he was likely to experience \nimpaired judgment through drinking, which was a common factor in at least three of the \noccasions when he used illegal drugs. He now consumes alcohol only in moderation, and \nhe lives a more stable lifestyle supportive of better judgment and reliability. All of the \nforegoing makes it highly unlikely he will use illegal drugs again. \nI also have evaluated this record in the context of the whole-person factors listed \nin AG \u00b6 2(d). Applicant\u2019s use of illegal drugs while on active duty and with a security \nclearance is not a minor concern. Such significant disregard for rules and regulations may \nindicate that he would not properly safeguard classified information were he to again be \ngiven a security clearance. However, the passage of time since his last use of illegal \ndrugs, along with maturation and a significant change in is personal circumstances, are \nsufficient to overcome the security concerns about his previous misconduct. Additionally, \nApplicant has been forthcoming about his drug involvement and I found him credible in \nhis assertions that he does not intend to use illegal drugs again. He also presented \nreliable, recent information that shows him to be of good character and trustworthiness. \nOn balance, Applicant has mitigated the Guideline H security concerns, and the record \nevidence as a whole supports a fair and commonsense conclusion in favor of granting his \nrequest for access to classified information. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required by section \nE3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline H: \nFOR APPLICANT \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                        \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a and 1.b: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the foregoing, it is clearly consistent with the interests of national \nsecurity for Applicant to have access to classified information.

He touched her through her clothing when she was sleeping \n(or pretending to sleep). He did this once a week for a month. The child told her mother \n(Applicant\u2019s second wife) about Applicant\u2019s actions. He admitted his behavior. He also \nadmitted viewing images of adolescent girls ages 11 to 15 in sexually erotic poses \nduring this time. He was arrested on felony charges of sexual assault on a child and \nsexual assault on a child while in a position of trust. He pleaded guilty and was given a \ndeferred sentence, which included four years of unsupervised probation. He was also \nordered to attend treatment by a therapist for four years. He was ordered to register as \na sex offender. He successfully completed his probation, including attending his court-\nordered treatment. He was released from probation and successfully fulfilled the terms \nof his deferred sentence in 2001. The original charges were then dropped. From 2001 \nto 2016, he voluntarily attended a 12-step recovery program for sex addicts. He \nbelieved the meetings were helpful, but his wife did not, so he stopped attending. He is \nno longer listed as a sex offender in his home state. In his SOR answer, Applicant \nclaimed that a therapist gave him a favorable prognosis against reoffending. He did not \noffer any records to document of said prognosis or discuss his treatment history. (Tr. 27, \n37-38, 40; GE 2, 7; AE C; SOR answer) \nFrom June 2001 to March 2015, Applicant worked for employer 1 (E1) as a \nsoftware engineer. In his interview with a defense investigator in July 2019, Applicant \nadmitted that he signed documents provided by E1, or E1\u2019s predecessor company, \nacknowledging that he was prohibited from having and viewing pornography on his \ncompany-provided computer. In his hearing testimony, Applicant equivocated this point \nstating that he could not recall any specific formal company policy regarding the \npersonal use of a company-issued laptop. He also stated that someone told him he \ncould use his company-issued laptop for personal use, but he could not recall who that \nperson was. I did not find Applicant\u2019s testimony credible.

In \nhis SOR answer, he admitted using his company-issued laptop to view, upload, and \nsave images of naked women and scantily dressed young girls (ages 11-15) posed in \nerotic positions. He also admitted signing company documents prohibiting him from \nusing his company-laptop for these purposes. (Tr. 23-24, 28-29, 34-35; GE 2, 4, 5; SOR \nanswer) \nApplicant denied using his current company-issued computer to view, download, \nor save any type of pornographic material. He documented that he has no criminal \nrecord in his home state, other than the 1997 child sexual abuse crime. He admitted \nthat he continues to view child erotica on his personal electronic devices. He viewed \nthese types of images as recently as a month before his security clearance hearing. He \ncontinues to view this material because he is sexually stimulated by viewing images of \nscantily dressed girls, ages 11 to 15, in modeling poses. He admitted that his actions \nshow questionable judgment on his part. (Tr. 24-26, 28-29, 34-36; GE 2; AE B \nApplicant presented several \u201cU Rock\u201d awards from his current employer \nrecognizing his contributions to the overall success of the company. He also received \nrecognition for his five years of service in August 2020. (AE A) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(a), the entire process is a careful weighing of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk that an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline D, Sexual Behavior \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for sexual behavior is set out in AG \n\u00b6 12: \nSexual behavior that involves a criminal offense; reflects a lack of \njudgment or discretion; or may subject the individual to undue influence of \ncoercion, exploitation, or duress. These issues, together or individually, \nmay \nraise \nquestions \nabout \nan \nindividual's \njudgment, \nreliability, \ntrustworthiness, and ability to protect classified or sensitive information. \nSexual behavior includes conduct occurring in person or via audio, visual, \nelectronic, or written transmission. No adverse inference concerning the \nstandards in this Guideline may be raised solely on the basis of the sexual \norientation of the individual. \nAG \u00b6 13 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying in this case. The following is potentially applicable: \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(a) sexual behavior of a criminal nature, whether or not the individual has \nbeen prosecuted; and   \n(d) sexual behavior of a public nature or that reflects lack of discretion or \njudgment. \nIn approximately 1997, Applicant admitted and pleaded guilty to sexually \nassaulting his 11-year-old stepdaughter on multiple occasions. Between 2001 and \n2015, Applicant admitted downloading and viewing on his company-issued laptop \nimages of adult pornography and child erotica. He further admitted that his actions \ndemonstrated poor judgment. The above disqualifying conditions apply to SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a \nand 1.b. The allegation in SOR \u00b6 1.c does not fall within any disqualifying condition \nunder this Guideline. \nI have also considered all of the mitigating conditions for sexual behavior under \nAG \u00b6 14 and considered the following potentially relevant: \n(b) the sexual behavior happened so long ago, so infrequently, or under \nsuch unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or judgment; \nand \n(e) the individual has successfully completed an appropriate program of \ntreatment, or is currently enrolled in one, has demonstrated ongoing and \nconsistent compliance with the treatment plan, and/or has received a \nfavorable prognosis from a qualified mental health professional indicating \nthe behavior is readily controllable with treatment. \nApplicant\u2019s sexual assaults on his 11-year-old stepdaughter occurred over twenty \nyears ago. His viewing of adult pornography and child erotica on his company-issued \nlaptop occurred as recently as 2015. While these dates might suggest that his actions \nare in the past, his admission of his ongoing fascination of and stimulation by viewing \nchild erotica, as recently as a month before his hearing, calls into question his recent \njudgment. The common denominator of a continuing sexual fascination with pre-\nteenage girls and his past criminal acts and unauthorized computer use also involving \npre-teenage girls casts doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, and judgment. \nAG \u00b6 14(b) does not apply. Applicant completed the court-ordered counseling \nassociated with his 1997 offense. He failed to corroborated his assertions that a \ntherapist gave him a positive prognosis concerning his sexual behavior. He also failed \nto document any treatment he received. AG \u00b6 14(e) has some application. \nGuideline M, Use of Information Technology Systems \nAG \u00b6 39 expresses the security concern pertaining to use of information \ntechnology systems: \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFailure to comply with rules, procedures, guidelines, or regulations \npertaining to information technology systems may raise security concerns \nabout an individual's reliability and trustworthiness, calling into question \nthe willingness or ability to properly protect sensitive systems, networks, \nand information. Information Technology includes any computer-based, \nmobile, or wireless device used to create, store, access, process, \nmanipulate, protect, or move information. This includes any component, \nwhether integrated into a larger system or not, such as hardware, \nsoftware, or firmware, used to enable or facilitate these operations. \nAG \u00b6 40 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. I have considered the following as potentially relevant: \n(e) unauthorized use of any information technology system; and \n(f) introduction, removal, or duplication of hardware, firmware, software, or \nmedia to or from any information technology system when prohibited by \nrules, procedures, guidelines, or regulations or when otherwise not \nauthorized. \nApplicant\u2019s signing documents putting him on notice that the use of his company-\nissued computer was not for personal use does not raise a disqualifying condition under \nthis Guideline. From 2001 and 2015, Applicant viewed, downloaded, and saved adult \npornographic images and child erotica using his company-issued laptop in violation of \nC1\u2019s written prohibition to use the laptop for these purposes. The above conditions are \napplicable to SOR \u00b6 2.b, but not to SOR \u00b6 2.a. \nI reviewed all of the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 41, and I considered the \nfollowing relevant: \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur \nand does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or \ngood judgment.   \nAlthough some time has passed since Applicant engaged in his unauthorized \naction, he failed to fully accept responsibility for his actions by claiming that \u201csomeone\u201d \ntold him he could use his company laptop for personal use. Future recurrence cannot be \nruled out. Without accepting responsibility for his actions his current reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and judgment are called into question. AG \u00b6 41(a) does not fully apply. \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the personal conduct security concern: \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. \nAG \u00b6 31 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying in this case. The following are potentially applicable: \n(e) personal conduct, or concealment of information about one's conduct, \nthat creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress by a \nforeign intelligence entity or other individual or group. Such conduct \nincludes: \n(1) engaging in activities which, if known, could affect the person's\npersonal, professional, or community standing; and \n \n(f) violation of a written or recorded commitment made by the individual to \nthe employer as a condition of employment. \nApplicant\u2019s occasions of committing sexual abuse on his 11-year-old \nstepdaughter demonstrate questionable behavior and raise questions about his \nreliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information. Likewise, his use \nof his company-issued laptop to view pornography and child erotica would affect his \npersonal and professional standing. Applicant used his company-issued laptop in \nviolation of the written company policy not to do so. I find the above disqualifying \nconditions applicable, although SOR \u00b6\u00b6 3.a and 3.b essentially allege the same \nunderlying conduct. Because of this, I find for Applicant on SOR \u00b6 3.a. \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns \narising from personal conduct. I have considered all of the mitigating conditions under \nAG \u00b6 17 and found the following relevant: \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, \nunreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely \nto recur; \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n       \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate \nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress. \nAs stated under the Guideline D analysis above, because of the similarities \nbetween Applicant\u2019s continuing sexual affixation on pre-teenage girls and his past \ncriminal and employment-ending behavior also involving pre-teenage girls, the passage \nof time here is not determinant. His actions continue to cast doubt on his reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and good judgment. To some extent he has accepted responsibility for \nhis criminal acts perpetrated on his stepdaughter. He also admitted he used poor \njudgment using his company-issued laptop (while also claiming he was told by \nsomeone\u2014unverified\u2014he could use it for personal use) to download and view \npornography and child erotica. He completed court-ordered counseling and he claims \nhe sought counseling through a 12-step program and use of a therapist, but failed to \ndocument these activities. AG \u00b6 17(c) does not apply, but AG \u00b6\u00b6 17(d) and 17(e) have \nsome application. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I considered Applicant\u2019s awards, his \nremoval from the sex offender list, and his lack of criminal charges since 1997. \nweighed these factors against his conviction for sexually abusing his stepdaughter, his \nemployment termination for violating company policy regarding computer usage, and his \ncontinuing interest in viewing sexually provocative images of pre-teenagers on his own \nelectronic devices. \n9 \nI \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nOverall the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant is a 42-year-old employee of a government contractor for whom he has worked since April 2017. He worked for another government contractor from December 2009 until he began his current employment. He earned a high school diploma in 2000 and an associate\u2019s degree in 2008. He has been married since 2016. Applicant has one child who is four years old. (Transcript (Tr.) 31-32, 39-40; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 1, 6) The SOR alleges Applicant\u2019s 15 delinquent debts totaling approximately $53,000. These delinquencies consist of personal loans, credit cards, student loans, and a car loan. Approximately $30,000 of the delinquent debt in the SOR is for student loans. Applicant admitted all of the SOR allegations with additional comment. His admissions are adopted as findings of fact. (Tr. 19-77; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 1-7; AE A- H) Applicant attributed his financial issues to several causes. He admitted that, earlier in his life, he was immature about his financial responsibilities and ignored his debts. He also knowingly spent beyond his means. For example, he took out a $10,000 loan to pay for his wedding which he later defaulted on. He also borrowed $1,200 for his son\u2019s baptism despite being delinquent on other financial obligations.

He worked for another government contractor from December \n2009 until he began his current employment. He earned a high school diploma in 2000 \nand an associate\u2019s degree in 2008. He has been married since 2016. Applicant has one \nchild who is four years old. (Transcript (Tr.) 31-32, 39-40; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; \nGE 1, 6) \nThe SOR alleges Applicant\u2019s 15 delinquent debts totaling approximately $53,000. \nThese delinquencies consist of personal loans, credit cards, student loans, and a car \nloan. Approximately $30,000 of the delinquent debt in the SOR is for student loans. \nApplicant admitted all of the SOR allegations with additional comment. His admissions \nare adopted as findings of fact. (Tr. 19-77; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 1-7; AE A-\nH) \nApplicant attributed his financial issues to several causes. He admitted that, \nearlier in his life, he was immature about his financial responsibilities and ignored his \ndebts. He also knowingly spent beyond his means. For example, he took out a $10,000 \nloan to pay for his wedding which he later defaulted on. He also borrowed $1,200 for his \nson\u2019s baptism despite being delinquent on other financial obligations. Applicant was in a \ncar accident in April 2017 that totaled his car. He could not afford to pay the difference \nbetween what was owed on his car loan and the amount he received from his insurance \ncompany for his totaled car. In 2017, he and his wife had a son who had a milk allergy, \nso he had to spend extra money on special formula that his son could tolerate. He also \ntook on a substantial amount of his wife\u2019s and his in-law\u2019s debt that is not listed in the \nSOR, but has contributed to his inability to cover his expenses.1  Finally, his wife was not \nworking between about 2015 and July 2021, when she began earning a modest and \nsporadic income of no more than $200 per month. (Tr. 19-31, 38-40, 48-51, 54, 58-69, \n70-74; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 1, 6) \nApplicant\u2019s 2019 security interview with his background investigator made him \nrealize that his security clearance was in jeopardy. In about July 2019, after beginning \nthe process to renew his security clearance, and having had his background interview, \nApplicant decided to get his debts under control. He and his wife contacted a debt \nconsolidation company (Company A) and entered into an agreement for Company A to \nnegotiate payments with Applicant\u2019s and his wife\u2019s creditors on their behalf (the \nAgreement). The Agreement allowed Applicant to pay money into an account with \nCompany A. Company A would then draw funds from his account in order to pay \nApplicant\u2019s and his wife\u2019s creditors a monthly amount that it had negotiated with them. \nApplicant is currently paying Company A about $552 per month under the Agreement. \nApplicant and his wife decide which debts and in what order they want Company A to \naddress. Applicant has included some of the SOR debts as part of his rehabilitation \nprogram with Company A, but decided to attempt to resolve some of the SOR debts, \n1 Any adverse information not alleged in the SOR, such as Applicant\u2019s wife\u2019s or in-law\u2019s delinquent debt,\nor his ability to pay it, cannot be used for disqualification purposes.

Out of a sense of moral (not legal) obligation, \nApplicant agreed to pay certain debts that his wife and his in-laws had incurred. The \nSOR debts are in various stages of resolution. Some have been paid for less than the \nfull balance, some are in the process of being paid, and some remain unaddressed. As \nhe finishes paying debts through Company A, Applicant has cycled in other debts for \nCompany A to negotiate and pay. His plan is to continue this approach until he is debt \nfree. His agreement with Company A began in August 2019 and it was to continue for \n53 months. He has provided documents to show that he has paid down or has settled \nsome debts for less than the full amount. Applicant has not prioritized negotiating and \npaying his SOR debts through Company A over his wife\u2019s and his in-law\u2019s debts. (Tr. \n33-38, 40-47, 49, 51-56, 60-67, 70-76; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; AE A-H) \nThe $1,786 credit card debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.a is being resolved by payments \nthrough Company A. Applicant has 25 remaining monthly payments to make out of 47 \ntotal. If he continues to make his payments as scheduled, he will have settled this debt \nthrough payments of $864 in total by the end of July 2024.

With the exception of the debt \nin SOR \u00b6 1.m, which he negotiated and paid on his own, Applicant made his payments \nto these creditors through Company A. (Tr. 22-29, 36-37; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; \nGE 1-6; AE A, G, H) \nThe $1,886 credit card debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.d was settled and paid for an \namount less than the full balance in June 2022. (Tr. 23; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; \nGE 1-6; AE C, G) \nThe $7,040 car loan alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.e has not been resolved. This debt was \nincurred in the aforementioned instance when Applicant\u2019s insurance payment on his \ntotaled vehicle did not cover the full amount of his auto loan. The latest activity date for \nthis debt on any of the credit reports is December 2017. Applicant has not entered into \npayment arrangements with respect to this debt, but plans to pay it when he receives \nhis anticipated 2022 income tax refund sometime in 2023.

(Tr. 29, 47; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; \nGE 1, 4; AE G) \nApplicant submitted earnings statements from his employer for the June 1 \nthrough June 15, 2022 pay period, as well as the June 16 through June 30, 2022 pay \nperiod. Applicant\u2019s hourly pay is $29.58. Both of these earnings statements reflect \nsignificant overtime, which substantially increased Applicant\u2019s earnings. For the first pay \nperiod in June 2022, Applicant worked 15.5 hours of overtime. For the second pay \nperiod in June 2022, he worked 22.5 hours of overtime. His take home income for the \nJune 2022 pay periods was $3,152 and $3,304, respectively. The number of overtime \nhours he normally works per pay period has not been established, but Applicant testified \nthat he makes about $53,000 annually without overtime and between $70,000 and \n$80,000 annually with overtime. Applicant also submitted a budget worksheet as part of \nhis evidence. In it, he lists his and his wife\u2019s monthly income as $7,044. Applicant\u2019s \ntake-home pay in June 2022, as established by his earnings statements, was $6,456 \nand included significant overtime. Applicant\u2019s wife contributes no more than $200 per \nmonth. Therefore, it is unclear how Applicant arrived at the higher figure on his budget \nworksheet, which detracts from its accuracy.

In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds.  \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and  \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant had over a dozen delinquent debts, including Federal student loans, \nthat went unresolved for several years. Many of these delinquent debts remain \nunresolved. The evidence is sufficient to raise AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and 19(c), thereby shifting \nthe burden to Applicant to provide evidence in mitigation. \nConditions that could mitigate the financial considerations security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 20. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment;  \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control; and  \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nApplicant\u2019s financial problems resulted both from conditions within his control and \nbeyond his control. Spending beyond his means, ignoring his financial responsibilities, \nand taking on some of his in-law\u2019s debts were within his control. Applicant\u2019s decision to \naddress some of his in-law\u2019s debts before his own was also within his control. The 2017 \ncar accident and its resultant financial consequences, his son\u2019s health problems, and \nhis wife\u2019s unemployment were beyond Applicant\u2019s control. \nThere is sufficient evidence that the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b, 1.c, 1.d, 1.f, 1.i, \n1.m, and 1.n have been resolved through payment. I find in Applicant\u2019s favor with \nrespect to these debts. The debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.a is being resolved through \npayments. I find in Applicant\u2019s favor with respect to SOR \u00b6 1.a, as well. \nHowever, many of the SOR debts remain unaddressed. Applicant has largely \nignored the student loans listed in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.j and 1.k for over a decade. A security \nclearance represents an obligation to the Federal Government for the protection of \nnational secrets. Accordingly, failure to honor other obligations to the Government has a \ndirect bearing on an Applicant\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified information. ISCR Case No. 14-03358 at 2 (App. Bd. Oct. 9, 2015). While \nthose debts are in a deferment status because of the pandemic, Applicant had already \ndefaulted on them prior to the deferment. When student loans are placed in a deferment \nstatus after they are in default, Applicant\u2019s past inactions are not excused in the context \nof security clearance eligibility. See ISCR Case No. 20-01527 at 2 (App. Bd. June 7, \n2021). \nI also note that Applicant admitted that he began to address his finances after he \nrealized his clearance was in jeopardy. An applicant who begins to resolve security \nconcerns only after having been placed on notice that his or her clearance is in jeopardy \nmay lack the judgment and willingness to follow rules and regulations when his or her \npersonal interests are not threatened. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 17-04110 at 3 (App. \nBd. Sep. 26, 2019). \nOverall, while Applicant has taken significant steps in the right direction to \naddress his financial problems, I have doubts about his ability to continue to repay his \n7 \n\n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ndebts. It is unclear how much Applicant will have to pay on his student loans and other \nunaddressed debts when he begins to make payments on them. While Applicant\u2019s \nbudget worksheet shows a fairly significant monthly surplus, his income amount in that \nworksheet is not supported by other evidence and is significantly impacted by the \narbitrariness of working overtime. The relatively insignificant amount of money he has in \nhis bank accounts in relation to his overall debt also gives me pause about his financial \nstability as well as the accuracy of his budget worksheet. While there is no evidence \nthat he is delinquent, Applicant added to his total indebtedness by opening up two \nadditional credit cards after the SOR was issued. This decision is inconsistent with the \nguidance he was provided by Company A, and tends to undermine his efforts to show \nthat he has reformed his past habit of spending beyond his means. \nThese concerns undermine Applicant\u2019s ability to show that his financial issues \nare unlikely to recur. The timing of his efforts to meaningfully address his debts detracts \nfrom showing those efforts were made in good faith and, to the extent his delinquencies \nwere beyond his control, whether he acted responsibly under the circumstances. His \nfinancial issues continue to cast doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, and \ngood judgment. The financial considerations security concerns are not mitigated. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n(1) The nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude Applicant did not \nmitigate the financial considerations security concerns. \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                      \n                          \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.d: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.e:  \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.f: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.g-1.h: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.i: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.k-1.l: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.m-1.n: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.o: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIt is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for \na security clearance.

She attended college off and on since 1989. She earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in 2006. She married in 2002 and divorced in 2005. She has a 19-year-old child. (Tr. at 55-56, 62-67, 74; GE 1; AE H) The SOR alleges two defaulted student loans totaling about $85,000; four unpaid judgments totaling about $16,500; five delinquent medical debts totaling about $1,850; three miscellaneous delinquent debts totaling about $2,000; and failure to file her federal and state income tax returns for tax years 2016 and 2018. Except as addressed below, the allegations are established through credit reports, court records, and Applicant\u2019s admissions. Applicant attributed her financial problems to her 2005 divorce after her ex- husband abandoned her and their infant child, and he did not pay child support.

She stated that she did not think that she was required to \nfile a return if she was due a refund. An IRS account transcript shows that the IRS \nreceived her 2018 tax return in October 2021. Her total income was $11,577, and her \nadjusted gross income was $11,222. Because her gross income for 2018 was less than \n$12,000, she was not required to file a federal tax return for that year. (IRS Publication \n501 for 2018) The same is true for her state return. She would have been due a refund \nof $541, but it was withheld and applied towards her federal taxes owed for 2017. She \nstated that she still owed the IRS about $2,500 and some amount to her state for tax \nyear 2017.1 (Tr. at 26-40, 82-86, 92-96; AE A, C) \nApplicant submitted an IRS wage and income transcript for tax year 2016. A \nwage and income transcript is a different document than an account transcript, which is \nwhat she submitted for tax year 2018. Her wages, tips, and other compensation was \n$31,123, so she was required to file an income tax return. She testified that she would \nhave been due a refund of $3,067 if she filed on time. Any refund she would have \nreceived was forfeited because the return was not filed within three years of the normal \nfiling date. Applicant was informed at her hearing that the wage and income transcript \ndid not show that she filed a return. She held up what was apparently a 2016 return. \nShe was told that she could submit proof after the hearing that she filed her 2016 \nreturns. She submitted a document from the IRS showing that the balance due (likely \nfrom 2017) was $1,848. After receipt of her post-hearing documents, she was again \ninformed that she did not submit proof that she filed her 2016 returns. She did not \nsubmit any additional documents proving that she filed the 2016 returns. (Tr. at 26-27, \n33-34, 84-85; AE A, B, I, S-U) \nA default judgment of $198 plus $56 costs was entered against Applicant on \nbehalf of a fitness club in October 2011 (SOR \u00b6 1.c). She stated that she unaware of the \ndebt until she received the SOR. She attempted to contact the company to pay the debt, \nbut the business had changed hands, and the new owner was not in a position to \naccept payments. (Tr. at 97-99; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 3) \nApplicant was sued for unlawful detainer in February 2016. A default judgment of \n$2,746, plus $700 attorney fees, and $178 costs and other fees was entered against her \non behalf of a landlord in March 2017 (SOR \u00b6 1.e).

(AE E) \nPolicies \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG), which became \neffective on June 8, 2017. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds.  \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts;  \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired. \nApplicant has a history of financial problems, including defaulted student loans, \nunpaid judgments, and delinquent debts. AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and 19(c) are applicable. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant did not file her 2016 federal and state income tax returns when they \nwere due. AG \u00b6 19(f) is applicable. She did not file her federal and state income tax \nreturns for tax year 2018 until September or October 2021. Because her gross income \nfor 2018 was less than $12,000, she was not required to file a federal tax return for that \nyear. (IRS Publication 501 for 2018) The same is true for her state return. AG \u00b6 19(f) is \nnot applicable to the 2018 returns. The language in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b that refers to \ntax year 2018 is concluded for Applicant. \nConditions that could mitigate the financial considerations security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 20. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment;  \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control;  \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax \nauthority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \nA number of events beyond Applicant\u2019s control contributed to her financial \nproblems, including her divorce, her ex-husband\u2019s failure to pay child support, her and \nher child\u2019s health problems, unemployment, and underemployment. AG \u00b6 20(b) also \nrequires that \u201cthe individual acted responsibly under the circumstances.\u201d \nApplicant\u2019s testimony and her documentation were somewhat disjointed and \nconfusing. Some of her claims were not supported by documentation, even though the \nrecord was held open and extended several times. The Appeal Board has held that \u201cit is \nreasonable for a Judge to expect applicants to present documentation about the \nsatisfaction of specific debts.\u201d See ISCR Case No. 09-07091 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 11, \n2010) (quoting ISCR Case No. 04-10671 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2006)).

I have therefore given her credit without \ndocumentation on some allegations. \nApplicant was told multiple times that her documentation (IRS wage and income \ntranscript instead of an IRS account transcript) did not establish that her 2016 tax \nreturns had been filed, but she never submitted the correct documentation. Applicant \nknew that her unfiled returns were an issue when she submitted her SF 86 in February \n2019; when she was interviewed in April 2019; when she responded to interrogatories in \nFebruary 2020; and when she responded to the SOR in December 2020. I accept \nwithout documentation that her federal and state income tax returns for 2016 were filed \nin September or October 2021. AG \u00b6 20(g) is applicable to the filed income tax returns \nfor 2016, but that does not end the discussion. \nApplicant testified that she would have been due a refund of $3,067 if she filed \nher 2016 federal tax return on time. If she was due a refund, it was forfeited. Her failure \nto file tax returns, whether she owed taxes or was due a refund, cannot be considered \nresponsible behavior. \nFailure to comply with tax laws suggests that an applicant has a problem with \nabiding by well-established government rules and systems. Voluntary compliance with \nrules and systems is essential for protecting classified information. See, e.g., ISCR \nCase No. 16-01726 at 5 (App. Bd. Feb. 28, 2018). A person who fails repeatedly to fulfill \nhis or her legal obligations, such as filing tax returns and paying taxes when due, does \nnot demonstrate the high degree of good judgment and reliability required of those \ngranted access to classified information. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 17-01382 at 4 (App. \nBd. May 16, 2018). This may be true even when the returns are eventually filed. \nThe timing of ameliorative action is a factor that should be brought to bear in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s case for mitigation. An applicant who begins to resolve \nsecurity concerns only after having been placed on notice that his or her clearance is in \njeopardy may lack the judgment and willingness to follow rules and regulations when his \nor her personal interests are not threatened. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 17-04110 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Sep. 26, 2019). \nAs to her other financial issues, I am satisfied that the five delinquent medical \ndebts totaling about $1,850 and the three miscellaneous delinquent debts totaling about \n$2,000 have been resolved. Those debts are mitigated. I also find that the small \njudgment from 2011 no longer has any security significance. That is also mitigated. \nEven with those matters resolved, Applicant still has about $85,000 in student \nloans, more than $16,000 in judgments, and federal and state income taxes for 2017 to \nbe paid. The student loans are deferred as part of COVID-19 relief, but they will have to \nbe addressed at some point. \nApplicant asserted that her finances have improved, and she plans to pay her \ndebts. However, intentions to resolve financial problems in the future are not a \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nsubstitute for a track record of debt repayment or other responsible approaches. See \nISCR Case No. 11-14570 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct. 23, 2013). \nThere is insufficient evidence for a determination that Applicant\u2019s financial \nproblems will be resolved within a reasonable period. I am unable to find that she acted \nresponsibly under the circumstances or that she made a good-faith effort to pay her \ndebts. Her financial issues are recent and ongoing. They continue to cast doubt on her \ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. I find that financial \nconsiderations security concerns remain despite the presence of some mitigation. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. I also considered Applicant\u2019s \nfavorable character evidence. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude Applicant did not \nmitigate the financial considerations security concerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.b: \nAgainst \nApplicant \n(except \nfor \nthe \nlanguage \u201cand 2018,\u201d which is found for \nApplicant) \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nSubparagraph 1.c: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.d-1.f: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.g-1.k: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.l-1.m: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.n-1.p: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIt is not clearly consistent with the national interest to continue Applicant\u2019s \neligibility for a security clearance.

Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nStatement of the Case \nOn April 22, 2020, the Defense Counterintelligence and Security Agency issued to \nApplicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security concerns under Guideline B, \nforeign influence. The action was taken under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of \nDefense (DOD) Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance \nReview Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative \nguidelines (AG) effective within the DOD on June 8, 2017. \nApplicant answered the SOR on February 6, 2021, and requested a hearing before \nan administrative judge. The case was assigned to me on February 18, 2022. The \nDefense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a notice of hearing on March 15, \n2022.

DOHA \nreceived the hearing transcript on April 13, 2022. \nRequest for Administrative Notice \nThe Government provided relevant documents (HE I) and requested \nadministrative notice be taken of certain facts about Iraq. Without objection, I have taken \nadministrative notice of the facts contained in the request. The facts are summarized in \nthe written request and will not be repeated verbatim in this decision. Of particular note is \nthe significant threat of terrorism and ongoing human rights problems in Iraq. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant admitted all of the allegations in the SOR and they are incorporated in \nthe findings of fact. After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings, testimony, and \nexhibits submitted, I make the following findings of fact. \nApplicant is 56 years old. He was born in Iraq. In 1988, he earned a bachelor\u2019s of \nlaw degree from a university in Iraq. He married in 1996. His eldest child was born in Iraq. \nIn 1999, Applicant refused to join the Bathe party in Iraq, subjecting him to possible \nimprisonment or death by the Saddam Hussein regime. That same year Applicant, his \nwife who was pregnant at the time, and their child fled Iraq to Syria where they were \nrefugees. His second child was born in Syria. In March 2001, through a United Nations \nprogram, he and his family immigrated to the United States. He has worked for different \nfederal contractors, as a teacher of Arabic languages, since 2009, and has worked for his \ncurrent employer, also a defense contractor, since 2017. (Transcript (Tr.) 20-26) \nApplicant and his family became naturalized U.S. citizens in March 2001. He \ndisclosed on his October 2015 security clearance application (SCA) that he does not \npossess an Iraqi passport because of his escape to Syria. He does possess a U.S. \npassport. During his background interview with a government investigator he stated that \nhe maintains dual citizenship with the United States and Iraq. At his hearing, he confirmed \nhe is a dual citizen and he intends to maintain his Iraqi citizenship so he can retain his \nright to inherit family property that was left to him and his siblings by their father who \npassed away about 20 years ago. His brother currently lives in the house rent-free. Under \nShi\u2019a law the men are entitled to an equal share and the women are entitled to a half \nshare of the proceeds of the house. He estimated the house was worth about $500,000. \n(Tr. 44-54) \nApplicant has three sisters and a brother who are citizens and residents of Iraq. \nHe has asked his brother to sell the house so they can split the proceeds in accordance \nwith the law. His sisters also want the brother to sell the house, so they can receive their \ninheritance. Applicant stated that he has asked his brother to complete the sale in the \nnext one to two years. He told him if he has financial difficulty after selling the house, he \nwill help him out, but it is not fair he has lived in the house for so long and deprived the \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nsiblings of their inheritance. If his brother refuses, he will have to take him to court. He \nwould prefer not to have to go to court. Applicant testified that he will maintain his \ncitizenship ties to Iraq until after his brother resolves the house issue. He does not know \nwhat he will do regarding his citizenship when the house issue is resolved. (Tr. 26-30, 44-\n54; GE 1) \nApplicant\u2019s brother is a retired port employee. His eldest sister is a widow with \ngrown children, who works for a university library. His middle sister is a principal of a high \nschool, and his youngest sister is a homemaker. His siblings all have families. Applicant \nhelps his siblings financially when they need it. He explained that their income is \nsignificantly less than he earns. He helps his eldest sister the most. Her husband was \nassassinated by terrorists in 2005. None of his family have visited him in the United \nStates. The SOR alleged that Applicant\u2019s father-in-law is a citizen and resident of Iraq. \nHe passed away about two years ago. (Tr. 26-32) \nApplicant returned to Iraq with his family in 2004 so they could visit both his and \nhis wife\u2019s family. He again took his family to Iraq in 2009 to visit family. He went back on \nhis own in 2013, 2017, 2019, and December of 2021. His purpose was to visit his family \nand friends. He also stays in regular contact with his family by phone. He has friends and \ncolleagues that work in the legal system, including attorneys and judges, with whom he \nworked for ten years. He also visits them while he is in Iraq. (Tr. 27-34) \nApplicant testified that his siblings do not know what his job is in the United States. \nHe intentionally shields them from this knowledge to keep them safe. He tells them he is \na teacher at a school. He does not disclose to any of his Iraqi friends that he works as a \nteacher for a defense contractor. He believes his family and friends are now safe in Iraq, \nbut he wants to ensure their continued safety. He stated there is still a concern from rogue \nmilitia, so the best way to keep his family safe is to not tell them anything about his job. \n(Tr. 60-63) \nApplicant was asked if he has a concern about people in Iraq knowing how he \nescaped to Syria. He stated he does not share his story with anyone there. His family \nknows how he left, but no one else. When he visits Iraq, the people in the neighborhood \nwhere he used to live no longer recognize him. His colleagues at the court and friends \nrecognize him and he engages with them when he is visiting the country. (Tr. 60-63) \nApplicant was a lawyer in Iraq. When Saddam Hussein was in power, Applicant\u2019s \nname was removed from the active lawyer rolls. In 2009, when he returned to Iraq, he \npetitioned to be reinstated. His petition was granted and since then Applicant has paid \nthe annual membership fees to maintain his law license there. He sends the money to his \nsister, who then gives it to his friends who then pay the dues. He intends to maintain his \nlaw license in the future. (Tr. 34-38) \nIn 2008, Applicant and his family were provided with a house from Habitat for \nHumanity. He is required to pay the interest-free mortgage on the home for 20 years. \nOnce he completes this period of payments he will own the house outright.

His younger child is attending college, \nand also lives at home. They received scholarships to fund their education. (Tr. 38-41, \n48-49) \nApplicant plans to retire in the United States. He is grateful and loyal to the United \nStates for accepting his family as immigrants. In 2005, he was asked by a representative \nof the United Nations to help Iraqis living in the United States participate in the voting \nprocess in their country\u2019s election. He was a paid full-time worker and helped in various \ncapacities. He voted in this election and was not yet a citizen of the United States. He \nagain voted in the Iraqi elections in 2014, while living in the United States, and subsequent \nto becoming a naturalized U.S. citizen, in hopes of improving the country. (Tr. 54-59) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility, the administrative judge \nmust consider the AG. In addition to brief introductory explanations for each guideline, \nthe adjudicative guidelines list potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating \nconditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified \ninformation. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere \nspeculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 states an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information).  \nAnalysis \nGuideline B: Foreign Influence \nAG \u00b6 6 expresses the security concern regarding foreign influence: \nForeign contacts and interests, including, but not limited to, business, \nfinancial, and property interests, are a national security concern if they \nresulted in divided allegiance. They may also be a national security concern \nif they create circumstances in which the individual may be manipulated or \ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a \nway inconsistent with U.S. interests or otherwise made vulnerable to \npressure or coercion by any foreign interest. Assessment of foreign contacts \nand interests should consider the country in which the foreign contact or \ninterest is located, including, but not limited to, considerations such as \nwhether it is known to target U.S. citizens to obtain classified or sensitive \ninformation or is it associated with a risk of terrorism. \nAG \u00b6 7 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. I have considered all of them and the following are potentially applicable: \n(a) contact, regardless of method, with a foreign family member, business \nor professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or \nresident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of \nforeign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion;  \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual\u2019s obligation to \nprotect classified or sensitive information or technology and the individual\u2019s \ndesire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing that \ninformation; and \n(f) substantial business, financial, or property interests in a foreign country, \nor in any foreign owned or foreign-operated business that could subject the \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nindividual to a heightened risk of foreign influence or exploitation or personal \nconflict of interest.  \nAG \u00b6 7(a) and 7(f) require evidence of a \u201cheightened risk.\u201d The \u201cheightened risk\u201d \nrequired to raise these disqualifying conditions is a relatively low standard. \u201cHeightened \nrisk\u201d denotes a risk greater than the normal risk inherent in having a family member living \nunder a foreign government or owning property in a foreign country. The totality of \nApplicant\u2019s family ties to a foreign country as well as each individual family tie must be \nconsidered. \nApplicant\u2019s brother and three sisters are citizens and residents of Iraq. Applicant\u2019s \nbrother is a retired port worker. It is unknown if he receives a government pension. His \neldest sister works in a university library, middle sister is a principal, and youngest sister \nis a homemaker. Applicant visits his family in Iraq regularly and is in regular contact with \nthem by phone. Applicant has ties of affection to them. Applicant also regularly visits \nfriends and colleagues from his legal profession when he visits Iraq. His family ties and \nrelationship with friends and colleagues in Iraq create a heightened risk and a potential \nforeign influence concern. \nApplicant inherited a share of his father\u2019s house where his brother currently \nresides. He indicated he must retain his Iraqi citizenship in order to receive his share of \nthe inheritance when his brother sells the house. It has been 20 years since his father \npassed away and although Applicant is pressuring his brother to resolve the inheritance, \nit is unclear when that will occur. Applicant intends to go to court if his brother does not \nshare in the inheritance. This issue could create strife with his brother. Applicant \nmaintains his law license in Iraq and intends to do so in the future. He has been paying \nhis membership dues since approximately 2009. He visits his friends and colleagues at \nthe court and maintains a personal and professional relationship with them when he is in \nIraq. AG \u00b6 7(a), 7(b) and 7(f) apply. \nThere is a significant threat of terrorism and ongoing human rights problems in \nIraq. Applicant\u2019s foreign contacts create a potential conflict of interest and a heightened \nrisk of foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, and coercion. The above \ndisqualifying conditions have been raised by the evidence.  \nAfter the Government produced substantial evidence of those disqualifying \nconditions, the burden shifted to Applicant to rebut them or otherwise prove mitigation. \nThe following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 8 are potentially applicable: \n(a) the nature of the relationship with foreign persons, the country in which \nthese persons are located, or the positions or activities of those persons in \nthat country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be placed in a \nposition of having to choose between the interests of a foreign individual, \ngroup, organization and interests of the U.S.;  \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of \nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, group, government, or country is \nso minimal, or the individual has such deep and longstanding relationships \nand loyalties in the U.S., that the individual can be expected to resolve any \nconflict of interests in favor of the U.S. interests;  \n(c) contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and \ninfrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign \ninfluence or exploitation; and  \n(f) the value or routine nature of the foreign business, financial, or property \ninterests is such that they are unlikely to result in a conflict and could not be \nused effectively to influence, manipulate, or pressure the individual.  \nApplicant credibly and sincerely professed his appreciation and loyalty towards his \nadopted country. He is grateful for the opportunities that the United States has afforded \nhim and his family. It is also evident that he has significant and deep ties to his family, \nfriends, and colleagues in Iraq. He maintains regular communication, visits them, and \nhelps his family financially when needed. He identifies himself as a dual-citizen of Iraq \nand is pursuing his inheritance from his father, and if necessary will go to court to enforce \nit. The property value is significant and important to Applicant. He is willing to pursue legal \naction against his brother if necessary. His ties are not casual and infrequent. AG \u00b6 8(c) \ndoes not apply. \nApplicant\u2019s relationship with the United States must be weighed against the \npotential conflict of interest created by his relationships with relatives, friends, and \ncolleagues who are citizens and residents of Iraq. Like every other resident of Iraq, any \nof his relatives who may be living in Iraq are at risk from terrorists. He intentionally shields \nthem from information about him to protect them due to rogue elements that exist in the \ncountry. \nI believe Applicant is a loyal American. He has worked in the United States for a \ndefense contractor. However, his close family ties, close ties to the friends and colleagues \nin the legal community in Iraq, and his financial interests are such that he could be placed \nin a position of having to choose between them and the United States. His sense of loyalty \ntowards his family, friends, and colleagues could create a conflict of interest. I have also \nconsidered Applicant\u2019s significant ties to the United States. It would be too great of a \nburden for Applicant to have to choose between protecting family and friends in Iraq over \nthose of the United States. Applicant clearly identifies with his homeland and has diligently \nmaintained both familial and professional relationships in Iraq. He continues to nurture \nhis relationship with his professional colleagues in Iraq. He continues to pursue his rightful \ninheritance and is willing to take the matter to court if his brother fails to sell their father\u2019s \nproperty. This may cause a family strife and this conflict could make Applicant vulnerable \nand subject to pressure. I find the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6\u00b6 8(a), 8(b) and 8(f) \ndo not apply. \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline B in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were \naddressed under that guideline, but some warrant additional comment. \nApplicant is a loyal American citizen who is grateful to the United States for the \nopportunities it has provided to him and his family. He has worked for a defense contractor \nteaching Arabic languages. He is also a good family man and has stayed in close contact \nwith his siblings in Iraq and has helped them financially over the years. He calls them on \nthe phone regularly and visits them. He has stayed in contact with legal colleagues and \nfriends in Iraq and also visits them. He maintains his law license in Iraq and intends to do \nso in the future. He also has a financial interest in the inheritance of his father\u2019s home, \nwhich his brother has lived in since his father\u2019s passing 20 years ago. Applicant clearly \nintends to ensure his inheritance interests and that of his sisters are fulfilled and is willing \nto take the matter to court. The continued terrorist threats and human rights issues in Iraq \nare significant. Applicant has not met his burden of persuasion. The security concerns \nraised under Guideline B, foreign influence are not mitigated. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline B: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.b: \nAgainst Applicant \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nSubparagraph   1.c:  \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.d-1.e: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national security to grant Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security \nclearance.

Department Counsel \nprovided a nine-page summary of the facts, supported by 15 Government documents \npertaining to Pakistan, which I have collectively identified as Item 6. The documents \nprovide elaboration and context for the summary. I take administrative notice of the facts \nincluded in the U.S. Government reports.

He was born in Pakistan in 1962, entered the United \nStates in 1990, and became a naturalized American citizen in 2009. He is married to his \nsecond wife, who is a Legal Permanent Resident. He has two American-born children \nfrom his first wife. He has a bachelor\u2019s degree and a master\u2019s degree, and has been \nemployed by a defense contractor as an engineer since 2018. He wishes to obtain \nnational security eligibility in connection with his employment. Applicant has not \npreviously applied for national security eligibility. (Item 2 at 43-44; Item 4 at Sections 12, \n13A, 17, 18, and 25.) \n1.a and 1.b. Applicant has one brother and four sisters. His parents are deceased. \nAll of his siblings live in Pakistan. Two of his sisters are married. His brother, who is \ndisabled, lives with the other two sisters in the house that belonged to his parents. (Item \n2 at 1-18.) \nApplicant speaks with his brother, and the two sisters the brother lives with, on a \nweekly basis. He communicates with his other two sisters on a monthly basis. In Applicant \nExhibit A he stated, \u201c[W]hat is wrong if I am close to my family (Sibling)?\u201d (Item 4 at \nSection 18.) \nApplicant has visited Pakistan several times since becoming an American citizen. \nThe last trip of which the Government has knowledge occurred in 2017. (Item 4 at Section \n20C; Item 5 at 4.) \n1.c and 1.d. Applicant admitted that he has been sending money to Pakistan for \nthe support of his handicapped brother and the sisters he lives with since approximately \n2004. None of the three of them are employed. He sent the money to one of his brothers-\nin-law until he passed away in 2018. Applicant then began sending the money to his \nnephew. Applicant provided financial records showing he sent approximately $3,600 to \nPakistan in 2020. In Applicant Exhibit A he stated, \u201c{W}hat is wrong if I am sending money \nto my family for medical reason?\u201d He also stated, \u201cI am the primary provider for my family \nthat still resides in Pakistan, and this is an important role that my family needs me to \ncontinue in order for them to sustain a proper livelihood.\u201d (Item 2 at 21-39; Item 5 at 3-4.) \nPakistan \nI take administrative notice of the facts set forth in Item 6. Pakistan is a \nparliamentary federal republic, created in 1947 after British India was partitioned when \nthe British government granted India its independence. Pakistan was created for the \nMoslem population of the Indian sub-continent. Its population is about 170 million. After \nSeptember 11, 2001, Pakistan reassessed its relations with the Taliban and supported \nthe U.S. and international coalition in its efforts to remove the Taliban from power. Many \nIslamic extremists and terrorists are known to inhabit parts of Pakistan, leading to a \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ngrowth of their insurgency. Although Pakistan has intensified its efforts to deal with the \nviolence and terrorists, the country continues to experience serious problems. The U.S. \nDepartment of State confirms that many border cities are known as safe havens for \nterrorists. Numerous suicide bombings and kidnappings have taken place over many \nyears. Human rights violations continue to be a significant problem, as killings, torture, \nand disappearances remain prevalent. The Pakistani government maintains domestic \nintelligence surveillance activities. The U.S. government warns Americans against travel \nto Pakistan, including specific concerns about travel to the city where Applicant\u2019s family \nlives. (Item 6 at Attachment VIII.) \nApplicant Exhibit A contains several photographs and accompanying descriptions \nfrom the press office of the United States Embassy in Pakistan dating from September 7, \n2021, through December 2, 2021. Applicant argues that these documents show that \nPakistan is a safe place to visit and live. The subjects involve such normal diplomatic \nactivities as military-to-military relations, support for law enforcement, and improvement \nof economic and cultural ties between the two countries.

In addition to brief introductory explanations \nfor each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines (AG) list potentially disqualifying conditions \nand mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s national \nsecurity eligibility. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. The entire \nprocess is a conscientious scrutiny of applicable guidelines in the context of a number of \nvariables known as the whole-person concept. The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires, \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. I have not drawn inferences based on mere speculation or \nconjecture. \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.14 requires the Government to present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, \u201cThe applicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants national \nsecurity eligibility. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the \napplicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as \nto potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified or sensitive information. \nFinally, as emphasized in Section 7 of Executive Order 10865, \u201cAny determination \nunder this order adverse to an applicant shall be a determination in terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d (Emphasis supplied.) See also Executive Order 12968, Section \n3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information.) \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAnalysis \nParagraph 1 (Guideline B \u2013 Foreign Influence) \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Foreign Influence is set out in AG \n\u00b6 6: \nForeign contacts and interests, including, but not limited to, business, \nfinancial, and property interests, are a national security concern if they result \nin divided allegiance. They may also be a national security concern if they \ncreate circumstances in which the individual may be manipulated or induced \nto help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a way \ninconsistent with U.S. interests or otherwise made vulnerable to pressure \nor coercion by any foreign interest. Assessment of foreign contacts and \ninterests should consider the country in which the foreign contact or interest \nis located, including, but not limited to, considerations such as whether it is \nknown to target U.S. citizens to obtain classified or sensitive information or \nis associated with a risk of terrorism. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 7. Two are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) contact, regardless of method, with a foreign family member, business \nor professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or \nresident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of \nforeign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual's obligation to \nprotect classified or sensitive information or technology and the individual's \ndesire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing that \ninformation or technology. \nApplicant is originally from Pakistan and five of his family members reside there. \nHe sends money to Pakistan to help support several members of his family. The evidence \nis sufficient to raise these disqualifying conditions. \nAG \u00b6 8 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. I considered all \nof the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 8 including: \n(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in which \nthese persons are located, or the positions or activities of those persons in \nthat country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be placed in a \nposition of having to choose between the interests of a foreign individual, \ngroup, organization, or government and the interests of the United States; \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of \nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, or allegiance to the group, \ngovernment, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such deep and \nlongstanding relationships and loyalties in the United States, that the \nindividual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the \nU.S. interest; and \n(c) contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and \ninfrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign \ninfluence or exploitation. \nThe Government is not alleging that Applicant is anything other than a \nconscientious and patriotic American citizen and member of the defense industry. \nHowever, he has substantial family ties to Pakistan. He admits to weekly to monthly \ncontact with his four sisters and one brother who continue to live in Pakistan. For over \nfifteen years he has sent money to his family members in Pakistan for their support. \nThere is little evidence in the record concerning Applicant\u2019s connections to the \nUnited States. I have considered the fact that he has lived here for over 30 years and that \nhe has been a citizen for over ten years. I have also considered the facts of his long-term \nemployment in the United States, his education here, and his volunteer work. Finally, I \nhave considered the fact that his wife is a Legal Permanent Resident and his children are \nnative-born American citizens. \nI have considered both the Government\u2019s administrative notice documents and \nApplicant\u2019s documentation found in Applicant Exhibit A. The documents show that the \nUnited States and Pakistan are engaged in normal diplomatic relations between \ncountries. However, his exhibit does not overcome the State Department\u2019s warnings \nabout travel to Pakistan in general, and specifically travel to his home town. \nThe DOHA Appeal Board has repeatedly stated that the mere possession of close \nfamily ties with a person in a foreign country is not, as a matter of law, disqualifying under \nGuideline B. However, if only one relative lives in a foreign country and an applicant has \ncontacts with that relative, that factor alone is sufficient to create the potential for foreign \ninfluence and could potentially result in the compromise of classified information. (See \nISCR Case No. 03-02382 at 5 (App. Bd. Feb. 15, 2006; ISCR Case No. 99-0424 (App. \nBd. Feb. 8, 2001). Given Applicant\u2019s strong family connections, the current state of the \nrecord, and also considering Pakistan\u2019s human rights record and State Department travel \nwarnings, Applicant has not met his burden of mitigating the security concerns under \nGuideline B. Accordingly, Paragraph 1 is found against Applicant. \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \nAccording to AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant national \nsecurity eligibility must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the applicable guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \npertinent facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant did not provide \nsufficient evidence to overcome the facts of his deep and abiding ties to family members \nin Pakistan. The potential for pressure, exploitation, or duress has not been resolved. \nOverall, the evidence creates substantial doubt as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility, and suitability \nfor a security clearance. Applicant has not met his burden to mitigate the security \nconcerns arising under the guideline for foreign influence. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline B: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a through 1.d: \nAgainst Applicant \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant national security eligibility \nand a security clearance.

The dates of his use of Edibles are \nDecember 2017, June 2018, and August 2019. His last use of an Edible or any illegal \ndrug was August 2019. He used the Edibles as a sleep aid on three occasions after \u201chigh\u00ad\nexertion\u201d days and evenings of mountain-climbing activity so that he could sleep on a mat \non the ground. He has never purchased an Edible or any other illegal drugs. (GE 1 at 54; \nTr. at 26-31, 36-38,) \nPrior to 2017, Applicant experimented with marijuana one or two times when he \nwas in college (2004-2007). He has not used any illegal drugs at any other times. (Tr. at \n28-33.) \nHe reported in his e-QIP his use of THC during the preceding seven years. He also \nreported his college use of marijuana in his original security clearance application when \nhe started working for his employer in 2007.

Through the process of \nthe adjudication of his clearance application, he now has a clear understanding of security \nclearance rules. He wrote in his Answer and testified that he has no future intent to use \nillegal drugs. (Tr. at 31-33.) \nMitigation \nApplicant provided a statement of his personal history that emphasized his \ncharitable work and athletic activities while in high school and college. His statement also \nexpressed his pride in working for an important defense contractor for the past 15 years. \nHe wrote that he has been rated as a \u201chigh performer\u201d in each of those years.

He also praised Applicant in glowing terms. (AE C; \nAE D.) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for national security eligibility, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines (AG) list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. The entire \nprocess is a conscientious scrutiny of applicable guidelines in the context of a number of \nvariables known as the whole-person concept. The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires, \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. I have not drawn inferences based on mere speculation or \nconjecture. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants national \nsecurity eligibility. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the \napplicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as \nto potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified or sensitive information. \nFinally, as emphasized in Section 7 of Executive Order 10865, \u201cAny determination under \nthis order adverse to an applicant shall be a determination in terms of the national interest \nand shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nSee also Executive Order 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information.) \nAnalysis \nParagraph 1 (Guideline H, Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse) \nThe security concerns relating to the guideline for drug involvement and substance \nmisuse are set out in AG \u00b6 24, which reads as follows: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior may \nlead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. Controlled substance means any \u201ccontrolled substance\u201d as \ndefined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term adopted in \nthis guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above.      \nAG \u00b6 25 describes two conditions that could raise security concerns and may be \ndisqualifying in this case: \n(a) any substance misuse (see above definition); and \n(f) any illegal drug use while granted access to classified information or \nholding a sensitive position. \nApplicant\u2019s admissions in his Answer, and his detailed testimony regarding his \nhistory of drug use, establish both of the above disqualifying conditions and shift the \nburden to Applicant to mitigate the security concerns raised by his conduct. \nThe guideline includes two conditions in AG \u00b6 26 that could mitigate the security \nconcerns arising from Applicant\u2019s alleged drug involvement and substance misuse: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; and \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and substance \nmisuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome the problem, and \nhas established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not limited to: \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all \ndrug involvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that \nany future involvement or misuse is grounds for revocation of \nnational security eligibility. \nBoth of the above mitigating conditions fully apply. Applicant\u2019s last drug use \noccurred more than two years ago and was under unusual circumstances. Also, his drug \nuse was very infrequent. Now that he knows that his use of Edibles is inconsistent with \nthe requirements for holding a security clearance, his behavior is unlikely to recur. \nMoreover, his past behavior does not cast doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, \nand good judgment. \nIn my mitigation analysis, I have also taken administrative notice of the Security \nExecutive Agent \u201cClarifying Guidance Concerning Marijuana for Individuals Eligible to \nAccess Classified Information or Eligible to Hold a Sensitive Position,\u201d dated December \n21, 2021 (Guidance). In her Guidance, the Security Executive Agent (SecEA) noted the \nincreased number of states that have legalized or decriminalized the use of marijuana. \nShe reaffirmed SecEA\u2019s 2014 memorandum regarding the importance of compliance with \nFederal law on the illegality of the use of marijuana by holders of security clearances. She \nprovided further clarification of Federal marijuana policy writing that this policy remains \nrelevant to security clearance adjudications \u201cbut [is] not determinative.\u201d She noted that \nthe adjudicative guidelines provided various opportunities for a clearance applicant to \nmitigate security concerns raised by his or her past use of marijuana. (Guidance at 1.) \nSecEA also addressed in her Guidance the issue of the use of CBD products by \nholders of security clearances. She commented that the use of CBD products may also \nbe relevant to eligibility adjudications. SecEA explained, however, that only CBD products \ncontaining more than \u201c0.3 percent THC continue to meet the legal definition of marijuana, \nand therefore remain illegal to use under federal law and policy.\u201d She noted the risks \ninvolved in the use of CBD products under the adjudicative guidelines because the \nadvertised THC percentages of CBD products are not necessarily reliable and the use of \nCBD products may result in a positive drug test for marijuana. (Guidance at 2.) \nFollowing careful consideration of the disqualifying and mitigating evidence, as well \nas SecEA\u2019s recent clarifying guidance regarding Federal policy concerning marijuana, I \nconclude that Applicant has mitigated the security concerns raised by his use of CBD \nproducts. Paragraph 1 is found in favor of Applicant. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nParagraph 2 (Guideline E, Personal Conduct) \nThe security concerns relating to the guideline for personal conduct are set out in \nAG \u00b6 15, which states: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. \nAG \u00b6 16 describes a condition that could raise security concerns and may be \ndisqualifying in this case: \n(c) credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is \nnot sufficient for an adverse determination under any other single guideline, \nbut which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-person \nassessment of questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack \nof candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations, or other \ncharacteristics indicating that the individual may not properly safeguard \nclassified or sensitive information. \nApplicant used Edibles containing THC three times during the years 2017 to 2019. \nDuring that time, he was employed by a defense contractor and held a security clearance. \nThe above disqualifying condition has application to this case. \nThe guideline includes a condition in AG \u00b6 17 that could mitigate the security \nconcerns arising from Applicant\u2019s use of CBD products and his use of marijuana while \nholding a security clearance: \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment. \nApplicant provided credible testimony that he was uncertain about any restrictions \non the use of CBD products while holding a security clearance. Once he learned that such \nuse was restricted, he ceased using Edibles with THC, including when he engaged in \nmountain climbing. There is no evidence of further drug use since August 2019. Applicant \nevinced a credible intent not to use marijuana/THC or any other illegal drugs in the future \nand provided a written statement to that effect. Applicant has successfully mitigated the \nsecurity concerns raised by his personal conduct. Accordingly, paragraph 2 of the SOR \nis found in favor of Applicant. \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for national security eligibility by considering the totality of the \napplicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should \nconsider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant national security eligibility \nfor a security clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \npertinent facts and circumstances surrounding this case, including the whole-person \nfactors quoted above. Applicant has mitigated the security concerns raised by his past \nuse of CBD containing THC. Overall, the record evidence does not create any questions \nor doubts as to Applicant\u2019s present suitability for national security eligibility and a security \nclearance. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline H:  \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a and 1.b: \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 2.a: \nFor Applicant \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                \n \n \n \n \n \n \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s national security \neligibility for a security clearance.

He received refunds each year. \nHis state certified that he is in good standing. (Tr. at 33-34; GE 2; AE C, D, H-J) \nApplicant accepted responsibility for his tax failures and poor judgment. He has a \ngood job with a stable income. He completed a financial counseling course. His \nfinances are currently in good shape, and he is aware that neglecting his tax obligations \nin the future could jeopardize his security clearance and his job. He found the process \nof using a tax professional easy, and he is no longer forfeiting thousands of dollars in \nrefunds. He credibly stated that he has learned a valuable and costly lesson, and all \nfuture tax returns will be filed on time.

He is praised for his honesty, \ntrustworthiness, judgment, dedication, work ethic, and diligent handling of classified \ninformation. (Tr. at 36-43; GE 2; AE A, E, L) \nPolicies \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG), which became \neffective on June 8, 2017. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds.  \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. The following is potentially applicable in this case: \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired. \nApplicant did not file his federal and state income tax returns for multiple tax \nyears when they were due. AG \u00b6 19(f) is applicable. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nConditions that could mitigate the financial considerations security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 20. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control; and \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax \nauthority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \nApplicant foolishly but honestly believed he did not have to file income tax returns \nif he would receive a refund. The IRS and his state benefitted from his ignorance as he \nforfeited almost $18,000 in federal refunds for tax years 2006 and 2009 through 2015 \nand at least $10,000 in refunds from his state during the same period. All of the returns \nsince 2006 have now been filed, with the returns for the last three years filed on time. \nReturns from 2005 and earlier no longer have any security significance. \nApplicant accepted responsibility for his tax failures and poor judgment. He now \nutilizes a tax professional, which he finds easier and saves him thousands in refunds. \nThe above mitigating condition is applicable, but that does not end the discussion.\nApplicant\u2019s failure to file his tax returns when required raises questions about his\njudgment and willingness to abide by rules and regulations. I found Applicant to be\nhonest and truthful, but lax about his legal requirement to file his tax returns in a timely \nmanner. I am convinced that he has learned a valuable and costly lesson, and that all \nfuture returns will be filed on time. Security concerns about Applicant\u2019s finances are \nmitigated. \n \n \n \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \nThe security concern for personal conduct is set out in AG \u00b6 15, as follows: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process. \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. The following disqualifying conditions are potentially applicable: \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or \nsimilar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment \nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance \neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities. \n(c) credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is \nnot sufficient for an adverse determination under any other single \nguideline, but which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-\nperson \nassessment \nof \nquestionable \njudgment, \nuntrustworthiness, \nunreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and \nregulations, or other characteristics indicating that the individual may not \nproperly safeguard classified or sensitive information; and \n(e) personal conduct, or concealment of information about one\u2019s conduct, \nthat creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress by a \nforeign intelligence entity or other individual or group. Such conduct \nincludes: \n(1) engaging in activities which, if known, could affect the person\u2019s \npersonal, professional, or community standing. \nApplicant did not intentionally provide false information about his taxes on his \n2018 SF 86. AG \u00b6 16(a) is not applicable. SOR \u00b6 2.a is concluded for Applicant. \nApplicant\u2019s failure to file his federal and state income tax returns when due is \ncross-alleged under Guideline E. That conduct reflects questionable judgment and an \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations. It also created vulnerability to \nexploitation, manipulation, and duress. AG \u00b6\u00b6 16(c) and 16(e) are applicable. \nAG \u00b6 17 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. The following \nare potentially applicable: \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, \nunreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely \nto recur; and \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate \nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe discussion above under financial considerations applies equally here. I find \nthe conduct is unlikely to recur, and it no longer casts doubt on Applicant\u2019s reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment. AG \u00b6\u00b6 17(c), 17(d), and17(e) are applicable. \nPersonal Conduct security concerns are mitigated. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an\napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guidelines E and F in my whole-person analysis. I also considered \nApplicant\u2019s honorable military service and favorable character evidence. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude Applicant \nmitigated the personal conduct and financial considerations security concerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.b: \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 2.a-2.b: \nFor Applicant \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nConclusion \nIt is clearly consistent with the national interest to continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility \nfor a security clearance.

And it \nwasn\u2019t until they thought that I didn\u2019t owe them money that they contacted \nme to tell me to file, at which point I did and they sent me a return, a \nrefund. So that was the nature of that relationship with the IRS as I \nperceived it. (Tr. at 22-23)  \nApplicant credibly testified that he did not realize that he had to file tax returns if \nhe was due refunds. Since he had more than enough withheld from his paychecks to \npay his taxes, he incorrectly believed he was not required to file the returns. He planned \nto file the returns and receive the refunds, but he just never got around to it. (Tr. at 12-\n13, 22-26, 36; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 2, 3) \nApplicant served on active duty in the military in a combat regiment as a first \nlieutenant from 1994 to 1997. During that period, he served in Operation Uphold \nDemocracy in Haiti in about 1994 to 1995. He was also involved in counter-drug \noperations. He was involved in training exercises and a conference. As some point, \nlikely in about 1996, his regiment asked him to assist other service members to file their \ntax returns, which Applicant stated took away from his ability to file his own returns. \nThere is no evidence as to what, if any, training Applicant received in order to help his \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ntroops.

(Tr. at \n21; GE 1) \nIRS tax transcripts indicate that in some years the IRS filed returns for Applicant, \nand in at least one year actually issued a refund based on the IRS-prepared returns. For \ntax year 2002, the IRS showed an inquiry for non-filing of tax return on February 23, \n2004. The IRS prepared a substitute tax return on July 12, 2004, and refunded $600 to \nApplicant on September 3, 2004. (GE 2) \nFor tax year 2003, the IRS showed an inquiry for non-filing of tax return on April \n18, 2004. The IRS prepared a substitute tax return on September 29, 2008.

However, it was already beyond the three-year window to receive a \nrefund. (GE 2) \nThe IRS established that no tax returns was filed for tax years 2004, 2005, and \n2006 and issued notices for all three years on June 2, 2008. (GE 2) \nApplicant submitted a Questionnaire for National Security Positions (SF 86) in \nJanuary 2018.

Applicant filed his \nfederal and state income tax returns for 2017 in January 2019. The federal return was \nreceived by the IRS in January 15, 2019. The IRS issued a refund of $3,024 on March \n1, 2019. (GE 2) \nApplicant was interviewed for his background investigation on January 31, 2019, \nafter the 2017 return had been filed. A signed statement was not taken, but the \ninterview was summarized in a report of investigation. He initially answered that he \nsatisfies all legal requirements. He was asked if he had any questions or concerns, at \nwhich time, he volunteered that he had not filed federal and state tax returns since \n1997, and he was not sure if he was legally required to do so if he did not owe money. \nHe filed the returns for 2005 and 2006 (exact year unknown (actually 2007 and 2008)). \nGE 3) \nApplicant told the investigator that he missed the April 15th deadline each year, \nand he believed the IRS and his state were happy since he always had the maximum \namount deducted from his paycheck; he owned a home; and he would be due a refund \nof at least $3,000 from the IRS and an unsure amount from his state.

So yeah, for that year I once again slipped\u201d (Tr. at 32) \nThe DOD sent Applicant interrogatories. The dates they were sent to Applicant \nand when he received them are not in the record, but it was apparently no later than \nJanuary 2020, because that period is mentioned in Applicant\u2019s response to the \ninterrogatories. (GE 2) \nApplicant used to file his own returns by hand. He finally realized it was easier to \nuse a professional, and he retained the services of a tax professional to prepare the \nreturns. As indicated above, he filed his federal and state income tax returns for 2017 in \nJanuary 2019. He requested IRS wage and income transcripts (W-2 information) for the \nyears that he did not have W-2 forms. He filed the 2009 through 2018 returns in January \nand February 2020. The IRS received his 2006 return in September 2020. He was due \nfederal refunds each year, in amounts ranging from $1,242 to $3,673. Because the IRS \ndoes not pay refunds from returns more three years old, Applicant forfeited almost \n$18,000 in federal refunds for tax years 2006 and 2009 through 2015. He stated that he \nforfeited at least $10,000 in refunds from his state during the same period. The IRS \nwould not provide wage and income transcripts from before 2010, and Applicant no \nlonger had information for tax years before 2006.

He has a \ngood job with a stable income. He completed a financial counseling course. His \nfinances are currently in good shape, and he is aware that neglecting his tax obligations \nin the future could jeopardize his security clearance and his job. He found the process \nof using a tax professional easy, and he is no longer forfeiting thousands of dollars in \nrefunds.

(Tr. at 17-19, 32-35; Applicant\u2019s response to \nSOR; GE 3, 4; AE G) \nApplicant credibly denied intentionally providing false information about his taxes \non his 2018 SF 86. As addressed above, he did not realize that he was required to file \ntax returns if he was due refunds, and he did not owe any taxes. Therefore, he thought \nhe provided the correct answer.

In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nApplicant\u2019s credibility is key to the personal conduct allegations and the financial \nconsiderations allegations. The Appeal Board noted: \nWe concur with the Judge that a key issue in this case is whether or not \nApplicant knew he was required to file the alleged Federal and state \nincome tax returns. In her appeal brief, Department Counsel persuasively \nargues the Judge did not address important aspects of the case.   \nI agree with the Appeal Board that this case hinges on whether Applicant knew \nhe had to file income tax returns as that is the key to the falsification allegation under \nGuideline E as well as his failure to file the returns, which was cross-alleged under both \nGuidelines E and F. Since Applicant\u2019s veracity, or lack thereof, is key to both guidelines, \nI will address why I found Applicant credible under the falsification allegation, and \nincorporate that discussion by reference under the personal conduct and financial \nconsiderations analysis for the failure to file federal and state income tax returns. \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct (Falsification of SF 86) \nThe security concern for personal conduct is set out in AG \u00b6 15, as follows: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process. \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. The following disqualifying condition is potentially applicable to the \nallegation that Applicant intentionally falsified his SF 86: \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or \nsimilar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                          \n \nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance \neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities. \nApplicant denied the falsification allegation, and the mere omission of information \ndoes not prove a falsification. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 17-00709 at 3 (App. Bd. Jun. \n28, 2018). It is the Government\u2019s obligation to prove controverted matters by substantial \nevidence, i.e., \u201csuch relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate \nto support a conclusion in light of all the contrary evidence in the same record.\u201d \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.32.1. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 16-04094 at 2 (App. Bd. Apr. 20, \n2018). An administrative judge must consider the record evidence as a whole to \ndetermine an applicant\u2019s state of mind at the time of the omission. See ISCR Case No. \n03-09483 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 17, 2004). An applicant\u2019s experience and level of \neducation are relevant to determining whether a failure to disclose relevant information \non a security clearance application was deliberate. ISCR Case No. 08-05637 (App. Bd. \nSep. 9, 2010). \nAs indicated in the Findings of Fact and in my original decision, Applicant did not \nintentionally provide false information about his taxes on his 2018 SF 86, and the \nGovernment did not meet their burden of proof that he did. AG \u00b6 16(a) is not applicable. \nSOR \u00b6 2.a is concluded for Applicant. \nThe Appeal Board directed me to address certain \u201cidentified matters in \ndetermining whether Applicant knew of his obligation to file the alleged tax returns and \nwhether Applicant mitigated the foolishness and poor judgment he demonstrated in \nfailing to file those returns as required.\u201d \nI will address some of the factors that went into my credibility determination, \nsome of which individually are relatively minor, but when considered as a whole led to \nmy conclusion. Judging credibility is a complicated process, with both the explainable \nand the inexplicable. The Honorable John L. Kane, Senior District Judge, Federal \nDistrict of Colorado, described it as follows: \nA few brave souls have attempted to parse the elements of credibility, but \nthis essential function is left largely to the mysteries of intuition. Although \ndemeanor evidence can mislead, it is considered a reliable basis for \nfinding credibility. Does the witness hesitate or stammer or show fear in \nanswering questions? Reliance on demeanor vests wide discretion in the \nfact-finder. As Judge Jerome Frank, no slouch when it came to pushing \nthe judicial envelope, observed, the methods of evaluating oral testimony \n\u201cdo not lend themselves to formulations in terms of rules and are thus, \ninescapably, \u2018unruly.\u2019\u201d1 \nThere is a reason why judges and juries are usually given deference in their \ncredibility determinations.

Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1. The party challenging a judge\u2019s \ncredibility determination has a heavy burden on appeal. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 02-\n12199 at 3 (App. Bd. Aug. 8, 2005). That deference of course is not absolute, which is \nwhat resulted in the remand decision. For instance, a credibility determination may be \nset aside or reversed if it is unreasonable, contradicts other findings, is based on an \ninadequate reason, is patently without basis in the record, is inherently improbable or \ndiscredited by undisputed fact, is contradicted by other evidence, or is so internally \ninconsistent or implausible that a reasonable fact finder would not credit it.

Bessemer City, 470 U.S. \n564 at 575 (1985).  \nWhen the record contains a basis to question an applicant\u2019s credibility (e.g., prior \ninconsistent statements, prior admissions, or contrary record evidence), the judge \nshould address that aspect of the record explicitly, explaining why he or she finds an \napplicant\u2019s version of events to be worthy of belief. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 14-05476 \nat 5 (App. Bd. Mar. 25, 2016). \nAssessing credibility is not being a human lie-detector. It is an examination of all \nof the evidence in the case, and assessing whether that evidence is consistent with and \nsupport\u2019s the witness\u2019s testimony, or is inconsistent and contradicts the testimony. The \nobjective part of a credibility determination can be explained. The subjective part can be \ninexplicable, particularly to someone who did not observe the witness\u2019s testimony. \nThat is why it is somewhat surprising that Applicant\u2019s veracity became the crux of \nDepartment Counsel\u2019s appeal, when Department Counsel observed Applicant\u2019s \ntestimony, and his veracity was barely mentioned in her closing argument. Department \nCounsel did not argue that the concerns were with Applicant\u2019s veracity; she argued that \nthe concerns were primarily related to Applicant\u2019s failure to file his tax returns and to \ncomprehend the significance of his tax issues: \u201cThere\u2019s a failure here, the Government\u2019s \nposition is there\u2019s a failure here for the Applicant to realize the gravity of his actions.\u201d \n(Tr. at 45-46) Department Counsel specifically argued: \nHe lives in his, for lack of a better way to put it, he lives in his own bubble. \nI know I don\u2019t owe the Government money. I know that I have withheld \nmore than enough. Heck, I\u2019m giving them extra money at the end of the \nyear, I\u2019m not applying for my refund, I should be golden. (Tr. at 46) \nThat argument is subject to interpretation, but when taken with the rest of her argument, \nit appears that the Government did not dispute Applicant\u2019s version of events, just \nquestioned whether, even if true, Applicant should have a security clearance. I do not \nbelieve the following argument by Department Counsel is subject to interpretation: \nSo, I mean, you\u2019ve been doing this long enough, Judge, we submit to your \ndiscretion as to how much you\u2019d like to credit Applicant\u2019s testimony in that \nregard and the decision you want to make there.

It appears what she really meant was that she left it \nto my discretion, unless I came down on the side of believing Applicant. Nonetheless, \nDepartment Counsel\u2019s argument is not evidence; and the Government, an \nadministrative judge, and the Appeal Board are not limited by Department Counsel\u2019s \nargument. My findings were and are based on the evidence, not Department Counsel\u2019s \narguments. \nApplicant clearly never took any actions, or failed to take any actions, designed \nto avoid paying taxes. Quite the opposite. He never owed any additional taxes, and he \nforfeited about $28,000 by not filing the returns within the required three-year window to \nreceive a refund. \nApplicant served in the U.S. military or the military reserve from 1984 to 1997. He \nserved about eight years on active duty. He was an officer when he was honorably \ndischarged. He has held a security clearance for decades, apparently without incident. I \nalso considered his favorable character evidence, and that he was warned as are all \nwitnesses that it is a criminal offense to knowingly and willfully make any materially \nfalse, fictitious, or fraudulent statement or representation in any matter within the \nexecutive branch of the Government of the United States. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001. Security \nclearances are within the jurisdiction of the executive branch of the Government of the \nUnited States.2 A violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001 is a serious offense as it may be \npunished by imprisonment for up to five years and a $10,000 fine. \nDoes that mean that individuals who served honorably as military officers, with \nfavorable character evidence, would not knowingly commit a federal crime and lie \nduring these proceedings? Of course not, as we see that frequently. However, those \nindividuals with good records are less likely to lie. We at DOHA are frequently involved \nwith allegations of lying and criminal conduct, and we can become jaded in that regard, \nbecause we only see those individuals whose backgrounds have raised security \nconcerns. We do not see those who go through the process without issues. \nAs an imperfect example because of the differing standards of proof, in a court-\nmartial, if there is character evidence presented, the members (jury) are instructed by \nthe military judge something to the effect: \nEvidence of the accused\u2019s character for [pertinent character trait] may be \nsufficient to cause a reasonable doubt as to his or her guilt. On the other \nhand, evidence of the accused\u2019s good character for [pertinent character \ntrait] and (good military record) may be outweighed by other evidence \ntending to show the accused's guilt. See Electronic Benchbook available \nat: https://www.jagcnet.army.mil/EBB/. \nI considered the nature of Applicant\u2019s statement that he believed that he did not \nhave to file returns if he was due a refund. It is relatively easy to discard that statement \n2 See Department of the Navy v.

The \nIRS reported in March 2022 that it had an estimated $1.5 billion in refunds for an \nestimated 1.5 million taxpayers who did not file tax returns in tax year 2018. The three-\nyear window to collect those refunds closed in April 2022.3 It is impossible to know how \nmany of that 1.5 million shared Applicant\u2019s beliefs that he was not required to file a tax \nreturn because he was due a refund. It is equally impossible to know how many \nadditional people shared Applicant\u2019s beliefs, but they filed their returns in order to get \ntheir refund. I also note that nowhere in the IRS article does it state that taxpayers who \nmeet the income threshold are required to file returns even if they are due refunds. That \ninformation is available elsewhere on the IRS website. \nThe following matters identified by the Appeal Board are addressed individually: \nIdentified Matter 1 \nAt some point, likely in about 1996, Applicant\u2019s regiment asked him to assist \nother service members to file their tax returns. One might think that means he has tax \nexpertise, but there is no evidence as to what, if any, training Applicant received in order \nto help his troops. Junior officers are assigned many duties, particularly when deployed, \nsome of which they do without training, and they are ill prepared for the task. They do \nthe best they can because the troops they are assisting know even less. \u201cIn the land of \nthe blind, the one-eyed man is king.\u201d (Desiderius Eramus) I did not find that detracted \nsignificantly from Applicant\u2019s credibility. \nIdentified Matter 2 \nApplicant testified that at least some of his delayed filings were due to\nhaving \u201cjust missed the day, and the IRS didn\u2019t follow up . . . .\u201d Id. at 22.\nWhen asked about his filings of 2018 tax returns following his clearance\ninterview, he replied, \u201cI, once again, was intending to . . . do it by hand and\nthe due date slipped because I wasn\u2019t using a tax service.\u201d Id. at 32. \n \n \n \n \nI saw nothing in the above that is inconsistent with Applicant\u2019s testimony that he \nnever went into a tax year thinking that he would not file tax returns. He just missed the \nday and then let things slide because he did not owe any money. The aspect of this \nidentified matter relating to the delay in filing the 2018 returns after the interview will be \naddressed under the analysis related to Applicant\u2019s judgment under personal conduct \nand financial considerations. \nIdentified Matter 3 \nApplicant\u2019s background interview reflects the following exchange: \u201c\u2018[D]o \nyou satisfy all legal financial obligations?\u2019 \u2018Yes.\u2019 . . . \u201c[Applicant] was asked \nif he had any questions or concerns.

The chronology is important for this matter. Applicant submitted \nthe SF 86 in January 2018. The IRS issued a notice for tax year 2017 on December 17, \n2018, after the SF 86 was submitted. Applicant received the notice in December 2018 \nbecause he discussed it with the investigator on January 31, 2019. He volunteered the \ninformation because he was not completely sure that he was correct. It is possible that \nthe notice may have shaken his beliefs, but it does not detract from whether he believed \nit when he submitted the SF 86. \nIdentified Matter 4 \nApplicant\u2019s tax transcripts appear to indicate the IRS sent him notices over \nthe years regarding his tax filing deficiencies. They also indicated tax \nreturns were secured after the IRS prepared substitute returns. \nI considered the actions by the IRS, including their notices. The IRS\u2019s actions \nshould have made the lightbulb go off in Applicant\u2019s head, but they may have actually \ncontributed to Applicant\u2019s misinformation. In general, except for forfeiture of older \nrefunds, the IRS does not punish individuals who do not file returns, but would be due \nrefunds if they did. There are penalties and interest imposed on those who file late and \nowe taxes, but no penalties for those who just file late. It is not difficult to understand \nwhy many (including Applicant) believe the IRS is happy when taxpayers who are due a \nrefund do not file returns. It is actually a revenue saver for the IRS, as shown in \nApplicant\u2019s case, where he forfeited almost $18,000, and by the estimated $1.5 billion in \nrefunds for an estimated 1.5 million taxpayers who did not file their 2018 tax returns. \nAdditionally, Applicant might have received mixed signals from the IRS. Tax \ntranscripts indicate that in some years the IRS filed returns for him and in at least one \nyear, the IRS actually issued a refund based on the IRS-prepared returns. For tax year \n2002, the IRS showed an inquiry for non-filing of tax return on February 23, 2004. The \nIRS prepared a substitute tax return on July 12, 2004, and refunded $600 to Applicant \non September 3, 2004. \nThe Appeal Board also identified that \u201cApplicant testified that he filed [2007\u2019s] tax \nreturn on time to qualify for a Federal Government program in which stimulus checks \nwere issued.\u201d Applicant readily admitted that he felt the stimulus payments were being \nissued for a political motive. He filed to receive the stimulus payment, and he then did \nnot vote for the candidates or party that supported the stimulus program. That is not \ninconsistent with his overall testimony. \nIn addition to all of the above reasons, I found nothing that detracted significantly \nfrom Applicant\u2019s testimony. I just found him credible. \n11 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nIdentified Matters 5 and 6 \nThe credibility aspect of Identified Matter 5 was addressed above under Identified \nMatter 3. Identified Matter 6 is about Applicant\u2019s \u201cpoor judgment\u201d under personal \nconduct. The judgment aspects of Identified Matters 5 and 6 will be discussed below. \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations (failure to file), as cross-alleged under \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \nApplicant\u2019s failure to file federal and state income tax returns was alleged under \nGuideline F and cross-alleged under Guideline E. They will be discussed together. The \nsecurity concern for financial considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18:       \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds.  \nGuideline E notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under AG \n\u00b6 16. Guideline F notes conditions that could raise security concerns under AG \u00b6 19.\nThe following are potentially applicable in this case:   \n \n16(c) credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is not \nsufficient for an adverse determination under any other single guideline, but \nwhich, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-person assessment of \nquestionable \njudgment, \nuntrustworthiness, \nunreliability, \nlack \nof \ncandor, \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations, or other characteristics \nindicating that the individual may not properly safeguard classified or sensitive \ninformation;  \n16(e) personal conduct, or concealment of information about one\u2019s conduct, that \ncreates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress by a foreign \nintelligence entity or other individual or group. Such conduct includes: \n(1) engaging in activities which, if known, could affect the person\u2019s \npersonal, professional, or community standing; and \n19(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local \nincome tax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax as required. \n12 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \nApplicant did not file his federal and state income tax returns for multiple tax \nyears when they were due. AG \u00b6 19(f) is applicable. That conduct reflects questionable \njudgment and an unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations. It also created \nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, and duress. AG \u00b6\u00b6 16(c) and 16(e) are also \napplicable. \nConditions that could mitigate the personal conduct and financial considerations \nsecurity concerns are provided under AG \u00b6\u00b6 17 and 20. The following are potentially \napplicable: \n17(c) the offense is so minor, o\n r so much time has passed, or the behavior \nis so infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \n17(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained \ncounseling to change the behavior or taken other positive steps to \nalleviate the stressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to \nuntrustworthy, unreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such \nbehavior is unlikely to recur;  \n17(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate \nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress; \n20(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; and \n20(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax \nauthority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \nApplicant foolishly but honestly believed he did not have to file income tax returns \nif he would receive a refund. The IRS and his state benefitted from his ignorance as he \nforfeited almost $18,000 in federal refunds for tax years 2006 and 2009 through 2015 \nand at least $10,000 in refunds from his state during the same period. All of the returns \nsince 2006 have now been filed, with the returns for the last three years filed on time. \nReturns from 2005 and earlier no longer have any security significance. \nApplicant accepted responsibility for his tax failures and poor judgment. He now \nutilizes a tax professional, which he finds easier and saves him thousands in refunds. \nAG \u00b6 20(g) is applicable, but that does not end the discussion. Applicant\u2019s failure to file \nhis tax returns when required raises questions about his judgment and willingness to \nabide by rules and regulations. I found Applicant to be honest and truthful, but lax about \nhis legal requirement to file his tax returns in a timely manner. I am convinced that he \nhas learned a valuable and costly lesson, and that all future returns will be filed on time. \n13 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe Appeal Board correctly noted that I described Applicant\u2019s belief that he did \nnot have to file income tax returns if he would receive a refund as honest, but \u201cfoolish,\u201d \nand that he exhibited \u201cpoor judgment.\u201d The Appeal Board indicated that in my Guideline \nE analysis, I \u201cdid not explain why Applicant\u2019s late filings, which may have been \nprompted, in part, by the chance of losing a clearance, were sufficient to mitigate the \nnoted poor judgment security concerns.\u201d The Appeal Board directed me to address the \nmatter under Guideline E, but it applies to both Guidelines, so I will address them \ntogether. \nI note that previous versions of the Adjudicative Guidelines did not have the \nequivalent of AG \u00b6 20(g). By including AG \u00b6 20(g) in the current Adjudicative Guidelines, \nI believe the Security Executive Agent directed me to give it full consideration. As \ndiscussed above, AG \u00b6 20(g) is clearly applicable. The applicability of a mitigating \ncondition does not end the discussion. In ISCR Case No. 17-01807 at 3-4 (App. Bd. \nMar. 7, 2018), the Appeal Board held: \n[t]he mere filing of delinquent tax returns or the existence of a payment \narrangement with an appropriate tax authority does not compel a Judge to \nissue a favorable decision. As with the application of any mitigating \ncondition, the Judge must examine the record evidence and decide \nwhether the favorable evidence outweighs the unfavorable evidence, or \nvice versa. The timing of corrective action is an appropriate factor for the \nJudge to consider in the application of [pertinent mitigating conditions]. \nBefore a finding that the security concerns are not mitigated, there should be a \ndiscussion as to why the concerns are not mitigated despite the applicability of one or \nmore mitigating conditions. The Appeal Board has provided guidance on that matter in \nfinancial cases. An applicant who begins to resolve his or her financial problems, \nincluding filing tax returns, only after being placed on notice that his or her clearance is \nin jeopardy may lack the judgment and self-discipline to follow rules and regulations \nover time or when there is no immediate threat to his or her own interests. See, e.g., \nISCR Case No. 16-03187 at 4 (App. Bd. Aug. 1, 2018). \nThis case can be distinguished from many others because Applicant was not \naware that he had to file the returns if he was due refunds, which means that he did not \nintentionally shirk his tax-filing responsibilities. I believe he was placed on notice that he \nwas required to file the returns and that his clearance was in jeopardy during the \ninterview for his background investigation on January 31, 2019. \nApplicant\u2019s returns, including for tax year 2018, were not filed until early in 2020, \nalmost a year after the interview. However, older returns require more work. W-2 forms, \nor the equivalent information in the form of an IRS wage and income transcript, have to \nbe obtained, and then the returns have to be completed and filed. The returns for 2018 \nwere filed about nine months after the standard due date of April 15, 2019, and about \nthree months after the automatic extension had Applicant applied for one. \n14 \n\n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe delay is less than ideal, but it is acceptable in light of Applicant\u2019s \nresponsibility in filing his 2019, 2020, and 2021 returns on time. To establish a \nmeaningful track record of reform, an applicant is required to demonstrate that he has \nestablished a plan to resolve his financial problems and taken significant actions to \nimplement that plan. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 19-01624 at 34 (App. Bd. Aug. 29, \n2022). I find he has done so. \nAs indicated throughout this decision, Applicant was never driven by money. If \nApplicant was truthful, which I believe he was, his failure to file his tax returns was not \ndone out of malice, ill intent, or with intention to avoid paying taxes. It was foolish \nbecause he forfeited about $28,000 in refunds. He exercised poor judgment in not being \naware of his legal obligations, and then in taking time to rectify those issues. But he did \nrectify the problems, and his three years\u2019 worth of timely returns indicate that he has \nlearned his lesson. I find the conduct is unlikely to recur, and it no longer casts doubt on \nApplicant\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment. AG \u00b6\u00b6 17(c), 17(d), 17(e), and \n20(a) are applicable. Personal conduct and financial considerations security concerns \nare mitigated. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guidelines E and F in my whole-person analysis. I also considered \nApplicant\u2019s honorable military service and favorable character evidence. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude Applicant \nmitigated the personal conduct and financial considerations security concerns. \n15 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.b: \n \n \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 2.a-2.b: \n \n \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIt is clearly consistent with the national interest to continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility \nfor a security clearance.

Hayes, Esq., Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro se \n11/16/2022 \nDecision \nNOEL, Nichole L., Administrative Judge: \nApplicant contests the Department of Defense\u2019s (DOD) intent to deny his \neligibility for a security clearance to work in the defense industry. Applicant\u2019s financial \nproblems are the result of chronic underemployment, not irresponsible or reckless \nfinancial behavior. Furthermore, there is no evidence in the record to suggest that \nApplicant has an unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations. Clearance is granted. \nStatement of the Case \nOn February 5, 2020, the DOD issued an SOR detailing security concerns under \nthe financial considerations guideline. This action was taken under Executive Order \n(EO) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry, signed by President \nEisenhower on February 20, 1960, as amended; as well as DOD Directive 5220.6, \nDefense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program, dated January 2, \n1992, as amended (Directive), and the Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility \nfor Access to Classified Information, implemented on June 8, 2017. \nDOD adjudicators were unable to find that it was clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to continue Applicant\u2019s security clearance and recommended that the \ncase be submitted to a Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) administrative \njudge for a determination whether to grant his security clearance.

He completed a security clearance application, his first, \nin October 2018. Applicant\u2019s background investigation revealed that he has delinquent \nstudent loan debt. The SOR alleges that he owes $35,887 on five delinquent student \nloans. He admits the allegations. (Tr. 17-18; GE 1) \nApplicant attended college between August 2008 and December 2013, \ngraduating with a degree in visual media design. He financed his education with student \nloans, borrowing $22,000. After graduation, he completed an unpaid internship. He did \nnot secure a paying job until August 2014, when he began working for a small graphic \ndesign company. He left the job after six months and was unemployed for two months \nbefore finding a part-time retail position. He started a full-time position as a graphic \ndesigner with another company in September 2015. He left the position a month later, \nciting a mutual agreement between himself and the company. Because he did not own \nhis designs, he could not develop a professional portfolio, which was necessary to show \nprospective graphic design employers. In effort to develop more transferrable skills, \nApplicant enrolled in a local community college to take classes in architectural drawing. \nHe took classes between July 2016 and December 2017, which he paid for out of \npocket. (Tr. 18-19, 23-24, 42-43) \nBetween November 2015 and 2018, he worked a series of low-paying, entry-\nlevel retail jobs. He could not afford to make payments on his student loan accounts. He \nreceived the offer of employment from his current employer in November 2017. \nBecause he thought he would begin work immediately, he moved from his apartment in \nhis hometown in State 1 to the location of the new job in a higher cost of living market in \nState 2. However, he did not receive a start date for another three months. In addition to \nthe higher cost of living, Applicant has experienced a series of financial setbacks. In \nAugust 2018, he experienced a medical crisis and passed out at work. He required \nsurgery and the treatment resulted in $560 medical bills, which he paid between April \nand August 2019. Because the incident happened at work, his employer required him to \ngo on short-term disability until the facility\u2019s medical office deemed him able to return to \nwork. Applicant was out of work for approximately one month. (Tr. 20-22, 30-32, 46-48; \nGE 2; AE L-M) \nIn November 2018, his car became inoperable months before he satisfied the \nloan on the vehicle. Once the loan was satisfied, he planned to apply the monthly \npayment toward his student loans. Instead, he purchased a new car, which was totaled \nin an accident shortly after he purchased it. In late 2018, Applicant\u2019s father began to \nexperience significant health issues and became unable to work sometime in 2019. \nApplicant began making bi-monthly trips to State 1 to help his mother care for his father. \nAlthough Applicant does not provide his parents financial support on a regular basis, he \nincurs expenses related to his trips to State 1 and assists his parents with food and \nother expenses, as needed.

According to the credit reports in the record, the \nbalance has increased from $22,000 to over $52,000. Between 2018 and 2019, he \nmade $1,000 in payments on the loans alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.d. He also paid $180 on an \nunalleged student loan account. Currently, his student loan accounts are in good \nstanding because of the Covid-19 student loan payment pause issued by President \nBiden in March 2020. Applicant testified that he does not earn enough money to pay his \nliving expenses and his student loans. He is aware that his income makes him available \nfor loan forbearance once the pause is lifted. However, because of the accruing interest, \nhe is hesitant to apply for the relief even if doing so returns his student loans to good \nstanding. (Tr. 26-27, 53-54; AE A-I, K) \nApplicant is a salaried employee. His net income is just over $31,000 annually. \nHis recurring expenses are for housing, transportation, and food. He cancelled his \ninternet service to reduce his monthly expenses. After paying his recurring bills each \nmonth, he has approximately $300 in disposable income. The credit reports in the \nrecord show an otherwise favorable credit history. Applicant does not have any credit \ncards. His only consumer debt is for his car loan. The account is in good standing. (Tr. \n22; GE 3-4) \nAlthough Applicant does not have a government-issued security clearance, his \nemployer has granted him access to proprietary information related to his job duties. \nApplicant reported that he has handled that responsibility without incident. (Tr. 38) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nAn individual\u2019s finances become a concern when their failure to meet their \nfinancial obligations is a possible indication of poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about \nan individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified or sensitive \ninformation. An individual who is financially overextended is at a greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. (AG \u00b6 18) \nThe record establishes the Government\u2019s prima facie case. Applicant has five \ndelinquent student loans, which he cannot afford to pay. The following financial \nconsiderations disqualifying conditions apply: \nAG \u00b6 19(a) inability to satisfy debts; and  \nAG \u00b6 19(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nThe record contains some evidence in mitigation. Since graduating from college \nin 2013, Applicant has not been in a financial position to make consistent payments on \nhis student loans. This is the result of chronic underemployment between 2013 and \n2018.

Those payments range between \n$128 in January 2020 and $117 in May 2021. Applicant provided documents supporting \nthat assertion. His payments began before the SOR was issued in May 2020. (Item 3 and \nResponse.) \nApplicant denied SOR \u00b6\u00b61.h. through 1.k., which total $1,321. He stated that he \ndisputed those debts, thereby causing them to be removed from his credit reports. (Item \n3 and Response.) The Government\u2019s most recent credit reports in the record (December \n2019 and September 2021) support that assertion; those four SOR debts do not appear \non those reports. (Items 7 and 8.) Applicant did not provide any documents of his own to \nsupport his assertion. The SOR debts became delinquent between June 2016 and June \n2019. (Items 6 and 7.) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a public trust position, the \nadministrative judge must consider the disqualifying and mitigating conditions in the AG. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of \nhuman behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nadjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, \nimpartial and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a \nconscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d \nThe administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the \nperson, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to [sensitive] \ninformation will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable trustworthiness decision. \nA person who seeks access to sensitive information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nsensitive information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard sensitive information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation of potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of sensitive information. \nDiscussion \nGuideline F \u2013 Financial \nUnder Guideline F for financial considerations, the suitability of an applicant may \nbe questioned or put into doubt when that applicant has a history of excessive \nindebtedness or financial problems or difficulties. AG \u00b6\u00b6 18, 19, and 20 (setting forth the \nconcern and the disqualifying and mitigating conditions). \nThe overall concern is: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial obligations may \nindicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and \nregulations, all of which can raise questions about an individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and ability to protect classified or sensitive information. AG \u00b6 18. \nThe concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified or sensitive information to obtain money or something else of \nvalue. It encompasses concerns about a person\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other \nimportant qualities. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified or sensitive \ninformation. \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nIn analyzing the facts of this case, I considered the following disqualifying and \nmitigating conditions or factors: \nPotentially Disqualifying Factors \nAG \u00b6 19(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \nAG \u00b6 19(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; \nPotentially Mitigating Factors \nAG \u00b6 20(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not \ncast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment;  \nAG \u00b6 20(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \nAG \u00b6 20(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to \nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \nAG \u00b6 20(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy \nof the past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \nThe evidence supports a conclusion that Applicant has had problematic financial \nconditions sufficient to raise a trustworthiness concern under Guideline F. He appears to \nhave been unable to satisfy his debts, and he has a history of not meeting his financial \nobligations. Therefore, AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a), and (c) apply. The next inquiry is whether any of the \nmitigating conditions apply. \nThe debts that raised trustworthiness concerns were delinquent when the SOR \nwas issued in May 2020 and remained in arrears when the FORM was filed. Those debts \nwere neither infrequent, nor did they occur long ago. Therefore, AG \u00b6 20(a) does not \napply. \nApplicant cites his period of unemployment following his discharge from the Army \nas a factor in causing him to fall behind in payments on his debts. In turn, Applicant claims \nthat his discharge from the Army was caused by financial and transportation problems \nthat were beyond his control. The Government\u2019s evidence does not rebut those claims.  \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n     \n   \n \n \n \n \n         \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe inquiry under AG \u00b6 20(b), however, does not end there. Applicant does not offer proof \nof how he responded responsibly to the adverse circumstances he confronted about his \ndebts. Accordingly, AG \u00b6 20(b) does not apply. \nIn his Response, Applicant submitted documents that he has been on a monthly \nplan to defray his student loan debts. His documents show that on one plan started in \n2018, he was \u201cnever late.\u201d Another plan shows that he has been current since January \n2020. Both plans apparently were started before the SOR was issued in May 2020. AG \u00b6 \n20(d) applies, and I find for Applicant on SOR \u00b6\u00b61.a. through 1.g. \nSOR \u00b6\u00b61.h. through 1.k. remain to be addressed. Applicant denied those four \ndebts, which he has disputed. They total $1,321, which is less than 5% of the total SOR \ndebts. Since Applicant mitigated 95% of the SOR debts, I conclude that the remaining \nfour debts do not present a national security concern. Accordingly, I find in favor of \nApplicant on SOR \u00b6\u00b61.h. through 1.k. \nConclusion \nThe record does not create doubt about Applicant\u2019s trustworthiness, good \njudgment, and ability to protect sensitive information. In reaching this conclusion, I \nweighed the evidence as a whole and considered if the favorable evidence outweighed \nthe unfavorable evidence or vice versa. I also considered the \u201cwhole-person\u201d concept. AG \n\u00b6\u00b6 2(a) and (d)(1)-(9) (explaining the \u201cwhole-person\u201d concept and factors). \nAccordingly, I conclude that Applicant met his ultimate burden of persuasion to \nshow that it is clearly consistent with the interest of national security to grant him eligibility \nfor access to sensitive information. \nFormal Findings \nThe formal findings on the SOR allegations are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.k:  \nFor Applicant \nIn light of the record as a whole, it is clearly consistent with the interests of national \nsecurity to grant Applicant eligibility for access to sensitive information. \nPhilip J.

Additional findings of fact follow. \nBackground Information \nApplicant is a 45-year-old subject matter expert level 4 employed by a defense \ncontractor since February 2018. He seeks to retain his secret security clearance, which \nis a requirement of his continued employment. (GE 1; Tr. 11-13) \nApplicant graduated from high school in May 1994. He was awarded an \nassociate of arts degree in general studies in February 2009. (GE 1; Tr. 13-15) \nApplicant was married from 2005 to 2018, and that marriage ended by divorce. He does \nnot have any children. (GE 1; Tr. 15-16) \nApplicant served in the U.S. Marine Corps from January 1996 to January 2000, \nand was honorably discharged as a sergeant (pay grade E-5). He reentered the Marine \nCorps in May 2001 and served continuously until he retired as a staff sergeant (pay \ngrade E-6) in August 2017. His military occupational specialty at the time of his \nretirement was 0848 (field artillery operations chief). (GE 1; AE E; Tr. 16-17) Applicant \nhas been awarded a Veterans Affairs (VA) 100% total and permanent disability rating in \npart for combat-related injuries. (Tr. 17-18; AE J) \nFinancial Considerations \nApplicant\u2019s responsibility for the 10 delinquent SOR debts, totaling approximately \n$73,828, is established by his SOR Answer; his May 2018, September 2019, and July \n2021 credit reports; his February 21, 2019 Office of Personnel Management Personal \nSubject Interview (OPM PSI); and his hearing testimony. (SOR Answer; Tr. 19-43; GE 2 \n\u2013 5) \nApplicant\u2019s financial problems originated when he was married to his former \nspouse. He described his marriage as contentious, especially around the time he and \nhis wife separated in 2016. (Tr. 20, 38) Applicant\u2019s last assignment in the Marine Corps \nrequired him to move from the East Coast to the West Coast, however, his wife initially \nchose not to accompany him. She was not employed and they fell into debt trying to \nmaintain two households. (Tr. 19-21, 23) Applicant contacted a bankruptcy attorney in \n2016 before he retired from the Marine Corps, but could not afford the filing fee.

That same attorney gave him two options, pay off his charged off debts, \nwhich would not improve his credit or wait seven years until his debts fell off his credit \nreport. (Tr. 22-24) \nI advised Applicant that ignoring his legally incurred debts by letting them fall off \nhis credit report was not an acceptable means of debt resolution in the security \nclearance venue. (Tr. 24-25) Post-hearing, Applicant provided documentation that he \nhad paid or resolved five of his ten SOR debts, and that he enrolled the remaining five \ndebts in a debt consolidation program (DCP), on October 6, 2021, discussed below. (AE \nC) \nThe following is a summary of Applicant\u2019s SOR debts and their status: \nSOR \u00b6 1.a - $21,671 charged-off consolidation loan.

This debt is enrolled in Applicant\u2019s \nDCP, and is being repaid. DEBT BEING RESOLVED. (Tr. 37-38; AE C, AE D(1)). \nAs the above summary reflects, Applicant has paid or resolved five of his ten \nSOR debts, and enrolled the other five debts in a DCP. As part of his DCP, Applicant \nparticipated in financial counseling. The DCP that Applicant submitted is measured and \nthorough. Beginning on October 15, 2021, Applicant began paying $866 each month to \nthe DCP by direct debit. Applicant will continue to pay that amount until the enrolled \ndebts are satisfied or otherwise resolved. The DCP also prepared a monthly budget for \nApplicant that reflects that his total monthly income is $8,300, which includes $5,200 \ntake home pay and $3,100 in VA disability benefits. After all deductions, he has a net \nmonthly remainder of $240. (AE C) \nApplicant rents a single family home on a military base for $2,539 per month. \nThat fee includes all utilities except for cable. His budget further reflects that he \nmaintains a modest lifestyle and lives within his means. Applicant is current on all his \nother debts. (Tr. 39-40; AE C) \nCharacter Evidence \nApplicant submitted several documents to include his DD 214s, summaries of \naction and citations for his personal awards from his Marine Corps service, evaluations \ndocumenting his performance as a Marine from 2008 to 2016, civilian performance \nreviews documenting his performance as a Government contractor from 2018 to 2020, \nand six reference letters from former commanders and supervisors. The collective \nmessage these documents convey is that Applicant has honorably served his country \nfor 20 years and five months as an active duty Marine, and continued his service as a \nGovernment contractor for the past four years. All of the individuals who submitted \nreference letters recommend and support continuation of Applicant\u2019s clearance. (Tr. 23; \nAE E \u2013 AE H) \nWhile in the Marine Corps, he made five deployments, three to Iraq; and two \nMarine Expeditionary Unit deployments, one to the Gulf of Aden and the Persian Gulf, \nand the other to Bosnia. (Tr. 18) As noted, Applicant has been awarded a 100% VA \ntotal and permanent disability rating in part for combat-related injuries.

In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious \nscrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance \ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \n5 \n\n \n \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAnalysis \nFinancial Considerations \nAG \u00b6 18 articulates the security concern for financial problems: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nAG \u00b6 19 provides two disqualifying conditions that could raise a security concern \nand may be disqualifying in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nThe evidence of record establishes concerns under AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and 19(c). \nFurther review is necessary. \nAG \u00b6 20 lists five potential mitigating conditions: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control; \n6 \n\n \n \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \nThe Appeal Board concisely explained Applicant\u2019s responsibility for proving the \napplicability of mitigating conditions as follows:  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nOnce a concern arises regarding an Applicant\u2019s security clearance \neligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance \nof a security clearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th \nCir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991). After the Government \npresents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the \napplicant to rebut or mitigate those concerns. See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. The \nstandard applicable in security clearance decisions is that articulated in \nEgan, supra. \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for \naccess to classified information will be resolved in favor of the national \nsecurity.\u201d Directive, Enclosure 2 \u00b6 2(b).  \nISCR Case No. 10-04641 at 4 (App. Bd. Sep. 24, 2013). \nApplicant\u2019s conduct does not warrant full application of AG \u00b6 20(a) because there \nis more than one delinquent debt and his financial problems are not isolated. His debt \nremains a \u201ccontinuing course of conduct\u201d under the Appeal Board\u2019s jurisprudence. See \nISCR Case No. 07-11814 at 3 (App. Bd. Aug. 29, 2008) (citing ISCR Case No. 01-\n03695 (App. Bd. Oct. 16, 2002)).  \nAG \u00b6 20(b), 20(c), and 20(d) are fully applicable. Applicant underwent a \ncontentious and costly divorce towards the end of his Marine Corps career. The \nfinancial fallout from that divorce continues to this day. Applicant has paid or resolved \nfive of his ten SOR debts, and enrolled the other five debts in a DCP. As part of his \nDCP, Applicant participated in financial counseling. Applicant\u2019s DCP is measured and \nthorough. Beginning on October 15, 2021, Applicant began paying $866 each month to \nthe DCP by direct debit. Applicant will continue to pay that amount until the enrolled \ndebts are satisfied or otherwise resolved. AG \u00b6 20(e) is not applicable. \nApplicant would have begun the process of addressing his delinquent debts \nsooner had he not received legal advice to wait until his debts fell off his credit report. \nOnce Applicant was informed that this approach was not an acceptable means of debt \nresolution in the security clearance arena, he immediately took action to right his ship. \nFive of his debts are paid or resolved and the remaining five debts are enrolled in a \nDCP. Applicant has made significant or sufficient progress towards regaining financial \nresponsibility in a deliberate and measured way. With this in mind, the adjudicative \n7 \n\n \n \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nguidelines do not require that an applicant be debt-free. The Appeal Board has \nestablished the following basic guidance for adjudications in cases such as this: \n. . . an applicant is not required, as a matter of law, to establish that he has \npaid off each and every debt listed in the SOR. All that is required is that \nan applicant demonstrate that he has established a plan to resolve his \nfinancial problems and taken significant actions to implement that plan. \nThe Judge can reasonably consider the entirety of an applicant\u2019s financial \nsituation and his actions in evaluating the extent to which that applicant\u2019s \nplan for the reduction of his outstanding indebtedness is credible and \nrealistic. There is no requirement that a plan provide for payments on all \noutstanding debts simultaneously. Rather, a reasonable plan (and \nconcomitant conduct) may provide for the payments of such debts one at \na time. \nISCR Case No. 07-06482 at 3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008) (internal citations and quotation \nmarks omitted). When considering the entirety of Applicant\u2019s financial situation, I view \nApplicant\u2019s corrective action to be responsible and reasonable. Given his resources, he \nhas initiated a pragmatic approach to the repayment of the five remaining SOR debts \nand is making a good-faith effort to resolve them. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \nThe ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security clearance \nmust be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the \nguidelines and the whole-person concept. AG \u00b6 2(c). The discussion in the Analysis \nsection under Guideline F is incorporated in this whole-person section. However, further \ncomments are warranted. \nBoth the mitigating conditions under Guideline F and the whole-person analysis \nsupport a favorable decision. Applicant\u2019s 20 years as an active duty Marine and four \nyears as defense contractor while successfully holding a clearance weigh in his favor. \nHe is current on his day-to-day expenses, lives within his means, and his SOR debts \n8 \n\n \n \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nhave been resolved or are being resolved.

Egan, \n484 U.S. 518 (1988), my careful consideration of the whole-person factors and \nsupporting evidence, my application of the pertinent factors under the adjudicative \nprocess, and my interpretation of my responsibilities under the adjudicative guidelines. \nFormal Findings \nThe formal findings on the allegations set forth in the SOR are as follows: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \nFOR APPLICANT \nFor Applicant \n  Subparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.j: \nConclusion \nIn light of the record as a whole, it is clearly consistent with the national interest \nto continue Applicant\u2019s security clearance.
