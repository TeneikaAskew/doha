Goldstein, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Martha D. Henderson, Esquire\nJuly 3, 2008\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nMOGUL, Martin H., Administrative Judge:\nApplicant submitted his Security Clearance Application (SF 86), on June 2, 2006.\nOn February 7, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a\nStatement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns under Guideline B for\nApplicant. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified\nInformation within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense\nDirective 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program\n(January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG)\npromulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective within the\nDepartment of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n \nApplicant replied to the SOR in writing (RSOR) on March 21, 2008, and\nrequested a hearing before an Administrative Judge. I received the case assignment on\nApril 25, 2008. DOHA issued a notice of hearing on May 13, 2008, and I convened the\nhearing as scheduled on June 2, 2008. The Government offered Exhibits 1 through 5,\nwhich were received without objection. Applicant submitted Exhibits A through D, which\nwere entered without objection. Applicant testified, and five other witnesses testified on\nhis behalf. DOHA received the transcript of the hearing (Tr) on June 12, 2008. Based\n\n2\nupon a review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility for access to\nclassified information is granted.\nRequest for Administrative Notice\nDepartment Counsel submitted a formal request that I take administrative notice\nof certain facts relating to the Federal Republic of Nigeria (Nigeria).  The request and\nthe attached documents were admitted into evidence as Exhibit 5. The facts\nadministratively noticed are set out in the Findings of Fact, below. \nFindings of Fact\nIn his RSOR, Applicant admitted all of the factual allegations in the SOR. The\nadmitted allegations are incorporated herein as findings of fact. \nAfter a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, including\nApplicant's RSOR, the admitted documents, and the testimony of Applicant and the\nadditional witnesses, and upon due consideration of that evidence, I make the additional\nfindings of fact: \nApplicant is 39 years old and was born in Nigeria in 1968. He moved to the\nUnited States in 1992 to pursue a higher education, and he became a naturalized\nUnited States citizen in July 2003.  Applicant received a Ph.D. and a Master\u2019s of\nScience degree from United States universities, and an additional Master\u2019s of Science\ndegree and Bachelor\u2019s degree from a university in Nigeria. \nApplicant is employed by a defense contractor, and he seeks a DoD security\nclearance in connection with his employment in the defense sector.\nApplicant was married to his first wife from 1996 to 2004, and he has been\nmarried to his current wife since 2004. Applicant has three children. His two children\nwith his current wife were born in Nigeria, but they are United States citizens, and they\nnow have only United States passports. Applicant also has a stepson that he has not\nseen since 1992. \nThe following concerns allegations as cited in the Statement of Reasons:\n1.a.  Applicant\u2019s wife is a citizen of Nigeria, and she resides in the United States.\nShe moved to the United States in January 2006. Applicant\u2019s wife testified that in a few\nmonths, when she is eligible, she is planning to apply for United States citizenship. She\nwill give up her Nigerian citizenship once she becomes an American. While she is\ncurrently not employed, she was a medical doctor in Nigeria, and she has been\npreparing for and taking examinations so that she may practice medicine in the U.S.\n1.b. Applicant\u2019s mother, son, mother-in-law, half brother, four sisters, and one\nbrother are citizens and residents of Nigeria. Applicant\u2019s mother is 72 years old. He last\nspoke to her in December 2007, and before that in January 2007.  He can only reach\n\n3\nher by calling his sister, who then will transport her to where a phone is located. His\nmother owns palm fruit trees, and she hires people to harvest them, which is how she\nreceives her income. Applicant speaks to one of his sisters only as a means to contact\nhis mother. He has had no contact with any of his other sisters since he was last in\nNigeria.  Applicant has not spoken to his brother who lives in Nigeria in many years. The\nmother of Applicant\u2019s wife, is a Nigerian citizen and resident, but neither Applicant nor\nhis wife has a close relationship with Applicant\u2019s mother-in-law. None of Applicant\nrelatives in Nigeria works for or is associated with the Nigerian government. \nApplicant also has two younger brothers who reside in Italy. Finally, Applicant\nhas a stepson. At one time, Applicant  represented himself to be this boy\u2019s biological\nfather, for the child\u2019s benefit, although he never was. Applicant has had no contact with\nthis boy since 1992.\n1.c.  Applicant traveled to Nigeria on the following dates: December 1998,\nDecember 1999, September 2003, September 2004, and December 2004. \nApplicant testified as to the reasons that he traveled to Nigeria. In December\n1998, he attended the funeral of the mother of a friend, whom he had known in the\nUnited States. In December 1999, he visited his own mother in Nigeria, who was ill and\nhad recently had a heart attack. His other trips were also to visit his mother who\nremained in failing health, and also his last visit was to do the necessary paperwork so\nthat he could marry his current wife.  Applicant has no current plans to visit Nigeria in\nthe future, but hopes to be able to return when his mother dies, for her funeral. \nNeither Applicant nor his wife owns any property in Nigeria. They do own a home\nin the United States, and he estimated his net worth in the United States at\napproximately $750,000.\nApplicant testified persuasively that he has no emotional ties to Nigeria, but he\nhas very strong feelings of love and loyalty for the United States. After he became a\nU.S. citizen, he returned his Nigerian passport and revoked his Nigerian citizenship. \nAs stated above, Applicant had several individuals testify on his behalf. The first\nwitness is the chief scientist for another company, who was the former direct supervisor\nof Applicant. Witness A described Applicant as \u201can extremely reliable person . . . I would\ntrust him with anything.\u201d (Tr at 111). \nThe second character witness who testified on behalf on Applicant, is a manager\nat the same employer as Applicant, and has known him for more than two years.\nWitness B testified that Applicant is \u201cConscientious and Dedicated.\u201d He further agreed\nthat Applicant\u2019s work was credible and reliable.\nThe third witness is the section manager of Applicant\u2019s current employer, and he\nsupervises Applicant\u2019s work. Witness C testified that Applicant is \u201cdiligent and\nhardworking. As meticulous as he can be. Persevering.\u201d  He also agreed that Applicant\nis trustworthy and reliable.\n\n4\nThe fourth and final witness for Applicant is a director for his current employer\nand his immediate supervisor.  Witness D described Applicant as \u201cdiligent and serious\nabout his work. A good employee. Dependable.\u201d (Tr at 142). He also indicated that\nApplicant is trustworthy. \nStatus of Nigeria \nI take administrative notice of the following facts regarding Nigeria. Nigeria is a\nfederal republic in western Africa composed of 36 states and a capital territory. Since\nNigeria gained independence from Britain in 1960, it has experienced periods of political\ninstability and turmoil, in addition to economic crisis. While Nigerian political life has had\nperiods of conflict in both ethnic and geographic areas, and the military has ruled for\napproximately 28 years since its independence, it has been under civilian rule since\n1999. \nNigeria is Africa\u2019s most populous country with more than 250 ethnic groups, and\na majority of its population suffers from extreme poverty. Areas of Nigeria are marked\nby serious instability, and religious, political and ethnic factions have been involved in\narmed conflict. \nFinally, the human rights record of the Nigerian government is poor, as it\ncontinues to commit serious human rights abuses, including politically motivated and\nextrajudicial killings by security forces, torture arbitrary arrests, and judicial corruption. \nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6\n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as\nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available,\nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in\nmaking a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\n\n5\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of\nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \nAnalysis\nGuideline B, Foreign Influence\nAG \u00b6 6 expresses the security concern regarding foreign influence:\nForeign contacts and interests may be a security concern if the individual\nhas divided loyalties or foreign financial interests, may be manipulated or\ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a\nway that is not in U.S. interests, or is vulnerable to pressure or coercion by\nany foreign interest. Adjudication under this Guideline can and should\nconsider the identity of the foreign country in which the foreign contact or\nfinancial interest is located, including, but not limited to, such\nconsiderations as whether the foreign country is known to target United\nStates citizens to obtain protected information and/or is associated with a\nrisk of terrorism.\nAG \u00b6 7 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be\ndisqualifying (DC). Those that could be applicable in this case include the following: (a)\ncontact with a foreign family member, business or professional associate, friend, or\nother person who is a citizen of or resident in a foreign country if that contact creates a\nheightened risk of foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion;\nand (d) sharing living quarters with a person or persons, regardless of citizenship status,\nif that relationship creates a heightened risk of foreign inducement, manipulation,\npressure, or coercion. Applicant\u2019s relatives, including his mother, sisters, brother,\n\n6\nmother-in-law and son, who are citizens and residents of Nigeria, make DC (a) a\nconcern to the Government. His wife, who is still a citizen of Nigeria, and whose mother\nis both a citizen and resident of Nigeria, make DC (d) applicable.  \nAG \u00b6 8 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns (MC):\n(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in which these\npersons are located, or the positions or activities of those persons in that country are\nsuch that it is unlikely the individual will be placed in a position of having to choose\nbetween the interests of a foreign individual, group, organization, or government and the\ninterests of the U.S.; (b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual's\nsense of loyalty or obligation to the foreign person, group, government, or country is so\nminimal, or the individual has such deep and longstanding relationships and loyalties in\nthe U.S., that the individual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of\nthe U.S. interest. \nI find that MC (b) is applicable to this Applicant and controlling for the following\nreasons: Applicant, who is 39 years old, has lived in the United States for 16 years and\nbeen a U.S. citizen for 5 years. While he is married to a Nigerian citizen, she is planning\nto apply for U.S. citizenship within the next few months when she will be eligible to\napply.  She is also studying and testing so that she may be able to practice her\nprofession of being a medical doctor. Applicant and his wife\u2019s two children are being\nraised solely as U.S. citizens and residents.  \nApplicant has received his primary education of a Masters of Science degree and\na Ph.D. degree in the United States, which is the only country in which he has been\nemployed. He has no assets in Nigeria, and estimates his assets in the United States\nworth approximately $750,000. \nOf all his relatives in Nigeria, the only person with whom he has a close\nrelationship is his mother, who is 72 years old and in failing health. While his testimony\nis not controlling, Applicant did testify credibly that if he received a threat that his mother\nwould be injured or killed if he did not comply with requests to provided classified\ninformation, he would report any such threats to his employer\u2019s security officer rather\nthan cooperate with the threatening parties. Applicant did testify that he was totally\ncommitted to the Unites States and had no feelings for Nigeria.  Finally, the witnesses\nwho testified on Applicant\u2019s behalf were credible and persuasive that Applicant is an\nindividual of high moral character and someone who can be trusted. \nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness\nof the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include\nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\n\n7\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which participation\nis voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent\nbehavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure,\ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d\nUnder AG \u00b6 2 (c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security\nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration\nof the guidelines and the whole person concept.      \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Based on all of the reasons cited\nabove as to why MC (b) applies, I also find that the record evidence leaves me without\nquestions or doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance\nunder the whole person concept. For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant mitigated\nthe security concerns. \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline B:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nFor Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is\nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is granted.\n                                              \nMartin H. Mogul\nAdministrative Judge\n",

Nagel, Esquire, Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro Se \n \n \n \n \n______________ \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \n \nCREAN, Thomas M., Administrative Judge: \n \nApplicant submitted his Security Clearance Application (SF 86), on December \n17, 2004. (Gov X 4)  On August 9, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals \n(DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security concerns under \nGuidelines H (Drug Involvement). (Gov X 1)  The action was taken under Executive \nOrder 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), \nas amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel \nSecurity Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the \nrevised Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, \n2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September \n1, 2006.   \n \n \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on October 22, 2007.  He admitted the \nallegations under Guideline H, except he did not respond to an allegation pertaining to a \nstatutory prohibition against granting or renewing a security clearance for an unlawful \ndrug user.  He elected to have the matter decided on the written record in lieu of a \nhearing. (Gov X 3) \nMarch 6, 2008\n\n \n2 \n \n \nDepartment Counsel submitted the Government\u2019s written case on November 26, \n2007.  Applicant received a complete file of relevant material (FORM) on January 10, \n2008, and was provided the opportunity to file objections and submit material to refute, \nextenuate, or mitigate the disqualifying conditions within 30 days.  He has not \nresponded with additional information.  The case was assigned to me on March 4, 2008.  \nBased upon a review of the case file and the pleadings, eligibility for access to classified \ninformation is denied. \n \nProcedural Issues \n \n \nSOR allegation 1.e alleges a violation of 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 986 because Appellant is a \npresent user and purchaser of marijuana, a controlled substance.  This section of the \nUnited States Code was repealed in the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal \nYear 2008 on January 28, 2008.  It was replaced by adding section 3002 to 50 U.S.C. \u00a7 \n435b.  This new provision is the same as 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 986 and states a person that is an \nunlawful user of a controlled substance or an addict cannot be granted a security \nclearance by any federal agency.  Since the prohibitions are the same, there is no \nprejudice to the Applicant and he has received adequate notice of the prohibition.  The \nprohibition will be discussed under 50 U.S.C. 435b and not 10 U.S.C. 986. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant admitted the factual allegations under Guideline H.  I thoroughly and \ncarefully reviewed the case file and the pleadings.

He is not married.  \nApplicant listed on his security clearance application that he used marijuana from March \n2001 until December 2004 when he completed the application.  He also answered \n\u201cYES\u201d to the question whether in the last seven years he had been involved in the illegal \npurchase, manufacture, trafficking, production, transfer, shipping, receiving or sale of \nany drug for his own intended profit or that of another.(Gov X 4) \n \n \nApplicant admitted on April 12, 2007, in an affidavit to security investigators that \nhe used marijuana once a week with friends from March 2002 until the date of the \nsecurity interview and affidavit.

The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline H, Drug Involvement \n \nThe use of an illegal drug or misuse of a prescription drug can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because it may impair \n\n \n4 \n \njudgment and because it raises questions about a person\u2019s ability or willingness to \ncomply with laws, rules, and regulations.  Drugs are mood and behavior altering \nsubstances, and include those listed on the Controlled Substances Act of 1970.  \nMarijuana is listed as a drug in the Controlled Substance Act of 1970.  Drug abuse is \nthe illegal use of a drug or the use of a legal drug in a manner that deviates from \napproved medical direction. (AG \u00b6 24)  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s admits to using and purchasing marijuana from March 2002 until he \nspoke to security investigators in April 2007.  He also stated in April 2007 that he would \ncontinue to use marijuana at least weekly.  His drug use raises Drug Involvement \nDisqualifying Conditions AG \u00b6 25(a) (any drug use), and AG \u00b6 25(c) (illegal drug \npossession, including cultivation, processing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or \ndistribution).   \n \n \nI have considered the Drug Involvement Mitigating Conditions and find none \napply.  Applicant\u2019s last admitted use was days before his most recent security interview \nin April 2007 and his statement of intent to continue to use marijuana makes his use \nrecent and frequent.  AG \u00b6 26(a) (the behavior happened so long ago, was so \ninfrequent, or happened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment) does not apply.  Applicant stated he intends to continue his present rate of \nmarijuana use in the future.  This clearly shows his intent to use illegal drugs in the \nfuture and is not a demonstrated intent to stop using marijuana.  AG \u00b6 26(b) (a \ndemonstrated intent not to abuse drugs in the future, such as; (1) disassociation from \ndrug-using associates and contacts; (2) changing or avoiding the environment where \ndrugs were used: (3) an appropriate period of abstinence: (4) a signed statement of \nintent with automatic revocation of clearance for any violation) does not apply.  \nApplicant demonstrated that he intends to abuse drugs in the future.  Appellant \nestablished that he is a drug user with no intent to stop using drugs.  Guideline H is \ndecided against Applicant.  His statement that he now uses and intends to continue to \nuse marijuana is sufficient information for a finding that Applicant is at present an \nunlawful drug user in violation of section 3002 of 50 USC \u00a7 435b. \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness \nof the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include \nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which participation \nis voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent \nbehavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, \ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \n\n \n5 \n \nclearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case.  I considered that Applicant has \nused drugs for at least six years while working for a federal contractor in violation of the \nlaw.  He intends to continue to use drugs in the future.  Overall, the record evidence \nleaves me with no questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s present and future abuse of \ndrugs and his lack of good judgment, reliability, trustworthiness, and willingness to \nfollow rules and regulations.  He has not established that he is suitable for a security \nclearance.  For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant has not mitigated the security \nconcerns arising from his abuse of marijuana.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline H:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.b:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.c:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.d:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.e:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n \n_________________ \nTHOMAS M. CREAN \nAdministrative Judge \n",

Goldstein Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro Se\nSeptember 17, 2008\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nLOKEY ANDERSON, Darlene D., Administrative Judge:\n           Applicant submitted his Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations (e-QIP), on\nNovember 1, 2005.  On January 3, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals\n(DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns under\nGuidelines G, E and B for Applicant. The action was taken under Executive Order\n10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as\namended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel\nSecurity Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the\nrevised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29,\n2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September\n1, 2006. \n \nApplicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on February 16, 2008.  He answered\nthe SOR in writing on February 26, 2008, and requested a hearing before an\nAdministrative Judge.  The case was assigned to this Administrative Judge on April 29,\n2008.  A notice of hearing was issued on May 2, 2008, and the matter was scheduled\nfor hearing on May 28, 2008.  The Government presented eight exhibits, referred to as\nGovernment Exhibits 1 through 8, which were received without objection. The Applicant\npresented two exhibits, referred to as Applicant\u2019s Exhibits A and B, which were received\nwithout objection. The Applicant also testified on his own behalf.  DOHA received the\ntranscript of the hearing (Tr.) on June 5, 2008.  Based upon a review of the case file,\n\n2\npleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility for access to classified information is\ndenied.\nFindings of Fact\nThe Applicant is 47 years old and married.  He has a high school diploma and\nvarious Naval educational courses.  He is employed by a defense contractor as an\nElectronic Satellite Controller, and is applying for a security clearance in connection with\nhis employment.\nThe Government opposes the Applicant's request for a security clearance, on the\nbasis of allegations set forth in the Statement of Reasons (SOR).  The following findings\nof fact are entered as to each paragraph and guideline in the SOR:\nParagraph 1 (Guideline G - Alcohol Consumption).  The Government alleges that the\nApplicant is ineligible for clearance because he abuses intoxicants.\nThe Applicant began consuming alcohol in junior high or high school at the age of\nseventeen.   He usually drank beer, at the most a six pack at social gatherings with\nfriends on the weekends.  Following high school, in February 1989, the Applicant joined\nthe Navy and continued to use alcohol at times to excess and to the point of\nintoxication.  In 1985, he married his first wife, they had one child, and were divorced in\n1989.  \nIn April 1991, while serving in the United States Navy, the Applicant was arrested\nand charged with Driving Under the Influence of Alcohol.  He explained that he went to\nshoot pool one evening and consumed alcohol.  On his way home he was pulled over\nby the police.  He was fined $1,400.00 and placed on probation for three years.  He was\nevaluated by the Navy for his excessive alcohol consumption and was referred to the\nNDSAP.  An administrative action in June 1991, indicated that the Applicant was\ndiagnosed with \u201calcohol abuse\u201d.  The Applicant married his second wife in 1995, and\nthey have two children.  \nIn 1999, the Applicant was having real difficulties with his second wife.  She did\nnot like his drinking and he discovered that she was having an extra-marital affair.  In\nAugust 2003, they separated and she took their two children and moved in with another\nman.  The Applicant\u2019s drinking increased to the point where he was consuming about a\nsix pack of beer every day or so.  (Tr. p. 34).       \nIn an effort in part, to save the marriage, the Applicant self-referred himself for\nalcohol treatment from October 2003 through November 2003.  He was treated for\n\u201cAlcohol Dependence\u201d at a Navy hospital.  Medical records show that the Applicant had\nexperienced black outs and had elevated liver enzymes.  (Government Exhibit 6, p. 3).\nThe Applicant was prescribed medication to help him abstain from alcohol.  (Tr. p. 42).\nHe explained that during detoxification he experienced withdrawal symptoms including\ncold sweats, shaking, chills, fever, headaches and the inability to eat.  (Tr. pp. 42- 43).\nWhen he was discharged from the hospital he was diagnosed with \u201cAlcohol\nDependence\u201d, early remission.  He completed the requirements of the program and\n\n3\ncontinued attending Alcoholic Anonymous meetings through New Years, (for about a\nmonth following his discharge) and was able to remain completely sober during this\nperiod.  A month later, he resumed his alcohol consumption, but at a much lower level.\n(Tr. p. 40).  The Applicant and his second wife later divorced.   \n           \nIn March 2005, the Applicant was arrested for (1) Driving Under the Influence, (2)\nUnsafe Lane Change, and (3) Possession of Drug Paraphernalia.  The Applicant had\nbeen consuming alcohol at a pool tournament and was pulled over by the police after\nleaving the bar.  It was determined that the location in which the Applicant was pulled\nover is notorious for DUI arrests, since it is so close to the bar and that the police had\nno probable cause to pull the Applicant over at the time.  The case was subsequently\ndismissed.  (See Government Exhibit 7).\nThe Applicant stated that he continues to consume alcohol.  Just two days before\nthe hearing he consumed two beers.  (Tr. p. 37).  He usually consumes alcohol at\nhome.  He no longer drinks and drives, and becomes intoxicated only about once a\nmonth.  (Tr. p. 45).   \nParagraph 2 (Guideline E - Personal Conduct).  The Government alleges that the\nApplicant is ineligible for clearance because he intentionally falsified material aspects of\nhis personal background during the clearance screening process.\nAs a now retired navy enlisted man, the Applicant held a security clearance\nduring his military career.  He became familiar with the security clearance application\nand has completed at least three of them.  He understands the importance of being\nhonest to the Government in response to questions concerning the security clearance\napplication and background investigation.   \nThe Applicant was interviewed on December 6, 2006, by an investigator for the\nDepartment of Defense.  During that interview he omitted material facts by stating that\nhis arrest for Driving Under the Influence (DUI) in 1991, in Sacramento did not happen.\nAlthough the facts were not entirely accurate, he did not offer the truth.  He deliberately\nfailed to disclose his 1991 arrest and charge for DUI that occurred in San Diego,\nCalifornia.  (See Government Exhibit 3).    \nIn his response to Interrogatories dated October 5, 2007, issued to him by the\nDepartment of Defense, he omitted material facts in that he stated that his arrest in\n1991 for DUI in Sacramento did not happen.  Although the facts were not entirely\naccurate, he did not offer the truth.  He deliberately failed to disclose his 1991 arrest\nand charge for DUl that occurred in San Diego, California.  (See Government Exhibit 3).\n          \nThe Applicant excuse for failing to reveal his 1991 arrest and charge for DUI was\nthat he  forgot about it.  (Tr. p. 26).  He stated that he was shaken up by the fact that the\ninvestigator mention a gun charge to him that he had no knowledge of, and the location\nof a DUI in Sacramento that were inaccurate.  The Applicant contends that he did not\ndeliberately conceal the information from the Government.  However, the evidence\nshows that the Applicant remembered his 1991 DUI on his security clearance\napplication dated July 18, 1995, (See Government Exhibit 2) and, he also mentioned it\nto his doctors during his treatment in 2003 for alcohol dependence as evidenced by his\n\n4\nmedical records.  (See Government Exhibit 6).  It is difficult to believe that he forgot\nabout it during his interview in 2006 and in response to interrogatories in 2007. \nParagraph 3 (Guideline B - Foreign Influence).  The Government alleges in this\nparagraph that the Applicant is ineligible for clearance because he has foreign contacts\nthat could create the potential for foreign influence that could result in the compromise\nof classified information.\nThe Applicant\u2019s third and current wife is a citizen and resident of the Philippines.\nHe met her through the internet in March 2006, and married her in March 2008.  (See\nApplicant\u2019s Exhibit A).  She resides with the Applicant in the United States.  His two\nformer spouses, who he married in 1985, and 1995, respectively, were also Philippines\nnationals.  The Applicant believes that they are both now naturalized United States\ncitizens. Other than about ten telephone calls to his first wife concerning his son, the\nApplicant has had no contact with her since 1988.  His second wife is now residing in\nthe United States.  His former mother-in-law and father-in-law are citizens and residents\nof the Philippines.  The Applicant\u2019s last contact with his in-laws was in 2000. He traveled\nto the Philippines in 1998, two times  in 2000, and at least three times in 2006, to take\nhis children to visit their grandparents.  He has no other foreign contact with the\nPhillippines or any other foreign national whatsoever.  \nPolicies\nEnclosure 2 and Section E.2.2. of the Directive sets forth adjudication policies\ndivided into \"Disqualifying Factors\" and \"Mitigating Factors.\"  The following Disqualifying\nFactors and Mitigating Factors are found to be applicable in this case:\nGuideline G (Alcohol Consumption)\n21.  The Concern.  Excessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of\nquestionable judgment or the failure to control impulses, and can raise questions about\nan individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness.  \nConditions that could raise a security concern:\n22. (a) alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while under the\ninfluence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or other incidents of\nconcern, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed as an alcohol abuser or\nalcohol dependent;\n22. (c) habitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point of impaired\njudgment, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed as an alcohol abuser or\nalcohol dependent;\n22. (d) diagnosis by a duly qualified medical professional (e.g., physician, clinical\npsychologist, or psychiatrist) of alcohol abuse or alcohol dependence.\n\n5\nConditions that could mitigate security concerns:\nNone.\nGuideline E (Personal Conduct)\n15.  The Concern.  Conduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor,\ndishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions\nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified\ninformation.  Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful and candid answers\nduring the security clearance process or any other failure to cooperate with the security\nclearance process.\nConditions that could raise a security concern:\n16.(a)  Deliberate omission, concealment or falsification of relevant facts from\nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar form used\nto conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, award benefits or\nstatus, determine security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary\nresponsibilities.\nConditions that could mitigate security concerns:\nNone.\nGuideline B (Foreign Influence)\n6.  The Concern.  Foreign contacts and interests may be a security concern if the\nindividual has divided loyalties or foreign financial interests, may be manipulated or\ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a way that is not\nin U.S. interests, or is vulnerable to pressure or coercion by any foreign interest.\nAdjudication under this Guideline can and should consider the identity of the foreign\ncountry in which the foreign contact or financial interest is located, including, but not\nlimited to, such considerations as whether the foreign country is known to target United\nStates citizens to obtain protected information and/or is associated with a risk of\nterrorism. \nCondition that could raise a security concern:\n7.  (a) contact with a foreign family member, business or professional associate,\nfriend, or other person who is a citizen of or resident of a foreign country if that contact\ncreates a heightened risk of foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or\ncoercion. \nConditions that could mitigate security concerns:\n8.  (a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in which\nthese persons are located, or the positions or activities of those persons in that country\nare such that it is unlikely the individual will be placed in a position of having to choose\n\n6\nbetween the interests of a foreign individual, group, organization, or government and the\ninterests of the U.S.\nIn addition, as set forth in Enclosure 2 of the Directive at pages 16-17,  in\nevaluating the relevance of an individual\u2019s conduct, the Administrative Judge should\nconsider the following general factors:\na. The nature and seriousness of the conduct and surrounding circumstances\nb. The circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation\n \nc. The frequency and recency of the conduct\nd. The individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct\ne. The voluntariness of participation\nf. The presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavior\nchanges\ng. The motivation for the conduct \nh. The potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation or duress\ni. The likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nThe eligibility criteria established in the DoD Directive identify personal\ncharacteristics and conduct which are reasonably related to the ultimate question,\nposed in Section 2 of Executive Order 10865, of whether it is \u201cclearly consistent with the\nnational interest\u201d to grant an Applicant\u2019s request for access to classified information.\nThe DoD Directive states, \u201cThe adjudicative process is an examination of a\nsufficient period of a person\u2019s life to make an affirmative determination that the person is\nan acceptable security risk.  Eligibility for access to classified information is predicted\nupon the individual meeting these personnel security guidelines.  The adjudicative\nprocess is the careful weighing of a number of variables known as the whole person\nconcept.  Available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable\nand unfavorable should be considered in reaching a determination.\u201d The Administrative\nJudge can draw only those inferences or conclusions that have reasonable and logical\nbasis in the evidence of record.  The Judge cannot draw inferences or conclusions\nbased on evidence which is speculative or conjectural in nature.  Finally, as emphasized\nby President Eisenhower in Executive Order 10865, \u201cAny determination under this order\n. . . shall be a determination in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a\ndetermination as to the loyalty of the Applicant concerned.\u201d\n\n7\nConclusion\nIn the defense industry, the security of classified industrial secrets is entrusted to\ncivilian workers who must be counted upon to safeguard such sensitive information\ntwenty-four hours per day, seven days per week.  The Government is therefore\nappropriately concerned when available information indicates that an Applicant for\nclearance may be involved in alcohol abuse, dishonesty and/or foreign influence that\ndemonstrates poor judgment or unreliability.\nIt is the Government\u2019s responsibility to present substantial evidence to support\nthe finding of a nexus, or rational connection, between the Applicant\u2019s conduct and the\ncontinued holding of a security clearance.  If such a case has been established, the\nburden then shifts to the Applicant to go forward with evidence in rebuttal, explanation\nor mitigation, which is sufficient to overcome or outweigh the Government\u2019s case.  The\nApplicant bears the ultimate burden of persuasion in proving that it is clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant him a security clearance.\nIn this case the Government has met its initial burden of proving that the\nApplicant has engaged in alcohol abuse (Guideline G), dishonesty (Guideline E), and\nforeign influence (Guideline B).  This evidence indicates poor judgment, unreliability and\nuntrustworthiness on the part of the Applicant.  Because of the scope and nature of the\nApplicant's conduct, I conclude there is a nexus or connection with his security\nclearance eligibility.\nConsidering all of the evidence, the Applicant has not introduced persuasive\nevidence in rebuttal, explanation or mitigation that is sufficient to overcome the\nGovernment's case under Guidelines G, E and B of the SOR.\nUnder Alcohol Abuse, Guideline G, Disqualifying Conditions 22(a), \u201calcohol-\nrelated incidents away from work, such as driving while under the influence, fighting,\nchild or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or other incidents of concern, regardless of\nwhether the individual is diagnosed as an alcohol abuser or alcohol dependent\u201d; 22(c)\n\u201chabitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point of impaired judgment, regardless\nof whether the individual is diagnosed as an alcohol abuser or alcohol dependent\u201d and,\n22(d) \u201cdiagnosis by a duly qualified medical professional (e.g., physician, clinical\npsychologist, or psychiatrist) of alcohol abuse or alcohol dependence\u201d apply.  None of\nthe mitigating conditions are applicable.\nThe Applicant\u2019s history of alcohol abuse is extensive.  He has been consuming\nalcohol, at times to the point of intoxication for almost thirty years.  He has been\narrested in 1991, and again in 2005, for DUI.  He has been diagnosed as \u201calcohol\ndependent\u201d and has undergone treatment for his disease. Despite the diagnosis and the\nrecommendation that he completely abstain from the use of alcohol, he continues to\nconsume alcohol.  Based upon his long history of alcohol abuse, its related negative\neffects on the Applicant are such that I am unable to find him sufficiently trustworthy to\n\n8\nsafeguard classified information.  Accordingly Guideline G is found against the\nApplicant. \nUnder Personal Conduct, Guideline E, Disqualifying Condition 16.(a)  Deliberate\nomission, concealment or falsification of relevant facts from any personnel security\nquestionnaire, personal history statement, or similar form used to conduct\ninvestigations, determine employment qualifications, award benefits or status,\ndetermine security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary\nresponsibilities applies.  None of the mitigation conditions are applicable.    \nThe evidence shows that the Applicant intentionally failed to disclose his 1991\narrest and charge for DUI during his interview with the Defense department in 2006, and\nin response to interrogatories in 2007.  Since he revealed his 1991 arrest on his earlier\nsecurity clearance application in 1995, and to his doctors during his alcohol treatment in\n2003, it is not reasonable to believe that he forgot about it.  Even assuming the\ninvestigator confronted the Applicant with wrong information, the Applicant should have\noffered the truth.  There is no reasonable excuse as to why he would not disclose it\nother than to conceal the information and hope that the Government would not notice\nthat he has been arrested on two occasions for DUI arrests, rather than just one.  This\nintentional deception is intolerable.  Accordingly, Guideline E is found against the\nApplicant.   \nUnder Foreign Influence, Guideline B, Disqualifying Condition 7.(a) contact with a\nforeign family member, business or professional associate, friend, or other person who\nis a citizen of or resident of a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of\nforeign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion applies.  However\nMitigating Condition 8.(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the\ncountry in which these persons are located, or the positions or activities of those\npersons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be placed in a\nposition of having to choose between the interests of a foreign individual, group,\norganization, or government and the interests of the U.S. also applies.  \nThe Applicant\u2019s current wife is a citizen of the Philippines, and now lives with the\nApplicant in the United States and is in the process of becoming a United States citizen.\nHis former spouses are now naturalized United States citizens.  His former in-laws\nreside in the Philippines, but he has had no contact with them since 2000.  The\nApplicant\u2019s only travel to the Philippines for the sole purpose of taking his children to\nvisit their grandparents.  He understands his responsibilities in holding a security\nclearance and it is unlikely that he will be influenced by any foreign entity.  Accordingly, I\nfind for the Applicant under this guideline.   \nI have considered all of the evidence presented, however it does not come close\nto mitigating the negative effects of his excessive alcohol abuse and his dishonesty and\nthe effects that it can have on his ability to safeguard classified information.\n\n9\nOn balance, it is concluded that the Applicant has failed to overcome the\nGovernment's case opposing his request for a security clearance.  Accordingly, the\nevidence supports a finding against the Applicant as to the factual and conclusionary\nallegations expressed in Paragraphs 1 and 2 of the SOR.

Duffy, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro Se\n______________\n Decision\n______________\nWESLEY, Roger C., Administrative Judge:\nHistory of Case\nOn September 24, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA),\npursuant to Executive Order 10865 and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6\n(Directive), dated January 2, 1992, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant,\nwhich detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative finding\nunder the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or\ncontinue a security clearance for Applicant, and recommended referral to an\nadministrative judge to determine whether clearance should be granted, continued,\ndenied or revoked.\nApplicant responded to the SOR on October 9, 2007, and requested a hearing.\nThe case was assigned to me on January 17, 2008, and was scheduled for hearing on\nApril 8, 2008.  A hearing was held on April 8, 2008, for the purpose of considering\nwhether it would be clearly consistent with the national interest to grant, continue, deny,\nor revoke Applicant\u2019s security clearance.  At hearing, the Government's case consisted\nof two exhibits; Applicant relied on one witness (himself) and two exhibits.  The transcript\nJune 17, 2008\n\n2\n(R.T.) was received on April 17, 2008.  Based upon a review of the case file, pleadings,\nexhibits, and testimony, eligibility to access classified information is denied.\nBesides its two exhibits, the Government requested administrative notice of six\ndocuments:  Background Note: China, U.S. Department of State (January 2007);\nIntelligence Threat Handbook [Unclassified/For Official Use Only), Interagency OPSEC\nSupport Staff (IOSS) (June 2004); 2007 Report to Congress, U.S.-China Economic and\nSecurity Review Commission (November 2007); Annual Report to Congress from the\nNational Counterintelligence Executive on Economic Collection, 2005-2006 (August\n2006); Country Reports on Human Rights Practices - 2006, China (March 2007);\nConsular Information Sheet on China, U.S. Department of State (March 2007).\nAdministrative or official notice is the appropriate type of notice used for\nadministrative proceedings.  See ISCR Case No. 05-11292 (App. Bd. April 2007); ISCR\nCase No. 02-24875 (App. Bd. October 2006).  Administrative notice is appropriate for\nnoticing facts or government reports that are well known.   See Stein, Administrative\nLaw, Sec. 25.01 (Bender & Co. 2006).  For good cause shown, administrative notice was\ngranted with respect to the above-named background reports addressing the geopolitical\nsituation in China..  Administrative notice was extended to the documents themselves,\nconsistent  with the provisions of Rule 201 of Fed. R. Evi.  This notice did  not foreclose\nApplicant from challenging the accuracy and reliability of the information contained in the\nreports addressing Taiwan\u2019s current state.  \nSUMMARY OF PLEADINGS\nUnder Guideline B, Applicant is alleged to have (a) a spouse who is a citizen of\nthe PRC, (b) met his spouse on a web-site in 2005, \u00a9) a step-son who is a citizen of the\nPRC; (d) a mother -in-law who is a citizen and resident of the PRC; and (d) a father-in-\nlaw who is a citizen and resident of the PRC.\nFor his answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted all of the allegations in the SOR\nwith explanations.  He claimed to have initiated first contact with his spouse through an\ninternet dating service.  He claimed his spouse was already living and working in the\nU.S. at the time while holding an H1B work visa.  He claimed his spouse and step-son\nare lawful U.S. green card holders who he expects to apply for U.S. citizenship.  And he\nclaimed his mother-in-law and step-son (who have since returned to the PRC) were\nvisiting and living with Applicant and his wife when he was interviewed.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nApplicant is a 36-year-old quality assurance engineer for a defense contractor\nwho seeks to retain his security clearance.  The allegations covered in the SOR and\nadmitted by Applicant are adopted as relevant and material findings.  Additional findings\nfollow.\n\n3\nApplicant\u2019s background\nApplicant was born and raised in the U.S., and holds bachelors and masters\ndegrees in engineering from an accredited university.  He has worked for his current\ndefense contractor for over ten years and has held a security clearance since 2003.  \nApplicant\u2019s wife (W), who is 37 years old, came to the U.S. on a work visa in\n2003.  W was born and raised in the PRC and attended a PRC university (R.T., at 40-\n41).  She and her former spouse (who she met at the university they both attended)\nreportedly started a business together in the PRC, which fell apart when they divorced.\nTo the best of Applicant\u2019s knowledge, W never worked for the PRC government, but did\nsome work for a PRC controlled television station for several years before she married\nher ex-spouse (R.T., at 45). \nApplicant met W on an internet dating service in October 2003 (R.T., at 34) and\ndated for about a year before marrying her in October 2005 (R.T., at 34-35).  W left\nbehind a child to live with her parents when she relocated to the U.S. (R.T.,a t 48-49).\nAfter their marriage, Applicant and W brought the step-son over to live with them (R.T.,\nat 36, 47-48).  W has a green card and is pursuing U.S. citizenship (R.T., at 46).\nBecause her green card expires this year, Applicant will need to provide probative\nevidence that W is still with him, and their marriage is legitimate (R.T., at 46).  Once her\ngreen card is renewed, she will need to wait another year to satisfy eligibility\nrequirements for applying for U.S. citizenship as Applicant\u2019s spouse (R.T., at 46).  In the\nmeantime, W has applied for the renewal of her PRC passport in her maiden name, and\nprovided copies of her marriage certificate and green card application (R.T., at 76-79).\nWhile her renewed passport will be issued in her maiden name, it should include a note\nthat confirms her marriage and her husband\u2019\u2018s sir name (R.T., at 75-76).  W expects to\npick up the new passport in April 2008 (R.T., at 79-80).\nApplicant and his wife have no children.  W has no known benefits (like a\npension).  His wife\u2019s parents are citizens and residents of the PRC (see ex. 1; R.T., at\n51-54).  Applicant believes his father-in-law served in the PTC military, but does not have\nany specifics about his military assignments during his service (R.T., at 70, 90-91).\nBefore his recent retirement, his father-in-law worked as a professor in a Chinese school\nsystem (R.T., at 54-55).  Because his father-in-law does not speak English, Applicant\nhas never spoken to him (R.T., at 91).   Applicant believes his father-in-law receives a\npension based on his military service (R.T., at 55-56), but has no details.  \nApplicant\u2019s mother-in-law is a house-wife and does not work outside the home\n(R.T., at 52).  Neither of his in laws have a computer at home.  W does speak to her\nparents weekly (R.T., at 52-53, 56-57).  Besides her parents, W has a sister who is a\ncitizen and resident of the PRC.  W speaks to her sister once a month.  Applicant does\nnot know whether W\u2019s sister is married, or has any children.   He knows she has several\ncousins, but does not know of their whereabouts in the PRC.  Applicant is aware of\ngovernment monitoring in the PRC and does not foreclose the possibility of PRC\n\n4\ngovernment officials monitoring his spouse\u2019s telephone conversations with her family\nmembers.\nW has one sibling, a sister who is a citizen and resident of the PRC (R.T., at 58).\nApplicant has no knowledge of what W\u2019s sister does for a living.  W speaks to her sister\napproximately once a month (R.T., at 58).  W also has uncles and cousins who reside in\nthe PRC.  But Applicant does not have any information on their identities (R.T., at 59).\nApplicant has no reason to believe that any of his family members residing in the\nPRC are at risk to pressure, coercion or influence from PRC intelligence or military\npersonnel (R.T., at 81-82).  While W knows the identity of Applicant\u2019s employer and his\npossession of a security clearance, Applicant does not believe W ever identified his\nemployer or security clearance to anyone residing in the PRC (R.T., at 82-83).  Applicant\nexpressed concerns, though, about his company\u2019s outsourcing its sensitive equipment\nand parts to the PRC (R.T., at 84-87).  \nThe PRC\u2019s country status\nEstablished in 1949, the Peoples Republic of China (PRC) with over 1.3 billion\npeople is the world\u2019s most populous country.  Today it continues to undergo rapid\neconomic and social change.  Political power, however,  remains centralized in the\nChinese Communist Party (CCP) with little indication of any change in the foreseeable\nfuture.  China\u2019s 70.8 million country is authoritarian in structure and ideology and\npossesses increasingly sophisticated military forces which continues to transform itself\nfrom a land-based military power to a smaller, mobile, high tech military that eventually\nwill be capable of mounting limited operations beyond its coastal waters. See\nBackground Note: China, U.S. Department of State, at 14-16 (January 2007). \nWhile not a country acclaimed to be hostile to US persons and interests, the PRC\nmaintains a relationship that is more competitive than cooperative.  The PRC operates a\nlarge and sophisticated intelligence bureau, entitled the Ministry of State Security (MSS).\nSee Intelligence Threat Handbook [Unclassified/For Official Use Only), Interagency\nOPSEC Support Staff (IOSS), at 17 (June 2004).  These operations use clandestine\nagents to collect intelligence on Western consortia investing in the PRC who are\nsuspected of involvement in attempts to democratize the PRC, as well as other pro-\ndemocracy groups thought to be engaging in anti-communist activities.  See Intelligence\nThreat Handbook, supra, at 72.\nBased on past reports to Congress, the PRC is considered one of the most active\ncollectors of U.S. economic and proprietary information.  See Annual Report to Congress\nfrom the National Counterintelligence Executive on Economic Collection, 2005-2006\n(August 2006) The PRC is known especially to use its intelligence services to gather\ninformation about the US and to obtain advanced technologies. See Intelligence Threat\nHandbook, supra, at 17.  The PRC actively monitors international communications\nsatellites from maintained intercept facilities, in addition to collecting information on US\nmilitary operations and exercises.  Examples of PRC economic espionage are cited in\n\n5\nthe Annual Report to Congress from the National Counterintelligence Executive on\nEconomic Collection, 2005-2006, supra, at 10-12.  Most of the examples of illegally\nexported technology to the PRC involved high tech equipment and devices used in\nmissile and aircraft guidance systems, highly sensitive weapons parts, infrared cameras\nand missile microchips. \n As a corollary of its authoritarian roots, the PRC has never been known for a\npositive human rights record among Western nations and international human rights\ngroups.  Part of this can be explained in terms of the PRC\u2019s lack of any cognizable\ntradition for respect for developing democracies and the rule of law. State Department\ncountry reports on the PRC cite the country\u2019s poor human rights record.  Its noted\nhistorical abuses include the suppression of political dissent, arbitrary arrest and\ndetention, forced confessions, torture, and mistreatment of prisoners.  See Country\nReports on Human Rights Practices - 2006, China (March 2007); Consular Information\nSheet on China, at 1-6 U.S. Department of State (March 2007).\nOf growing concern to U.S. security interests are State Department\u2019s latest  reports\nof increased high profile cases in the PRC involving the monitoring, harassment,\ndetention, arrest, and imprisonment of journalists, writers, activists, and defense lawyers\nseeking to exercise their law-protected rights.  See  Country Reports on Human Rights\nPractices - 2006, supra, at 2-9.  The State Department cites a comprehensive, credible\naccounting of all those killed, missing, or detained, reported incidents of deaths in\ncustody, disappearance, torture, and other cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment or\npunishment (see id., at 2-3).  While the PRC officially denies holding any political\nprisoners, Western non-government organizations estimate that approximately 500\npersons remained in prison in 2006 for the repealed crime of counterrevolution, and\nthousands of others were either serving sentences or were being detained for counter-\nrevolutionary offenses (id., at 8).  State Department advisories caution American citizens\nvisiting or residing in China to take the normal safety precautions and remain aware of\ntheir individual surroundings.  See Consular Information Sheet, U.S. Department of State,\nat 2-9 (December 2007).  \nIn its November 2007 Report to Congress, the Security Review Commission\ndescribes the PRC as a country intent on acquiring and exploiting the knowledge\ndeveloped by multiples of collection agents: legally, if possible, and otherwise illegally by\nespionage.  See  2007 Report to Congress, U.S.-China Economic and Security Review\nCommission, at 104-06 (November 2007).  The PRC\u2019s concerted efforts to acquire\nsensitive technology poses a considerable challenge to U.S. counterintelligence\nmeasures.  Recent indictments of Chinese citizens for espionage have served to highlight\nthe PRC\u2019s spying activities in the U.S. (see id.).  Violating  its own 2004 U.S.-China\nagreement, the PRC oft-fails to schedule timely end-use inspection visits of dual-use\nitems licensed for export to the PRC.  Better export controls can be effective only if they\nare multilateral in scope (see id.).  Without effective dual use export controls in place, the\nPRC can be expected to acquire dual use technologies with military potential through the\nU.S. and other source countries. \n\n6\nPolicies\nThe revised Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to\nClassified Information (effective September 2006) list Guidelines to be considered by\nadministrative judges in the decision making process covering DOHA cases.  These\nGuidelines require the administrative judge to consider all of the \"Conditions that could\nraise a security concern and may be disqualifying\u201d (Disqualifying Conditions), if any, and\nall of the \"Mitigating Conditions,\" if any, before deciding whether or not a security\nclearance should be granted, continued or denied.  The Guidelines do not require the\nadministrative judge to assess these factors exclusively in arriving at a decision.  In\naddition to the relevant Adjudicative Guidelines, administrative judges must take into\naccount the pertinent considerations for assessing extenuation and mitigation set forth in\nE.2.2 of the Adjudicative Process of Enclosure 2 of the Directive, which are intended to\nassist the administrative judges in reaching a fair and impartial common sense decision.\nViewing the issues raised and evidence as a whole, the following adjudication\npolicy factors are pertinent herein:\nForeign Influence\nThe Concern: \u201cForeign contacts and interests may be a security concern if the\nindividual has divided  loyalties or foreign financial interests, may be manipulated or\ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a way that is not\nin U.S. interests, or is vulnerable to pressure or coercion by any foreign interest.\nAdjudication under the this Guideline can and should considered the identity of the foreign\ncountry in which the foreign contact or financial interest is located, including, but not\nlimited to, such considerations as whether the foreign country is known to target United\nStates citizens to obtain protected information and/or is associated with a risk of\nterrorism\u201d (see Adjudicative Guidelines, \u00b6 6).\nBurden of Proof\nBy virtue of the precepts framed by the Directive, a decision to grant or continue an\nApplicant's request for security clearance may be made only upon a threshold finding that\nto do so is clearly consistent with the national interest.  Because the Directive requires\nadministrative judges to make a common sense appraisal of the evidence accumulated in\nthe record, the ultimate determination of an applicant's eligibility for a security clearance\ndepends, in large part, on the relevance and materiality of that evidence. As with all\nadversary proceedings, the Judge may draw only those inferences which have a\nreasonable and logical basis from the evidence of record.  Conversely, the Judge cannot\ndraw factual inferences that are grounded on speculation or conjecture.\nThe Government's initial burden is twofold: (1) It must prove any controverted\nfact[s] alleged in the Statement of Reasons, and (2) it must demonstrate that the facts\nproven have a material bearing to the applicant's eligibility to obtain or maintain a security\nclearance.  The required showing of material bearing, however, does not require the\n\n7\nGovernment to affirmatively demonstrate that the applicant has actually mishandled or\nabused classified information before it can deny or revoke a security clearance. Rather,\nconsideration must take account of cognizable risks that an applicant may deliberately or\ninadvertently fail to safeguard classified information.\nOnce the Government meets its initial burden of proof of establishing admitted or\ncontroverted facts, the burden of proof shifts to the applicant for the purpose of\nestablishing his or her security worthiness through evidence of refutation, extenuation or\nmitigation of the Government's case.\nANALYSIS\nApplicant is a U.S. citizen by birth who is married to a citizen of the PRC.  Security\nconcerns focus on  Applicant\u2019s spouse and son from a prior marriage, in addition to her\nimmediate family (i.e., her parents and sister) who are citizens and residents of the PRC,\na country historically competitive with the U.S., and known for its reported record of\neconomic collection activities in the U.S and poor human rights protections.\nDepartment Counsel urges security concerns over risks that W\u2019s parents and her\nson from a another marriage currently residing with them, might be subject to undue\nforeign influence by PRC government authorities to access classified information in\nApplicant\u2019s possession or control.  Because W\u2019s parents and sister reside in the PRC,\nthey present potential heightened security risks covered by disqualifying condition  (DC)\n7(a), \u201ccontact with a foreign family member, business or professional associate, friend, or\nother person who is a citizen of or resident in a foreign country if that contact creates a\nheightened risk of foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion,\u201d\nof the Adjudication Guidelines for foreign influence. The citizenship/residence status of\nthese in-laws and sibling in the PRC pose some potential concerns for Applicant because\nof the risks of undue foreign influence that could compromise sensitive or classified\ninformation under Applicant's possession and/or control. \nBecause W\u2019s father has prior military service (although aged for the most part),\nsome consideration of DC 7(b), \u201cconnection to a foreign person, group, government, or\ncountry that create a potential conflict of interest between the individual\u2019s obligation to\nprotect sensitive information or technology and the individual\u2019s desire to help a foreign\nperson, group, or country by providing that information,\u201d is warranted as well.  Although\nApplicant himself has virtually no contact with his in-laws (in part due to language\nbarriers), W maintains regular contact with them.  Her contacts afford her some potential\nfor accessing PRC officials who might be interested in proprietary, sensitive, or even\nclassified information that Applicant is privy to. It is this potential for information\nexploitation that is security-significant; even though Applicant himself has no identified\naffiliations or contacts with PRC officials currently known to be associated with\nintelligence or military organizations interested in collecting proprietary or sensitive\ninformation in the U.S.\n\n8\nTo be sure, from what is known from the presented evidence, none of W\u2019s\nimmediate family residing in the PRC have any political affiliations with the PRC\u2019s\ngovernment or military, have any history to date of being subjected to any coercion or\ninfluence, or appear to be vulnerable to the same.  With the exception of W\u2019s father\u2019s\ngovernment-funded pension, her parents and sister have no known financial interests\nassociated with the PRC government. \nUpon fully considering Applicant\u2019s explanations about his step son and W\u2019s parents\nand sister, risks of undue foreign influence on Applicant, his step son, and/or W\u2019s parents\nand sister, appear to be substantial and ongoing, and clearly of the magnitude that could\nmake them subject to a heightened security risk of pressure or compromise under\nGuideline B.\nThe PRC, a country reported to have targeted U.S. economic and proprietary\ninterests in the past, is a powerful communist state with an historically poor history of\nrespect for human rights and the rule of law.  Not only is the PRC a reported active\ncollector of economic intelligence in the U.S., but it has been known to use acquired\ninformation to harm U.S. strategic interests.  Still, the PRC remains a pivotal trading\npartner of the U.S. and is a member in good standing with the WTO.\nThe Adjudicative Guidelines governing collateral clearances do not dictate per se\nresults or mandate particular outcomes for applicants with relatives who are\ncitizens/residents of foreign countries in general.  What is considered to be an acceptable\nrisk in one foreign country may not be in another.  While foreign influence cases must by\npractical necessity be weighed on a case-by-case basis, guidelines are available for\nreferencing in the supplied materials and country information about the PRC. \nUnlike the old Adjudicative Guidelines, the new ones do take into account the\ncountry\u2019s demonstrated relations with the U.S. as an important consideration in gauging\nwhether the particular relatives with citizenship and residency elsewhere create a\nheightened security risk. The geopolitical aims and policies of the particular foreign\nregime involved do matter.  As demonstrated, the PRC has long been known to target the\nU.S. and its companies for economic and proprietary information, and remains  a country\nwith a known recent history of hostage taking or disposition for exerting undue influence\nagainst family members to obtain either classified information, or unclassified economic\nand proprietary data. \nAs for security concerns associated with the presence of Applicant's extended\nfamily members in the PRC (a country whose interests have recently been and continue\nto be competitive with the U.S.), the potential heightened risk of a hostage situation or\nundue foreign influence brought in the hopes of eliciting either classified information or\neconomic or proprietary data out of Applicant through his wife\u2019s parents and sister\nresiding in the PRC is considerable for so long as they reside there.  In the past , the\nAppeal Board has shown great reluctance to absolve applicants of security risks who\nhave family members of foreign-born spouses who reside in countries (like the PRC) who\npresent heightened risks.  See ISCR Case No, 01-10128 (App. Bd. Jan. 6, 2005).  Based\n\n9\non his case-specific circumstances and the Appeal Board\u2019s past guidance in dealing with\napplicants with family members who reside in the PRC, MC 8(a), \u201cthe nature of the\nrelationships with foreign persons, the country in which these persons are located, or the\npersons or activities of these persons in that country are such that it is unlikely the\nindividual will be placed in a position of having to choose between the interests of a\nforeign a foreign individual, group, organization, or government and the interests of the\nU.S.\u201d  is not available to Applicant.  Neither W (a resident of the U.S. and citizen of the\nPRC) nor her parents and sister (residents and citizens of the PRC) can be characterized\nas sufficiently insulated from potential pressures and influence from PRC intelligence and\nmilitary officials to warrant application of this mitigating condition.\nOf some benefit to Applicant is MC 8(b), \u201cthere is no conflict of interest, either\nbecause the individual\u2019s sense of loyalty or obligation to the foreign person, group,\ngovernment, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such deep and longstanding\nrelationships and loyalties in the U.S., that the individual can be expected to resolve any\nconflict of interest in favor of the U.S. interest.\u201d Applicant\u2019s demonstrated loyalty,\npatriotism, and professional commitments to the U.S., while considerable, are not enough\nto neutralize all potential conflicts that are implicit in his relationships with his spouse, his\nstep-son and her parents/sister.  MC 8\u00a9), \u201c contact or communication with foreign citizens\nis so casual and infrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create risk for foreign\ninfluence or exploitation,\u201d has some applicability, too, based on Applicant own infrequent\ncontacts with his wife\u2019s family members residing in the PRC.  Application of MC 8\u00a9) is\nnecessarily limited, though, because of W\u2019s frequent exchanges with her parents and\nsister.\nTwo other mitigating conditions have mixed application to Applicant\u2019s situation.\nMC 8(e), \u201cthe individual has promptly complied with existing agency requirements\nregarding the reporting of contacts, requests, or threats from persons, groups, or\norganizations from a foreign country,\u201d has some prospective value based on Applicant\u2019s\nassurances of reporting his travel plans for the PRC.  But there is really no documented\nrecord of Applicant\u2019s prior reporting of his contacts with members of W\u2019s family to warrant\nany more than minimal consideration at this time.  The same holds true with respect to\nMC 8(f), \u201cthe value or routine nature of the foreign business, financial, or property\ninterests is such that they are unlikely to result in a conflict and could not be used\neffectively to influence, manipulate, or pressure the individual.\u201d  The extent of W\u2019s\nfinancial interests and expectancies (e.g., inheritance) in the PRC is for the most part still\nunknown.  \nWhole person assessment is not available either to minimize Applicant\u2019s exposure\nto conflict of interests with his PRC family members.  While Applicant is not aware of any\nrisks of coercion, pressure, or influence that any of his family members might be exposed\nto, he acknowledges language barriers with W\u2019s parents and sister and knows little about\ntheir backgrounds and relationships with former associates.  So, in Applicant\u2019s case, the\npotential risk of coercion, pressure, or influence being brought to bear on his wife and/or\nany of her family members remains considerable. \n\n10\nOverall, any potential security concerns attributable to Applicant's spouse, step-\nson, and her immediate family members residing in the PRC are insufficiently mitigated to\npermit safe predictive judgments about Applicant's ability to withstand risks of undue\ninfluence attributable to his familial relationships in the PRC.  Unfavorable conclusions\nwarrant with respect to the allegations covered by Guideline B.\nIn reaching my recommended decision, I have considered the evidence as a\nwhole, including each of the factors and conditions enumerated in E2.2.2 of the\nAdjudicative Process of Enclosure 2 of the Directive.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nIn reviewing the allegations of the SOR in the context of the findings of fact,\nconclusions, and the factors and conditions listed above, I make the following separate\nformal findings with respect to Applicant's eligibility for a security clearance.\nGUIDELINE B: (FOREIGN INFLUENCE):\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSub-para. 1.a :\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSub-para. 1.b:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSub-para. 1.c:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSub-para. 1.d:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSub-para. 1.e:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\n CONCLUSIONS\nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant's security clearance. \nClearance is denied.\n                                  \nRoger C.

He has been assigned as a project manager in Qatar by his employer since January 2007. In 2004, he was assigned by his employer to work as a project manager in Germany. His other assignments with this employer have all been in the United States. Applicant was born in Lebanon. He attended high school and college in Lebanon and he earned a bachelor of arts degree in mathematics in Lebanon in 1992. In 1993, Applicant moved to France to continue his education. After attending a French college for one semester, Applicant immigrated to the United States to continue his education in January 1994. He was 23 years old when he arrived in the United States. Applicant was awarded a master of science degree in computer science from a United States college in June 1995.

Clearance\nis denied. \nOn March 2, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a\nStatement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant stating it was unable to find it is clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.1\nThe SOR alleges a security concern under Guideline B (foreign influence). Applicant\nsubmitted a response to the SOR that was received by DOHA on April 7, 2009. He\nadmitted the allegation contained in SOR subparagraph 1.a, denied the allegation\ncontained in SOR subparagraph 1.b, and admitted the allegation contained in SOR\nsubparagraph 1.c, with clarification. Applicant requested a hearing.\nDEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE\nDEFENSE OFFICE OF HEARINGS AND APPEALS\nJune 26, 2009\n\n2\nThe case was assigned to me on April 27, 2009. A notice of hearing was issued on\nMay 4, 2009, scheduling the hearing for May 12, 2009. The hearing was conducted as\nscheduled. The government submitted 19 documentary exhibits that were marked as\nGovernment Exhibits (GE) 1-19. GE 1-5 were admitted into the record without objection.\nAdministrative notice was taken of the contents of GE 6-19 without objection. Department\nCounsel submitted a document containing written comments on the contents of GE 6-19\nwhich was marked as Appellate Exhibit (App. Ex.) I and made part of the record without\nobjection. \nApplicant testified but did not submit any documents at the hearing. The record was\nheld open at Applicant\u2019s request to provide him the opportunity to submit letters of\nrecommendation. Three letters were timely received, marked as Applicant\u2019s Exhibits (AE)\n1-3 and admitted into the record without objection. Department Counsel\u2019s forwarding e-\nmails were collectively marked as App. Ex. II and are included in the case file. The\ntranscript was received on May 20, 2009.\nProcedural Matters \nUpon receipt of the file, I was notified by Department Counsel that Applicant would\nbe physically present in the United States for a limited period of time during which the\nhearing could be conducted in person. Upon Applicant\u2019s arrival in the United States, I held\na conference call with Applicant and Department Counsel. During that call, Applicant\nrequested that the hearing be held in person at DOHA\u2019s Virginia headquarters while he was\nin the United States. He also agreed to waive the 15-day notice requirement and to travel\nto the DOHA Virginia headquarters at his own expense. (Tr. 26-29)\nThe SOR in this case indicated Applicant was applying for a public trust position. At\nthe hearing, Department Counsel stated this was in error, that Applicant was applying for\na security clearance, and Department Counsel moved to amend the SOR to conform\ntherewith. The record was held open to provide Department Counsel the opportunity to\nobtain verification that Applicant\u2019s employer was in fact sponsoring him for a security\nclearance as opposed to a public trust position. A written motion to amend the SOR and\nthe employer\u2019s verification that it was sponsoring Applicant for a security clearance were\ntimely received, marked as App. Ex. III and App. Ex. IV and are included in the case file.\nDepartment\u2019s Counsel\u2019s motion to amend the SOR, in the manner requested in his written\nmotion, is hereby granted. \nFollowing the presentation of all evidence, Department Counsel moved to amend\nthe SOR to add the following allegation:\n1.d. Your father-in-law is a citizen and resident of Lebanon.\nThat motion was granted without objection. Applicant admitted this allegation and stated\nhe did not need additional time in which to prepare a response to  the allegation. (Tr. 106-\n114)  \n\n Applicant\u2019s wife is the woman who was alleged to be his girlfriend and a citizen and resident of Lebanon in\n2\nSOR subparagraph 1.b.\n3\nFindings of Fact\nApplicant\u2019s admissions to the allegations in the SOR are incorporated herein. In\naddition, after a thorough review of the pleadings, testimony and exhibits, I make the\nfollowing findings of fact:\nApplicant is a 39-year-old man who has been employed by a defense contractor\nsince 1995. He has been assigned as a project manager in Qatar by his employer since\nJanuary 2007. In 2004, he was assigned by his employer to work as a project manager in\nGermany. His other assignments with this employer have all been in the United States.\nApplicant was born in Lebanon. He attended high school and college in Lebanon\nand he earned a bachelor of arts degree in mathematics in Lebanon in 1992. In 1993,\nApplicant moved to France to continue his education. After attending a French college for\none semester, Applicant immigrated to the United States to continue his education in\nJanuary 1994. He was 23 years old when he arrived in the United States. Applicant was\nawarded a master of science degree in computer science from a United States college in\nJune 1995. He became a naturalized United States citizen on September 11, 2000, and\nhe obtained a United States passport on October 2, 2000.\nApplicant has two brothers, ages 43 and 42. One brother immigrated to the United\nStates from Lebanon in 1992, and the other brother immigrated to the United States from\nLebanon in 1999. Both brothers are naturalized United States citizens and they both reside\nin the same geographic area within the United States. Both brothers are also employed as\nmunicipal police officers.  \nApplicant\u2019s mother and father immigrated to the United States from Lebanon in\n1993. They became naturalized United States citizens in either 1998 or 1999. Applicant\u2019s\nfather was a retired police officer in Lebanon. He is now deceased. Applicant\u2019s mother has\nnot worked outside the home since she immigrated to the United States. She resides in the\nsame geographic area as Applicant\u2019s brothers within the United States. \nApplicant first married in October 1995. That marriage ended in divorce in 2001.\nApplicant was married a second time in May 2004. That marriage ended by an annulment\nin or about July 2005. No children were born of either of these marriages.\nIn 2006, Applicant met his current wife through mutual friends while he was\nvacationing in Lebanon. They have been married since May 2007.  Applicant\u2019s wife is a\n2\nLebanese citizen, but she resides with Applicant in Qatar. One child was born of this\nmarriage in April 2008. The child was born in Lebanon because Applicant and his wife\ndecided to have the child delivered there due to a problematic pregnancy that necessitated\na caesarean section delivery. Applicant\u2019s wife was more comfortable having the surgery\nperformed by a physician with whom she was familiar in Lebanon. The child is a United\nStates citizen by virtue of Applicant\u2019s United States citizenship.  \n\n4\nApplicant has two sisters who are citizens and residents of Lebanon. One sister is\n45 years old, married and has a 12-year-old daughter. She is a lawyer and her husband\nis an engineer. Applicant\u2019s other sister is 36 years old, married and has three children. She\npreviously worked as a teacher, but she has now returned to school. Her husband is a\nmedical doctor. Applicant speaks with his sisters by telephone one to three times a month.\nHe has frequently visited with his sisters in Lebanon since he immigrated to the United\nStates, including visits in April 2009, and April, August and December 2008. The April 2008\nvisit occurred when Applicant\u2019s child was born in Lebanon; the August 2008 visit occurred\nduring his father\u2019s funeral in Lebanon; and the April 2009 visit occurred when Applicant and\nhis family visited Lebanon to celebrate his son\u2019s birthday. \nApplicant\u2019s father-in-law is a 76-year-old citizen and resident of Lebanon. He is a\nretired accountant. Applicant\u2019s wife speaks with her father by telephone weekly to bi-\nweekly. Applicant\u2019s wife has two brothers. One lives in Canada and the other in Saudi\nArabia. \nApplicant was granted eligibility to hold a public trust position in or about 2004. No\nadverse action was ever taken to revoke or suspend that eligibility. There is no record\nevidence to suggest that Applicant at anytime risked the compromise of sensitive\ninformation while holding a public trust position.  \nApplicant\u2019s manager attests that Applicant is loyal, dedicated, discreet and\ntrustworthy. Two of Applicant\u2019s co-workers, including a United States Air Force Reserve\nSenior Master Sergeant, wrote that they have found Applicant to be an invaluable resource\nto the project they work on and that he is dedicated and diligent. Applicant\u2019s references all\nvouch for his integrity.\nA United States Department of State document entitled: Lebanon Country Specific\nInformation, dated August 20, 2008, provides the following information:\nThe Republic of Lebanon is a parliamentary republic. . . . Since 1973,\nLebanon has been in a state of war with Israel. . . .\n* * * \nAmericans have been the targets of numerous terrorist attacks in Lebanon\nin the past. The perpetrators of many of these attacks are still present and\nretain the ability to act. On January 15, 2008, a U.S. Embassy vehicle was\ninvolved in a bomb attack that killed three Lebanese bystanders. American\ncitizens should keep a low profile, varying times and routes for all required\ntravel. Americans should also pay close attention to their personal security\nat locations where Westerners are generally known to congregate, and\nshould avoid demonstrations and large gatherings. . . .\nPalestinian groups hostile to both the Lebanese government and the U.S.\noperate largely autonomously inside refugee camps in different areas of the\ncountry. . . . Asbat al-Ansar, a terrorist group with apparent links to Al-Qaida,\nhas targeted Lebanese, U.S. and other foreign government interests. \n\n5\n* * *  \nSPECIAL CIRCUMSTANCES: In addition to being subject to all Lebanese\nlaws, U.S. citizens who also possess Lebanese nationality may also be\nsubject to other laws that impose special obligations on them as Lebanese\ncitizens. Lebanese citizens who are discovered to have associated with or\ntraveled through Israel, are subject to arrest and detention. (GE 7)\nA United States Department of State Travel Warning, dated September 10, 2008,\nprovides the following information about Lebanon:\n. . . The Department of State continues to urge that Americans avoid all\ntravel to Lebanon. . . . \nRecent clashes in the northern city of Tripoli have resulted in more than\ntwenty deaths and numerous injuries, Additionally, a bomb exploded next to\na city bus in Tripoli on August 13, 2008 and killed fourteen people. The U.S.\nEmbassy advises U.S. citizens against all travel to Lebanon and\nrecommends that U.S. citizens in Lebanon consider the risk of remaining,\nparticularly in Tripoli in light of recent incidents there.\nOn May 7, 2008, Hizballah militants blocked the road to Rafiq Hariri\nInternational Airport. The action rendered the airport inaccessible and\ntravelers were unable to enter or leave the country via commercial air\ncarriers. Armed Hizballah and other opposition members proceeded to enter\nareas of Lebanon not traditionally under their control resulting in heavy\nfighting and a number of casualties. While there is now full access to the\nairport and widespread hostilities have subsided, the United States is\nconcerned about Hisballah\u2019s willingness to use violence to achieve political\nends with little or no warning.\nThe threat of anti-Western terrorist activity exists in Lebanon; groups such\nas Al-Qaeda and Jund al-sham are present in the country and have issued\nstatements calling for attacks against Western interests in the past. (GE 8)\nA United States Department of State document entitled: Country Reports on\nTerrorism 2008, dated April 30, 2009, provides the following information:\nHizballah was designated as a Foreign Terrorist Organization on October 8,\n1997. Formed in 1982, in response to the Israeli invasion of Lebanon, this\nLebanese based radical Shia group takes its ideological inspiration from the\nIranian revolution and the teachings of the late Ayatollah Khomeini. . . .\nHizballah is closely allied with Iran and often acts at its behest, though it also\nacts independently. . . .  Hizballah remains the most technically-capable\nterrorist group in the world. It has strong influence in Lebanon\u2019s Shia\ncommunity, which comprises about one-third of Lebanon\u2019s population. \n\n ISCR Case No. 96-0277 (July 11, 1997) at p. 2.\n3\n ISCR Case No. 97-0016 (December 31, 1997) at p. 3; Directive, Enclosure 3, Item E3.1.14. \n4\n Department of the Navy v. Egan 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988).\n5\n ISCR Case No. 01-20700 (December 19, 2002) at p. 3 (citations omitted).\n6\n ISCR Case No. 98-0761 (December 27, 1999) at p. 2.\n7\n ISCR Case No. 94-1075 (August 10, 1995) at pp. 3-4; Directive, Enclosure 3, Item E3.1.15.\n8\n ISCR Case No. 93-1390 (January 27, 1995) at pp. 7-8; Directive, Enclosure 3, Item E3.1.15.\n9\n6\n. . . Hizballah provides support to several Palestinian terrorist organizations,\nas well as a number of local Christian and Muslim militias in Lebanon. The\nsupport includes the covert provision of weapons, explosives, training,\nfunding, and guidance, as well as overt political support. \n* * *\nActivities: Hizballah is known to have been involved in numerous anti-U.S.\nand anti-Israeli terrorist attacks; prior to September 11, 2001, it was\nresponsible for more American deaths than any other terrorist group. (GE 12)\nPolicies\nThe Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines to consider when evaluating a\nperson\u2019s eligibility to hold a security clearance. Chief among them are the disqualifying\nconditions and mitigating conditions for each applicable guideline. Additionally, each\nclearance decision must be a fair and impartial common sense decision based upon the\nrelevant and material facts and circumstances, the whole person concept, and the factors\nlisted in \u00b6 6.3.1 through \u00b6 6.3.6 of the Directive. Although the presence or absence of a\nparticular condition or factor for or against clearance is not outcome determinative, the\nadjudicative guidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against this\npolicy guidance. Guideline B (foreign influence), with its disqualifying and mitigating\nconditions, is most relevant in this case. \n  \nThe sole purpose of a security clearance decision is to decide if it is clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for an\napplicant.  The government has the burden of proving controverted facts.  The burden of\n3\n4\nproof in a security clearance case is something less than a preponderance of evidence,5\nalthough the government is required to present substantial evidence to meet its burden of\nproof.  \u201cSubstantial evidence is more than a scintilla, but less than a preponderance of the\n6\nevidence.\u201d  Once the government has met its burden, the burden shifts to an applicant to\n7\npresent evidence of refutation, extenuation, or mitigation to overcome the case against\nhim.  Additionally, an applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable\n8\nclearance decision.9\n\n Egan, 484 U.S. at 528, 531.\n10\n Id at 531.\n11\n Egan, Executive Order 10865, and the Directive.\n12\n7\nNo one has a right to a security clearance  and \u201cthe clearly consistent standard\n10\nindicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of\ndenials.\u201d   Any reasonable doubt about whether an applicant should be allowed access\n11\nto classified information must be resolved in favor of protecting national security.      \n12\nAnalysis\nGuideline B, Foreign Influence \nForeign contacts and interests may be a security concern if the individual has\ndivided loyalties or financial interests, may be manipulated or induced to help a foreign\nperson, group, organization, or government in a way that is not in U.S. interests, or is\nvulnerable to pressure or coercion by any foreign interest. Adjudication under this\nGuideline can and should consider the identity of the foreign country in which the foreign\ncontact or financial interest is located, including, but not limited to, such considerations as\nwhether the foreign country is known to target United States citizens to obtain protected\ninformation and/or is associated with a risk of terrorism.\nApplicant\u2019s sisters are citizens and residents of Lebanon. Applicant has visited with\nhis sisters regularly, including four times within the past 14 months. He also maintains\nregular telephone contact with them. \nHis wife is a citizen of Lebanon and her father is a citizen and resident of Lebanon.\nShe resided in Lebanon until May 2007, when she married Applicant and moved to Qatar\nto reside with him. Applicant and his wife returned to Lebanon in April 2008, so she could\ngive birth to their child with the medical assistance of a physician with whom she was\ncomfortable. Applicant\u2019s wife maintains regular telephonic contact with her father and she\nand Applicant returned to Lebanon two months ago to celebrate their son\u2019s first birthday.\n \nApplicant\u2019s relationship with his sisters, and his relationship with his father-in-law\nthrough his wife, create security concerns under Disqualifying Condition (DC) 7(a): contact\nwith a foreign family member . . . or other person who is a citizen of or resident in a foreign\ncountry if that contact creates a heightened risk of foreign exploitation, inducement,\nmanipulation, pressure, or coercion; and DC 7(d): sharing living quarters with a person or\npersons, regardless of citizenship status, if that relationship creates a heightened risk of\nforeign inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion. \nI have considered the possible application of Mitigating Condition (MC) 8(a): the\nnature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in which these persons are\nlocated, or the positions or activities of those persons in that country are such that is\nunlikely the individual will be placed in a position of having to choose between the interests\nof a foreign individual, group, organization, or government and the interests of the U.S.;\n\n8\nand MC 8 (c): contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and infrequent\nthat there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign influence of exploitation.\nHaving done so, I conclude the continuing unrest in Lebanon caused by the terrorist\norganizations that operate therein along with Applicant\u2019s and his wife\u2019s relationship with his\nsisters and her father, including frequent phone calls to and visits with them in Lebanon,\npreclude application of these mitigating conditions.\nI have also considered the possible application of MC 8(b): there is no conflict of\ninterest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of loyalty or obligation to the foreign person\n. . . is so minimal, or the individual has such deep and longstanding relationships and\nloyalties in the U.S., that the individual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest\nin favor of the U.S. interest. There is no to reason to question or doubt Applicant\u2019s\nallegiance and loyalty to the United States to the exclusion of all other countries. However,\nhe maintains close ties with his sisters. His wife maintains close ties with her father, and,\nexcept for being married to Applicant, she has no ties to the United States. Additionally,\nthere is insufficient evidence to conclude how Applicant would resolve any conflict of\ninterest were it to arise. Accordingly, I conclude this mitigating condition does not apply.\nThe remaining mitigating conditions have no applicability to the facts of this case.   \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the\nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant\nconcerned.\u201d In this case, there is no reason to doubt that Applicant is a loyal American\ncitizen or suspect he would consider doing harm to the interests of the United States. Still,\nhis sisters\u2019 and father-in-law\u2019s Lebanese citizenship and their Lebanese residency create\na security concern that has not been overcome.    \nThe objective of the security clearance process is the fair-minded, common sense\nassessment of a person\u2019s trustworthiness and fitness for access to classified information.\nIndeed, the \u201cwhole person\u201d concept recognizes we should view a person by the totality of\ntheir acts and omissions.

Michael Lyles, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: James H. Drescher, Esquire \n                                \n______________\nDecision\n______________\nLEONARD, Michael H., Administrative Judge:\nApplicant contests the Defense Department\u2019s intent to deny or revoke his\neligibility for an industrial security clearance. Acting under the relevant Executive Order\nand DoD Directive,  the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a\n1\nstatement of reasons (SOR) to Applicant on October 28, 2007. The SOR is equivalent\nto an administrative complaint and it details the factual basis for the action. The issues\nin this case fall under Guideline B for foreign influence based on Applicant\u2019s ties or\nconnections to Iraq. For the reasons discussed below, this case is decided for\nApplicant. \n   \nIn addition to the Executive Order and Directive, this case is brought under the\nrevised Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified\nInformation (Revised Guidelines) approved by the President on December 29, 2005.\nThe Revised Guidelines were then modified by the Defense Department, effective\nMarch 28, 2008\n\n  See Memorandum from the Under Secretary of Defense for Intelligence, dated August 30, 2006, Subject:\n2\nImplementation of Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information\n(December 29, 2005). \n2\nSeptember 1, 2006. They supersede or replace the guidelines published in Enclosure 2\nto the Directive. They apply to all adjudications and other determinations where an SOR\nhas been issued on September 1, 2006, or thereafter.  The Directive is pending revision\n2\nor amendment. The Revised Guidelines apply here because the SOR is dated after the\neffective date.  \nApplicant replied to the SOR on November 10, 2007, and requested a hearing.\nThe case was assigned to me on December 26, 2007. The hearing took place as\nscheduled on February 7, 2008, and the transcript (Tr.) was received on February 19,\n2008.\nThe record was left open until February 21, 2008, to allow Applicant an\nopportunity to submit additional documentary evidence. No such matters were\nsubmitted.\nFindings of Fact\nThe SOR alleges that Applicant may be subject to foreign influence due to his\nfamily ties or connections to Iraq as well as his service in the Iraqi Army from about\n1985 to 1990. Applicant admits the factual allegations in SOR subparagraphs 1.a\u20131.d.\nIn addition, the following facts are established by substantial evidence. \nApplicant is a 41-year-old Arabic linguist and cultural advisor employed by a\nlanguage-related services company. He has worked for this company since June 2005.\nBorn in Iraq, he became a U.S. citizen in November 2002; he had held a U.S. passport\nsince January 2003. He changed his last name to a westernized name in light of the\nevents of 9/11. With an interim security clearance, he has already worked approximately\n18 months in Iraq where he was supporting the mission of the U.S. armed forces. This\nis the first time he has applied for a security clearance. \nIn 1985, Applicant was attending high school and living with his family when he\nwas conscripted to serve in the Iraqi Army. Although the Iran-Iraq war (1980\u20131988) was\nongoing, Applicant did not see duty in that conflict as he was assigned duties elsewhere\nworking as an electrician. In 1989 or 1990, Applicant was allowed to leave the army,\nand he returned to living with his family where he worked with his father selling auto\nparts (Exhibit B).\nIraq\u2014under the dictatorship of Saddam Hussein\u2014invaded Kuwait in August\n1990. As result, Applicant and many others who had previously served in the army were\nrecalled to duty. Applicant discussed the situation with his father and decided not to\nreturn to the army. He continued living with his family until Iraq was expelled from\nKuwait in February 1991. After the war, there were rebellions or uprisings in northern\n\n3\nand southern Iraq, which the Iraqi government responded to with crushing force against\nits own citizens. It was then that Applicant and one of his brothers decided to leave Iraq.\nThey were successful in fleeing Iraq, but soon found themselves in a refugee camp in\nnorthern Saudi Arabia where they spent the next couple of years under difficult\nconditions.\nApplicant and his brother were eventually granted political asylum in the U.S.\nthrough the assistance of U.N. representatives and U.S. immigration officials who\nvisited the refugee camp. In about 1994, Applicant and his brother were flown to the\nU.S. with the assistance of a religious organization that paid for the airfare. Their\ndestination in the U.S. was their current state of residence as they had a distant cousin\nliving there. Applicant arrived with the clothes on his back and he spoke little English. \nApplicant has been gainfully employed in the U.S. since approximately early\n1995, sometimes working two jobs. A neighbor helped Applicant find his first job as a\nbusboy at a Mexican restaurant. After about five months, Applicant started a second job\nat a restaurant known for its hamburgers. Applicant worked at this restaurant during\n1995\u20132005. He worked his way up the ladder in various positions until he was promoted\nto general manger. In addition to the restaurant business, Applicant worked as a retail\nsales associate for about three years during 2000\u20132003. A longtime soccer player,\nApplicant also plays semi-professional soccer for a local team. \nApplicant has immediate family members who are citizens of or residents in Iraq.\nHis mother and father are Iraqi citizens and live in Iraq. His mother has been a stay-at-\nhome mother and wife. His father is retired. During the 1960s\u20131980s, his father worked\nfor the Iraqi transportation department, and he receives a pension as a result. He\nworked selling auto parts after retiring from the transportation department. Applicant\nperiodically provides relatively small sums of money to his parents to supplement their\nretirement income. Applicant has regular (about twice a month) contact with his parents\nvia telephone calls. \nApplicant has two brothers and two sisters who are Iraqi citizens living in Iraq.\nOne sister is in the process of obtaining a divorce and she is living with her parents. The\nother sister has recently remarried and she is a housewife. Her first husband was\nexecuted before the fall of the Hussein regime, as he opposed the regime. One brother\nworks as a truck driver, and he is married with two children. Applicant\u2019s youngest\nbrother recently completed high school and is now going to college. Applicant is seeking\nto sponsor this brother\u2019s immigration to the U.S. and that process is pending. His\ncontact with his siblings in Iraq is usually incidental to his telephone calls to his parents. \nOther than his father\u2019s status as a pensioner, none of Applicant\u2019s immediate\nfamily members in Iraq are connected with the Iraqi government. \nApplicant also has a brother who is an Iraqi citizen living in Germany. This\nbrother works at a grocery store. He has lived in Germany for about ten years, and he is\n\n Department of Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988) (\u201cit should be obvious that no one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a\n3\nsecurity clearance\u201d); Duane v. Department of Defense, 275 F.3d 988, 994 (10  Cir. 2002) (\u201cIt is likewise plain\nth\nthat there is no \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance, so that full-scale due process standards do not apply to cases\nsuch as Duane\u2019s.\u201d).\n4\nin the process of obtaining German citizenship. His contact with this brother is limited to\na telephone call every three months or so.\nStarting in January 2006, Applicant worked as an Arabic linguist and cultural\nadvisor in Iraq for approximately 18 months. His assignment was to work as an\ninterpreter at a detainee facility where he was heavily involved with interrogating\ndetainees. According to several individuals who worked with him, Applicant\u2019s duty\nperformance was superb and his linguistic abilities were instrumental in the exploitation\nof detainees suspected of terrorist activities (Exhibit A). According to a task force senior\ninterrogator, an Army major, Applicant possesses several factors that give him the\n\u201cuncanny ability [to] identify weaknesses in the detainee for the interrogator to exploit\u201d\n(Exhibit A at 5). Likewise, another Army interrogator who testified at the hearing opined\nthat Applicant was easily one of the best interpreters at the facility because he had,\namong other things, the ability to \u201cchannel the emotions, the behavior and the body\nlanguage of the interrogator, he was literally a mouthpiece for us\u201d (Tr. 92). For his part,\nApplicant enjoyed the work and \u201cfelt like [he] was making a difference in a war against\nreligious extremists who were using their religion as an excuse to kill innocent people,\nincluding U.S. troops and Iraqi women and children\u201d (Exhibit B). \nApplicant did not visit his family when he was working in Iraq (Tr. 78). Other than\nhis mother, none of his family knew he was in Iraq. His mother knew he was in Iraq, but\nhe led her to believe he was there working for an American construction company. \nApplicant has no business, financial, or property interest in Iraq or any other\nforeign country. His financial affairs are all in the U.S. and, in general, consist of a\ncondo he has owned and lived in with his brother for the last several years, financial\naccounts worth about $45,000, and personal property. \nAdministrative notice is taken of certain facts about Iraq as described in the\ngovernment\u2019s written request (Exhibit 2). The situation in Iraq is well known within the\nDefense Department and it is unnecessary to repeat the specific details here. In general\nterms, the overall security situation in Iraq is fluid and at times quite unstable if not\ndeadly, but the situation has improved as of late. \nPolicies\nThis section sets forth the general principles of law and policies that apply to an\nindustrial security clearance case. To start, no one has a right to a security clearance.3\nAs noted by the Supreme Court in 1988 in the case of Department of Navy v. Egan, \u201cthe\nclearly consistent standard indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if\n\n Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.\n4\n Directive, \u00b6 3.2. \n5\n Directive, \u00b6 3.2. \n6\n ISCR Case No. 02-18663 (App. Bd.

Dec. 19, 2002) (citations omitted).\n12\n Executive Order 10865, \u00a7 7.\n13\n5\nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d  A favorable decision establishes eligibility of an\n4\napplicant to be granted a security clearance for access to confidential, secret, or top-\nsecret information.  An unfavorable decision (1) denies any application, (2)  revokes any\n5\nexisting security clearance, and (3) prevents access to classified information at any\nlevel.  Under Egan, Executive Order 10865, and the Directive, any doubt about whether\n6\nan applicant should be allowed access to classified information will be resolved in favor\nof protecting national security.\nThere is no presumption in favor of granting, renewing, or continuing eligibility for\naccess to classified information.  The government has the burden of presenting\n7\nevidence to establish facts alleged in the SOR that have been controverted.  An\n8\napplicant is responsible for presenting evidence to refute, explain, extenuate, or mitigate\nfacts that have been admitted or proven.  In addition, an applicant has the ultimate\n9\nburden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision.  In Egan, the Supreme\n10\nCourt stated that the burden of proof is less than a preponderance of the evidence.11\nThe agency appellate authority has followed the Court\u2019s reasoning, and a judge\u2019s\nfindings of fact are reviewed under the substantial-evidence standard.12\nThe Revised Guidelines set forth adjudicative guidelines to consider when\nevaluating a person\u2019s security clearance eligibility, including disqualifying conditions\n(DC) and mitigating conditions (MC) for each guideline. In addition, each clearance\ndecision must be a fair and impartial commonsense decision based upon consideration\nof all the relevant and material information, the pertinent criteria and adjudication\nfactors, and the whole-person concept. A person granted access to classified\ninformation enters into a special relationship with the government. The government\nmust be able to have a high degree of trust and confidence in those persons to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. The decision to deny a person a security\nclearance is not a determination of an applicant\u2019s loyalty.  Instead, it is a determination\n13\n\n Revised Guidelines at pp. 5\u20136 (setting forth the security concern and the disqualifying and mitigating\n14\nconditions for Guideline B). \n Revised Guidelines at p. 5. \n15\n Revised Guidelines at p. 5. \n16\n See ISCR Case No. 03-02382 at 5 (App. Bd. Feb. 15, 2006); ISCR Case No. 99-0424 (App. Bd. Feb. 8,\n17\n2001).\n6\nthat the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President has established for\ngranting eligibility for a security clearance.\nAnalysis\nUnder Guideline B for foreign influence,  a security concern may arise due to\n14\nforeign contacts and interests \u201cif the individual has divided loyalties or foreign financial\ninterests, may be manipulated or induced to help a foreign person, group, organization,\nor government in a way that is not in U.S. interests, or is vulnerable to pressure or\ncoercion by any foreign interest.\u201d  There are two disqualifying conditions  that could\n15\n16\nraise a security concern and may be disqualifying in this case:\nDC 1. [C]ontact with a foreign family member, business, or professional\nassociate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or a resident in a\nforeign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of foreign\nexploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; and \nDC 2. [C]onnections to a foreign person, group, government, or country\nthat create a potential conflict of interest between the individual\u2019s\nobligation to protect sensitive information or technology and the\nindividual\u2019s desire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing\nthat information. \nOf course, the mere possession of close family ties with a person in a foreign country is\nnot\u2014as a matter of law\u2014disqualifying under Guideline B. But if only one relative resides\nin a foreign country and an applicant has contact with that relative, this factor alone is\nsufficient to create the potential for foreign influence and could potentially result in the\ncompromise of classified information.17\nHere, the two disqualifying conditions apply because Applicant has contacts with\nand connections to immediate family members in Iraq. He comes from a large family,\nmost of whom live in Iraq. He has regular telephonic contact with his parents and\nsometimes his siblings. These circumstances create the potential for a heightened risk\nof foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion because of his\nties to immediate family members in Iraq. Also, the circumstance of his financial support\nto his parents is material because it indicates the strength of his family ties. It is not\nenough to constitute a substantial business, financial, or property interest in a foreign\n\n Revised Guidelines at p. 6. \n18\n See ISCR Case No. 07-00034 at 2 (App. Bd. Feb. 5, 2008) (\u201can applicant\u2019s proven record of action in\n19\ndefense of the U.S. is very important and can lead to a favorable result for an applicant in a Guideline B\ncase.\u201d) (citation omitted). \n7\ncountry, however, and the fifth disqualifying condition under the guideline does not\napply. Finally, the circumstance of his service in the Iraqi Army is not particularly\nmaterial because (1) he was a conscript, (2) he refused to return to duty when recalled,\nand (3) it occurred before he was a U.S. citizen. \nThree of the six mitigating conditions  under the guideline may apply to the facts\n18\nand circumstances of this case:\nMC 1.  [T]he nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country\nin which these persons are located, or the positions or activities of those\npersons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be\nplaced in a position of having to choose between the interests of a foreign\nindividual, group, organization, or government and the interests of the\nU.S.;\nMC 2.  [T]here is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s\nsense of loyalty or obligation to the foreign person, group, government, or\ncountry is so minimal, or the individual has such deep and longstanding\nrelationships and loyalties in the U.S., that the individual can be expected\nto resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the U.S. interest; and\nMC 3.  [C]ontact or communications with foreign citizens is so casual and\ninfrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign\ninfluence or exploitation. \nThe first and third MC do not apply because Applicant\u2019s relationships with his\nimmediate family members in Iraq are of sufficient magnitude or strength to negate\nthese two MCs. In the post-9/11 world, there is at least a remote or slight possibility that\ndangerous elements within Iraq could attempt to use his family members to coerce or\npressure Applicant.\nBut the second MC applies in Applicant\u2019s favor. The record evidence supports a\nconclusion that Applicant has a depth of loyalty to the U.S., so that he can be expected\nto resolve any conflict in favor of the U.S. interest. He demonstrated his depth of his\ncommitment to the U.S. by working approximately 18 months supporting the U.S. armed\nforces in Iraq.  His work was not minor or trivial, as he performed important duty as an\n19\nArabic interpreter who participated in the interrogation of detainees (Exhibit A). \n \n\n Revised Guidelines at p. 5.\n20\n8\nTo sum up under the whole-person concept, this is not a case of \u201cdivided\nloyalties\u201d  with an applicant who has one foot in the U.S. and one foot in his native\n20\ncountry. On the contrary, the evidence shows Applicant has both feet planted in the\nU.S. and that he has significant contacts and ties to the U.S. For example, Applicant\u2019s\nemployment, financial, and property interests are in the U.S. By all appearances,\nApplicant and his brother have made the U.S. their home and that is their future. His\nwork on behalf of the U.S. in a war zone is further evidence of the strength of his ties to\nthe U.S. This circumstance and the favorable character evidence deserve substantial\nweight. Taken together, these circumstances support a conclusion that Applicant can be\nexpected to resolve any potential foreign influence or pressure by either coercive or\nnon-coercive means in favor of the U.S. interest. \nIn addition, given that the U.S. is producing relatively few Arabic speakers, this is\na skill set that cannot be ignored. Also, Applicant\u2019s language skills are enhanced by his\nunderstanding of the country and cultural nuances that might be lost on a foreign Arabic\nspeaker. This circumstance does not dictate the outcome of the case, but it does\nreceive some consideration under the whole-person concept. \nTo conclude, based on the record evidence as a whole, both favorable and\nunfavorable, Applicant has presented sufficient evidence to explain, extenuate, or\nmitigate the foreign influence security concern. Applicant met his ultimate burden of\npersuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision. This case is decided for Applicant. \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline B:\nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.a\u20131.d:\n \nFor Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances, it is clearly consistent with national interest  to\ngrant Applicant eligibility for a security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified\ninformation is granted.\nMichael H. Leonard\nAdministrative Judge \n",

Borgstrom, Esq. Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Sheldon I. Cohen, Esq. \n \n \n______________ \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \n \nFOREMAN, LeRoy F., Administrative Judge: \n \nApplicant submitted his Security Clearance Application (SF 86) on February 4, \n2005.  On October 27, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) \nissued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the basis for its preliminary decision to \ndeny his application, citing security concerns under Guideline B (Foreign Influence). The \naction was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information \nwithin Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) \npromulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective within the \nDepartment of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006.  \n  \n \nApplicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on November 2, 2007; answered it \non November 16, 2007; and requested a hearing before an administrative judge. DOHA \nreceived the request on November 19, 2007. Department Counsel was prepared to \nproceed on December 7, 2007, and the case was assigned to me on December 12, \n2007. DOHA issued a notice of hearing on February 6, 2008, setting the case for \nFebruary 27, 2008. I convened the hearing as scheduled. Government Exhibits (GX) 1 \nApril 22, 2008\n\n \n2 \n \n \nand 2 were admitted in evidence without objection. Applicant testified on his own behalf, \npresented the testimony of five witnesses, and submitted Applicant\u2019s Exhibits (AX) A \nthrough EE, which were admitted without objection. AX FF and GG were offered and \nthen withdrawn. \n \nI granted Applicant\u2019s request to keep the record open until March 7, 2008 to \nenable Applicant to submit additional evidence.  Applicant timely submitted AX HH, to \nwhich Department Counsel objected (HX IV). My ruling on Department Counsel\u2019s \nobjection is set out below. The record closed on March 7, 2008. DOHA received the \ntranscript of the hearing (Tr.) on March 11, 2008. Eligibility for access to classified \ninformation is granted. \n \nProcedural and Evidentiary Rulings \n \nAdministrative Notice \n \nDepartment Counsel and Applicant\u2019s counsel both requested that I take \nadministrative notice of relevant facts about the Republic of India. Department \nCounsel\u2019s request is attached to the record as Hearing Exhibit (HX) I, and Applicant\u2019s \nrequest is HX II.  The facts administratively noticed are set out below in my findings of \nfact. \n \nI took administrative notice as requested by Department Counsel, except for the \nfacts based on Enclosures 5 and 6 to HX I. I determined that Enclosure 5, the Annual \nReport to Congress on Foreign Economic Collection and Industrial Espionage for the \nyear 2000, was too old and its basis for its conclusions were too limited to be a reliable \nsource of current information.  See ISCR Case No. 03-21434 at 4-5 (App. Bd. Feb. 20, \n2007). I determined that Enclosure 6, the Annual Report to Congress on Foreign \nEconomic Collection and Industrial Espionage for the year 2005 is based on the same \nmethodology as Enclosure 5, and is too limited to be the basis for administrative notice \nabout India, since the only reference to India in the report is one incident in 2004 where \na U.S. software manufacturer reported that a source code and confidential design \ndocuments were stolen from a research and development center in India. I offered \nDepartment Counsel the opportunity to offer these three documents as government \nexhibits, akin to learned treatises under Fed. R. Evid. 803(18), to be given whatever \nweight I determined appropriate in my decision, and he accepted that offer. The \nenclosures to HX I were marked as GX 3 and 4 and admitted without objection.  \n \nI also took administrative notice as requested by Applicant\u2019s counsel, except for \nthe matters on page 16 of HX II, which are based on a report from Human Rights \nWatch, an advocacy group, and the matters on pages 17-22, which are argument rather \nthan a recitation of facts (Tr. 68-69).  \n \n\n \n3 \n \n \nMemorandum of Law \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s counsel submitted a memorandum of law for my consideration, \nattached to the record as HX III. \n \nEvidence of Detention and Interrogation of Suspected Terrorists \n \nApplicant submitted evidence that the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) has \ndetained suspected terrorists in secret locations and used harsh interrogation methods \n(AX HH).  Department Counsel objected on the ground that the evidence was irrelevant \n(HX IV). After examining the proffered evidence and considering Department Counsel\u2019s \nobjection, I have determined that the evidence is irrelevant to the question whether \nApplicant\u2019s family, financial, and military connections to India raise security concerns \nthat have not been mitigated. Accordingly, AX HH is attached to the record but not \nadmitted. \n \nCorrection of Transcript \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s counsel submitted a list of corrections to the transcript.  Department \nCounsel objected to the corrections changing the date of Applicant\u2019s entry into the U.S. \nfrom 1993 to 1992 and correcting the spelling of Applicant\u2019s sister\u2019s name. For the \npurposes of this decision, I have accepted 1992 as the date of Applicant\u2019s entry into the \nU.S., because he provided that date on his SF 86 (GX 1 at 5, question 12). The \ncorrected spelling of his sister\u2019s name is consistent with AX B and has no decisional \nimportance. The list of proposed corrections and an annotated copy of the transcript are \nattached to the record as HX V. Department Counsel\u2019s comments regarding the \ncorrections are attached as HX VI. \n \nAmendment of the SOR \n \n \nAt the conclusion of the hearing, Department Counsel moved to amend the SOR \nby adding two allegations based on evidence adduced during the hearing.  First, he \nmoved to amend the SOR by adding an allegation that Applicant owns two \ncondominiums in India worth a total of $20,000. This information was provided by \nApplicant on his SF 86 (GX 1 at 5) and repeated at the hearing. Second, he moved to \namend the SOR by adding an allegation that Applicant has a brother-in-law and sister-\nin-law who are citizens and residents of India. Applicant objected to both amendments.  \nI denied the motion (Tr. 200). However, I have considered the significance of Applicant\u2019s \nbrother-in-law and sister-in-law in determining whether the disqualifying condition under \nAG \u00b6 7(d) is raised. I have considered all his property interests in India, including the \ncondominiums, in my whole-person analysis and in determining whether the security \nconcerns based on the property interests alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c and 1.e are mitigated. \n \n \nOn my own motion, I have amended SOR \u00b6 1.d to conform to the evidence by \nchanging the beginning date of Applicant\u2019s service in the Indian Navy from 1965 to \n1969. \n\n \n4 \n \n \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn his answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted all the factual allegations, disputing \nonly his length of service in the Indian Navy (SOR \u00b6 1.d). His admissions in his answer \nto the SOR and at the hearing are incorporated in my findings of fact. I make the \nfollowing findings: \n \n \nApplicant is a 59-year-old native of India.  He attended the National Defense \nAcademy in India from 1965 to 1969, was commissioned as an officer in the Indian \nNavy, rose to the grade of commander, and retired in 1991. He served several tours at \nsea, serving in the coastal waters of India. He held a security clearance while serving \naboard ships, but he was not involved in intelligence work (Tr. 172). He was never \ninvolved in any joint operations with Iran (Tr. 172). He and his wife described their lives \nin the Navy in Spartan terms\u2014low pay, frequent moves, poor housing, and poor food \n(Tr. 106, 144-45). \n \nApplicant receives retirement pay for his Navy service of about $230 per month, \nwhich is deposited in a bank account in India. The bank account is used solely to \nreceive his Navy retired pay (Tr. 155). He has no contact with friends or former \ncolleagues in the Indian Navy, because he is a U.S. citizen and the Indian Navy restricts \nits officers from interaction with foreigners (Tr. 183). \n \nApplicant came to the U.S. in 1992, sponsored by his older brother. After coming \nto the U.S., Applicant worked as a life insurance salesman and a software salesman, \nuntil he founded his own company in 1999 (Tr. 146-47). His company has about 15 \nemployees and provides information technology consulting. He is the president, chief \nexecutive officer and sole owner of the company.  Even though he does not hold a \nclearance, his company has several classified contracts (Tr. 133). He estimates the \nvalue of his business to be $5.7 million (AX A). \n \nApplicant and his wife were married in India in September 1973. Both families \ndisapproved of the marriage because Applicant is Hindu and his wife is Parsi. Only his \nmother and one of his six sisters attended his wedding. His mother attended to perform \nHindu rites (Tr. 140). He became a U.S. citizen in June 2000, and his wife became a \nU.S. citizen in September 2003. They have three adult children who are all naturalized \nU.S. citizens. When asked why he became a U.S. citizen, he responded as follows: \n \nSir, I love this country. I will tell you why I love this country . . . Americans \ndo not know how great is this country because they don\u2019t go out and see \nthe sufferings in a third world country. \n \nWhich is the country in the world that allow [an immigrant like me] to come \nto 6.7 million dollars of net worth in 16 years? Which country where three \nwhite girls will decide to marry my nephews? And which country one white \nmale will decide to marry my niece? That\u2019s why you were saying that you \n\n \n5 \n \n \nsaw some Italian, Polish [guests at my son\u2019s wedding]. They\u2019re my \ndaughter-in-laws and our grandchildren. \n \nWhich country will worship Jesus Christ and Hindu gods together? My wife \ndoes it. They said . . . do you denounce India and the liberation of it. I say, \n\u201cI do!\u201d because I am out of that nonsense. That\u2019s why I love this country. \n \n(Tr. 166-67.) \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s wife works as the office manager for Applicant\u2019s business (Tr. 104). \nHer father died in 1983 (Tr. 108). Her 85-year-old mother lives in India. Applicant\u2019s wife \nhas a brother and sister in India, but she has virtually no contact with them (Tr. 129). \nShe last spoke with her mother at her son\u2019s wedding, where her mother performed a \nreligious rite, about a year before the hearing. She occasionally calls her mother to \ncheck on her well-being (Tr. 108).  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s parents are deceased. He traveled to India in 1999 for his father\u2019s \nfuneral. He visited his gravely ill mother in July 2000 and returned to India later that year \nfor her funeral. He traveled to India in December 2000 for a niece\u2019s wedding and in \nJanuary 2005 for a nephew\u2019s wedding (Tr. 162-64). Even though he is not close to his \nsisters, he attended because they insisted he come and perform a Hindu rite (Tr. 182). \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s brother is a U.S. citizen and resident and works in the U.S. as an \nengineer. One sister is a U.S. citizen and resident and works as an insurance \nunderwriter.  He has six other sisters who are citizens and residents of India. One is a \ngynecologist; the other five are housewives (AX B). Three of his sisters have children in \nthe U.S. who are married to U.S. citizens, and they visit them regularly (Tr. 183-85). \nTwo of his sisters have green cards and spend considerable time in the U.S., and one \nof them aspires to become a U.S. citizen (Tr. 142), He has contact with his sisters in \nIndia by mail or telephone about twice a year. None of his sisters are employed by or \nhave any connection with the government of India.  Four of his sister\u2019s spouses are \nretired, one is an ophthalmic surgeon, and one is a civil engineer. None have any \nconnection with the government of India except the civil engineer, who sometimes \nworks on government contracts. (Tr. 159-61, 169-70). \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s mother-in-law is a citizen of Iran residing in India. She is a native of \nIndia.  At age 15, she married an Iranian and was persuaded by her husband to become \nan Iranian citizen. She is 85 years old and has spent a total of about 30 days of her life \nin Iran. She went to Iran in 1983 to offer prayers for her deceased husband (Tr. 112-14; \nTAB C). She speaks a dialect that Applicant cannot speak or understand, and her \nEnglish is rudimentary. Applicant testified he feels no affection for or obligation to his \nmother-in-law because of the suffering she has inflicted on his wife (Tr. 187). \n \n \nApplicant owns his home and a rental property in the U.S. (Tr. 153). He owns two \nsmall condominiums in India that he bought while he was in the Indian Navy. He \nestimates that together they are worth about $20,000. They are vacant because he has \n\n \n6 \n \n \nbeen unable to sell them (Tr. 173-76). He does not rent them for fear that squatters will \noccupy them. He regards them as a burden. He testified, \u201cI hope that somebody can \ntake it away and get the hell out of this.\u201d (Tr. 174.) \n \n \nA retired U.S. Navy admiral who worked for a defense contractor and became a \nmentor for Applicant testified on his behalf.  When they first became acquainted, they \nfelt \u201ca very close bond between seamen.\u201d  Based on five years of regular contact, the \nadmiral regards Applicant\u2019s character as \u201cabsolutely top of the line.\u201d  He strongly \nbelieves Applicant should have a clearance (Tr. 40-43). \n \n \nAn employee of a federal contractor who employed Applicant as a subcontractor \ndescribed him as very reliable, responsible, and responsive (Tr. 54-55). The witness, a \nNaval Academy graduate who has held a clearance for many years, knew Applicant\u2019s \nfamily, attended his son\u2019s wedding, and described him as very family oriented, trying to \npass on his family values to his children (Tr. 57).  The witness recommended strongly \nApplicant be granted a clearance (Tr. 60). \n \n \nApplicant served for two years as vice-president and two years as president of a \ncharitable, community, and social organization composed of about 200 families from the \nsame region in India. A physician and friend of Applicant who served with him in the \norganization testified he found Applicant to be very responsible, discrete, dependable, \nand trustworthy (Tr. 85-94). \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s neighbor for more than four years testified described Applicant as \u201cof \nthe highest integrity . . . completely trustworthy, incredibly smart, [and] incredibly \nworldly.\u201d  She regards him as a good neighbor who is very generous, kind, open and \nhelpful (Tr. 108-09). \n \n \nGovernment documents presented by Department Counsel reflect concern in the \nU.S. Congress about India\u2019s increasing cooperation with Iran and transfers of \nequipment and technology related to weapons of mass destruction to Iran by Indian \ncompanies (GX 4). The documents also reflect that in the year 2000 India was as a \nmajor practitioner of industrial espionage (GX 5). None of the documents suggest, \nhowever, that India abuses its citizens as a means of collecting economic intelligence. \n \nI have taken administrative notice of the facts below. India\u2019s Constitution \ndescribes it as a \u201csovereign, socialist, secular democratic republic.\u201d  It is a multiparty, \nfederal, parliamentary democracy. The U.S. and India are the world\u2019s largest \ndemocracies. The U.S. is India\u2019s largest trading partner and largest investment partner.  \nIn the past, U.S. policy toward India was dominated by concerns over India\u2019s nuclear \nweapons programs and slow pace of economic reforms.  More recently, the U.S. has \nregarded India as a growing world power with which it shares common strategic \ninterests.  Since 2004, bilateral cooperation between the U.S. and India has significantly \nincreased in civil nuclear, civil space, and high-technology commerce.  In December \n2006, Congress passed the United States-India Peaceful Atomic Cooperation Act, \nwhich clears the way for India to buy U.S. nuclear reactors and fuel for civilian use.  In \n\n \n7 \n \n \nJuly 2007, The U.S. and India completed negotiations for peaceful nuclear cooperation \nthat will open the door for U.S. and Indian firms to participate in each other\u2019s civil \nnuclear energy sector. \n \nThe primary missions of the Indian Navy are to defend India and its vital sea \nlanes of communication. India is an active member of the United Nations with a long \ntradition of participating in United Nations peacekeeping operations. \n \nThe government of India generally respects the rights of its citizens, but it has \nexperienced major problems with extrajudicial killings of persons in custody, harsh \nprison conditions, lengthy pretrial detention without trial, disappearances, and torture \nand rape by police and security forces. Physical abuse and excessive force have been \nused to combat terrorism and suppress violent insurgencies operating primarily in the \nnortheast part of the country. Human rights violations often go unpunished because of \nlack of accountability and endemic corruption in the government and police forces. A \nnumber of anti-Western terrorist groups are active in India. There have been terrorist \nattacks in public markets, public transportation, and places of worship, but U.S. citizens \nwere not specifically targeted in those attacks. \n \nPolicies \n \n \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988).  As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \ncontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d  Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified.   \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). These guidelines are not \ninflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these \nguidelines are applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s over-arching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common \nsense decision. An administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \n \n \nThe government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \n\n \n8 \n \n \nClearance decisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no \nsense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d  See Exec. Or. \n10865 \u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is not necessarily a \ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant.  It is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance \n \n \nInitially, the government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d  See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994).  The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the \ncriteria listed therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 \nat 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).   \n \n \nOnce the government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts.  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.  An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that \nit is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security \nclearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity \nclearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 \nU.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nThe SOR alleges Applicant\u2019s mother-in-law is a citizen of Iran residing in India (\u00b6 \n1.a); his six sisters are citizens and residents of India (\u00b6 1.b); he receives a pension \nfrom the Indian Government for his service in the Indian Navy (\u00b6 1.c); he served in the \nIndian Navy from 1965 to 1991 (\u00b6 1.d); he has a bank account in India (\u00b6 1.e); and he \ntraveled to India in January-February 1999, July 2000, November 2000, December \n1000, and January 2005 (\u00b6 1.f). SOR \u00b6 1.d has been amended to allege Navy service \nbeginning in 1969 instead of 1965. The security concern under Guideline B is as \nfollows: \n \nForeign contacts and interests may be a security concern if the individual \nhas divided loyalties or foreign financial interests, may be manipulated or \ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a \nway that is not in U.S. interests, or is vulnerable to pressure or coercion by \nany foreign interest. Adjudication under this Guideline can and should \nconsider the identity of the foreign country in which the foreign contact or \nfinancial interest is located, including, but not limited to, such \nconsiderations as whether the foreign country is known to target United  \n\n \n9 \n \n \nStates citizens to obtain protected information and/or is associated with a \nrisk of terrorism. \n \nAG \u00b6 6. \n \n \nA disqualifying condition under this guideline may be raised by \u201ccontact with a \nforeign family member, business or professional associate, friend, or other person who \nis a citizen of or resident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of \nforeign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion.\u201d AG \u00b6 7(a). Under \nthe old guidelines in effect before September 1, 2006, a disqualifying condition arose \nmerely from the existence of foreign contacts, without any analysis of the level of risk \nposed by those contacts. Under the new guidelines, a disqualifying condition does not \narise unless a foreign contact creates a \u201cheightened risk.\u201d The term \u201cheightened\u201d is not \ndefined in the guidelines, nor has it been addressed by the Appeal Board. I construe the \nterm \u201cheightened risk\u201d to mean a risk greater than would exist absent the foreign \ncontact. The fact that the risk is \u201cheightened\u201d does not mean it is unacceptable, but a \n\u201cheightened risk\u201d must be explained, extenuated, or mitigated. Applicant has no \ncontacts with his former colleagues in the Indian Navy, but his foreign family contacts \nare sufficient to raise AG \u00b6 7(a). \n \n \nA disqualifying condition also may be raised by \u201cconnections to a foreign person, \ngroup, government, or country that create a potential conflict of interest between the \nindividual\u2019s obligation to protect sensitive information or technology and the individual\u2019s \ndesire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing that information.\u201d AG \u00b6 \n7(b). Applicant\u2019s connections to his sisters and in-laws in India are sufficient to raise this \ndisqualifying condition. \n \n \nA security concern may be raised if an applicant is \u201csharing living quarters with a \nperson or persons, regardless of citizenship status, if that relationship creates a \nheightened risk of foreign inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion\u201d AG \u00b6 7(d). \nA[T]here is a rebuttable presumption that a person has ties of affection for, or obligation \nto, the immediate family members of the person's spouse.@ ISCR Case No. 01-03120, \n2002 DOHA LEXIS 94 at * 8 (App. Bd. Feb. 20, 2002). Applicant has no contact with his \nbrother-in-law and sister-in-law and no feeling of affection or obligation for his mother-in-\nlaw. To the contrary, he resents the pain his mother-in-law has inflicted on his wife. I \nconclude he has rebutted this presumption of affection or obligation toward his in-laws. \nHowever, Applicant\u2019s wife still feels an obligation to occasionally check on her mother\u2019s \nwelfare, even though she is estranged from her family. Applicant and his wife felt an \nobligation to include his mother-in-law in their son\u2019s wedding ceremony. Although the \nevidence of \u201cheightened risk\u201d is sparse, it is \u201cmore than a scintilla.\u201d Considering all the \nevidence, I conclude there is a \u201cheightened risk\u201d that Applicant could be subjected to \ndirect or indirect inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion.  Accordingly, I \nconclude AG \u00b6 7(d) is raised. \n \n \nA security concern also may be raised by \u201ca substantial business, financial, or \nproperty interest in a foreign country, or in any foreign-owned or foreign-operated \n\n \n10 \n \n \nbusiness, which could subject the individual to heightened risk of foreign influence or \nexploitation.\u201d AG \u00b6 7(e). Applicant regards his retired pay from the Indian Navy as an \ninsignificant pittance, and the sole purpose of the bank account is to receive his retired \npay. His two condominiums are worth about $20,000, and he has tried to protect them \nfrom squatters and dispose of them for a reasonable price. He has held onto them for \n20 years, because his frugal nature prevents him to selling them for less than their \nvalue. Although these properties represent a small part of his net wealth, the totality of \nhis financial interests in India are sufficient to raise AG \u00b6 7(e). \n \n \nSince the government produced substantial evidence to raise the disqualifying \ncondition in AG \u00b6\u00b6 7(a) and (b), the burden shifted to Applicant to produce evidence to \nrebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. Applicant has the \nburden of proving a mitigating condition, and the burden of disproving it never shifts to \nthe government.  See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).  \n \n \nSecurity concerns under this guideline can be mitigated by showing that \u201cthe \nnature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in which these persons are \nlocated, or the positions or activities of those persons in that country are such that it is \nunlikely the individual will be placed in a position of having to choose between the \ninterests of a foreign individual, group, organization, or government and the interests of \nthe U.S.\u201d AG \u00b6 8(a). The totality of an applicant\u2019s family ties to a foreign country as well \nas each individual family tie must be considered. ISCR Case No. 01-22693 at 7 (App. \nBd. Sep. 22, 2003).  \n \n \nGuideline B is not limited to countries hostile to the United States.  \u201cThe United \nStates has a compelling interest in protecting and safeguarding classified information \nfrom any person, organization, or country that is not authorized to have access to it, \nregardless of whether that person, organization, or country has interests inimical to \nthose of the United States.\u201d  ISCR Case No. 02-11570 at 5 (App. Bd. May 19, 2004). \n \n \nFurthermore, friendly nations can have profound disagreements with the United \nStates over matters they view as important to their vital interests or national security. \nFinally, we know friendly nations have engaged in espionage against the United States, \nespecially in the economic, scientific, and technical fields.  See ISCR Case No. \n00-0317, 2002 DOHA LEXIS 83 at **15-16 (App. Bd. Mar. 29, 2002).  Nevertheless, the \nnature of a nation\u2019s government, its relationship with the U.S., and its human rights \nrecord are relevant in assessing the likelihood that an applicant\u2019s family members are \nvulnerable to government coercion. The risk of coercion, persuasion, or duress is \nsignificantly greater if the foreign country has an authoritarian government, a family \nmember is associated with or dependent upon the government or the country is known \nto conduct intelligence operations against the U.S. \n \n \nNone of Applicant\u2019s siblings in India are connected to or dependent on the \ngovernment of India.  None of their spouses have any connection to the government, \nexcept for one brother-in-law who has construction contracts with the government. His \n\n \n11 \n \n \nsiblings in India and their families are not involved in high technology businesses that \nwould lend themselves to being practitioners or targets of economic espionage. \n \n \nIndia is a friendly country, a democracy, and a strategic and economic partner.  \nWhile it has experienced human rights abuses, many of those abuses were due to an \nantiquated and inefficient legal system, a government campaign against terrorism and \nviolent insurgencies, and an undisciplined and unsupervised law enforcement system.  \nAlthough India has been identified as a practitioner of economic espionage, there is no \nevidence that it uses torture or abuse of its citizens to extract economic information.  \nThe U.S. and India have had serious disagreements in the past, and India\u2019s \nrelationships with Iran have raised some concerns, but the relationship between the \nU.S. and India has evolved into a close economic, technological, and strategic \npartnership. Given its vibrant and close relationship with the U.S., it is unlikely India \nwould risk damaging that relationship by abusing its own citizens to coerce a U.S. \ncitizen to betray his country.  I conclude AG \u00b6 8(a) is established. \n \n \nSecurity concerns under this guideline also can be mitigated by showing \u201cthere is \nno conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of loyalty or obligation to the \nforeign person, group, government, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such \ndeep and longstanding relationships and loyalties in the U.S., that the individual can be \nexpected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the U.S. interest.\u201d AG \u00b6 8(b).  \n \nUnder the old adjudicative guidelines, a disqualifying condition based on foreign \nfamily members could not be mitigated unless an applicant could establish that the \nfamily members were not \u201cin a position to be exploited.\u201d Directive \u00b6 E2.A2.1.3.1. The \nAppeal Board consistently applied this mitigating condition narrowly, holding that an \napplicant should not be placed in a position where he or she is forced to make a choice \nbetween the interests of the family member and the interests of the U.S. See ISCR \nCase No. 03-17620 at 4 (App. Bd. Apr. 17, 2006); ISCR Case No. 03-24933 at 6 (App. \nBd. Jul. 28, 2005); ISCR Case No. 03-02382 at 5 (App. Bd. Feb. 15, 2005); ISCR Case \nNo. 03-15205 at 3 (App. Bd. Jan. 21, 2005).  Thus, an administrative judge was not \npermitted to apply a balancing test to assess the extent of the security risk.  Under the \nnew guidelines, however, the potentially conflicting loyalties may be weighed to \ndetermine if an applicant \u201ccan be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of \nthe U.S. interest.\u201d   \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s sense of loyalty or obligation to his in-laws in India is \u201cminimal,\u201d but it \nis not with respect to his sisters and their children. He retains some ties to his sisters, \nand his culture and heritage, but his family ties were seriously weakened by his family\u2019s \ndisapproval of his marriage. On the other hand, his loyalties and relationships in the \nU.S. are very strong. Two siblings are U.S. citizens, two sisters in India hold U.S. green \ncards, and one aspires to obtain U.S. citizenship. Applicant is deeply involved in his \ncommunity and his work. He has gained the respect and confidence of retired senior \nmilitary officers. By hard work and determination, he has built a successful company in \nthe U.S. He expressed great affection for the U.S. and its values during his testimony at \nthe hearing. I am satisfied that, in the unlikely event a conflict of interest should arrive, \n\n \n12 \n \n \nApplicant would resolve the conflict in favor of the U.S. I conclude AG \u00b6 8(b) is \nestablished.  \n \n \nSecurity concerns under this guideline also may be mitigated by showing that \n\u201ccontact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and infrequent that there is \nlittle likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign influence or exploitation.\u201d AG \u00b6 8(c).  \nThere is a rebuttable presumption that contacts with an immediate family member in a \nforeign country are not casual.  ISCR Case No. 00-0484 at 5 (App. Bd. Feb. 1, 2002). \nThis mitigating condition is established for Applicant\u2019s in-laws, but not for his sisters \nliving in India. \nFinally, where foreign financial or property interests are involved, security \nconcerns may be mitigated by showing that \u201cthe value or routine nature of the foreign \nbusiness, financial, or property interests is such that they are unlikely to result in a \nconflict and could not be used effectively to influence, manipulate, or pressure the \nindividual.\u201d AG \u00b6 8(f). Applicant regards his Navy retired pay as an insignificant pittance.  \nHe uses it for spending money when he travels to India. He receives no income from his \ncondominiums and regards them as a burden, but he has not disposed of them. I \nconclude AG \u00b6 8(f) is not established because of the potential conflict, but I am satisfied \nApplicant would resolve any conflict in favor of the U.S. \nApplicant\u2019s travel to India has no independent security significance, because it \nwas solely to visit family members and to attempt to dispose of his property in India. \nSee ISCR Case No. 02-26978 (App. Bd. Sep 21, 2005). \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which \nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and \nother permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept. Some of the factors in \nAG \u00b6 2(a) were addressed above, but some warrant additional comment. \n \n\n \n13 \n \n \n \nApplicant spent the first part of his adult life in the Indian Navy, but came to the \nU.S. in search of a better life. By hard work and initiative, he appears to have achieved \nthe American dream. He is financially secure, his children are well-educated and \nsuccessful, his wife is happy, and he is highly respected by colleagues in his field.  He \nloves the U.S. for its religious, economic, educational, and political freedom. He has two \nsiblings who are U.S. citizens, another who aspires to follow her children to the U.S. and \nbecome a U.S. citizen, and another who holds a green card. While he has financial \ninterests in India, those interests pale when compared to his financial interests in the \nU.S. Many years ago, he defied family, culture, and tradition to marry his wife. His ties \nto his sisters, nephews, and nieces in India are heavily outweighed by his strong ties to \nhis family in the U.S. and his passionate attachment to the U.S. and its values. His \ntestimony at the hearing was sincere, intense, and credible. He is talented and \ndedicated, and the interests of the U.S. would be advanced by using his talent and \ndedication. \n \n \nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under Guideline B, and \nevaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has \nmitigated the security concerns based on foreign influence. Accordingly, I conclude he \nhas carried his burden of showing that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to \ngrant him eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nI make the following formal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set \nforth in the SOR, as required by Directive \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline B (Foreign Influence):  \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.f: \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

Coacher, Esquire, Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro Se \n \n \n \n______________ \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \n \nHEINY, Claude R., Administrative Judge: \n \nApplicant was born in Hong Kong, is a naturalized U.S. citizen, and has lived in \nthe United States since 1993. Applicant\u2019s grandmother and uncle are citizens and \nresidents of Hong Kong. His mother and sister are dual citizens of the United States and \nHong Kong living in the U.S. His fianc\u00e9e is a legal resident of the U.S., a citizen of Hong \nKong, who has lived in the U.S. since 2000. \n \nAfter a thorough review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and evidence, I \nconclude Applicant has rebutted or mitigated the government\u2019s security concerns under \nguideline B, foreign influence. Based upon a review of the case file, pleadings, and \nexhibits, eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \n \n \nApplicant contests the Defense Department\u2019s intent to deny or revoke his \neligibility for an industrial security clearance. Acting under the relevant Executive Order \nand DoD Directive,1 the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a \n \n \n \n1\n                                                          \n1 Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as \namended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance \nReview Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) \nApril 10, 2008\n\n \n \n \n2\n                                                                                                                                                                                          \nStatement of Reasons (SOR) on November 26, 2007, detailing security concerns under \nForeign Influence.  \n  \n \nOn December 11, 2007, Applicant answered the SOR and elected to have the \nmatter decided without a hearing. Department Counsel submitted the government's \ncase in a File of Relevant Material (FORM), dated January 15, 2008. Applicant's \nresponse to the FORM was due 30 days after receipt of a copy of the FORM. A \nresponse was due on February 21, 2008. No response had been received. On March \n27, 2008, I was assigned the case.  \n \nProcedural and Evidentiary Rulings \n \n \nWithin the FORM, Department Counsel submitted a formal request that I take \nadministrative notice of certain facts relating to Hong Kong and the People's Republic of \nChina (PRC), along with nine attachments. The facts administratively noticed are limited \nto matters of general knowledge and matters not subject to reasonable dispute. Those \nfacts are set out in the Findings of Facts, below. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted the factual allegations, with \nexplanations, for \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.f.  \n \n \nApplicant is a 28-year-old intern who has worked for a defense contractor since \nJanuary 2002, and is seeking to obtain a security clearance.  \n \n \nApplicant was born in Hong Kong. In 1993, he\u2014then age 13\u2014moved to the U.S. \nwith his mother and sister. While living in Hong Kong, Hong Kong was a colony of the \nUnited Kingdom. In 1997, it reverted to China. Since being in the U.S., Applicant \nattended middle school, high school, and obtained degrees in computer engineering \nand piano. In December 2004, he became a U.S. citizen. (Item 4) He has no foreign \ninterests, assets, or property in Hong Kong. He surrendered his Hong Kong/United \nKingdom passport and is willing to renounce his Hong Kong citizenship. (Item 3) In \nAugust 2007, Applicant appeared at this company\u2019s security office and presented his \nUnited Kingdom passport for destruction. (Item 5) The passport had expired in April \n2007.  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s mother is a dual citizen of the United States and Hong Kong. In 1993, \nshe moved to the U.S. and became a U.S. citizen in 1999. She currently is a pastry \nchief residing in the U.S. She has never worked for the government of Hong Kong or \nChina. His mother owns a home in the U.S. When Applicant\u2019s father died, his \u201cmother \nexperience a lot of paper works\u201d to obtain access to his father\u2019s bank account. (Item 3) \nHis mother determined it was better for her to have a joint bank account with Applicant \nto avoid difficulty on her death. The account has approximately $48,000 in it. (Item 5) \n \npromulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for \nSORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n\n \n \n \n3\nApplicant believes the money is his mother\u2019s money and he has no entitlement to it until \nher death. His assets in the U.S. are worth approximately $36,000. (Item 5)  \n \nApplicant\u2019s sister is also dual citizen of the United States and Hong Kong. In \n1993, she\u2014then age 10\u2014moved to the U.S. and became a U.S. citizen in 1999. She \nattended middle school, high school, and college in the U.S. She owns a restaurant. In \n1987, Applicant\u2019s little sister born was born in the U.S. (Item 4) \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s fianc\u00e9e, a nurse, is a citizen of Hong Kong. She is a legal resident of \nthe U.S. and has lived in the U.S. since 2000. In 2007, they purchased a home together \nin the U.S.  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s uncle and grandmother are citizens and residents of Hong Kong and \nneither have ever been employed by the government of Hong Kong or China. The only \ntime he talks with them is when he is at his mother\u2019s and she calls them. Calls are \nnormally made at holidays such as New Year\u2019s Day and Christmas. The calls routinely \nconsist of greetings and checking on health. His uncle was never employed by the \ngovernment of China or Hong Kong. His relationship with his uncle, his father\u2019s brother, \nhas become more distant following his father\u2019s death.  \n \nHong Kong  \nI take administrative notice of the following facts. The People's Republic of China \nis an authoritarian state controlled by the Chinese Communist Party. It has a poor \nrecord of protecting human rights. Its interests are hostile to the United States. Since \n1997, Hong Kong has been a special administrative region of China, which enjoys a \nhigh degree of autonomy, except in defense and foreign affairs. Hong Kong remains a \nfree society, and its citizens have rights protected by law. The government of Hong \nKong generally respects the human rights of its residents. The possibility exists that the \ngovernment would attempt to exploit or pressure its residents to act adversely to the \ninterests of the United States, but the risk is not as great as in the PRC. \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s over-arching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \n\n \n \n \n4\nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nas to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nForeign Influence  \n \nForeign contacts and interests may be a security concern if the individual has \ndivided loyalties or foreign financial interests, may be manipulated or induced to help a \nforeign person, group, organization, or government in a way that is not in U.S. interests, \nor is vulnerable to pressure or coercion by any foreign interest. Adjudication under this \nguideline can and should consider the identity of the foreign country in which the foreign \ncontact or financial interest is located, including, but not limited to, such considerations \nas whether the foreign country is known to target United States citizens to obtain \nprotected information and/or is associated with a risk of terrorism. (AG & 6) \n \nApplicant\u2019s uncle and grandmother are citizens and residents of Hong Kong. His \nmother, who he maintains a joint bank account with, and sister are dual U.S. and Hong \nKong citizens living in the U.S. His fianc\u00e9e is a citizen of Hong Kong and legal resident \n\n \n \n \n5\nof the U.S. Having considered all of the Foreign Influence disqualifying conditions, \napplicable conditions that could raise a security concern are AG & 7(a) \u201ccontact with a \nforeign family member, business or professional associate, friend, or other person who \nis a citizen of or resident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of \nforeign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion\u201d and AG & 7(b) \n\u201cconnections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that create a potential \nconflict of interest between the individual=s obligation to protect sensitive information or \ntechnology and the individual=s desire to help a foreign person, group, or country by \nproviding that information.\u201d  \n \nThe mere possession of close family ties with a person in a foreign country is not, \nas a matter of law, disqualifying under Guideline B. However, if a relative lives in a \nforeign country and an applicant has contacts with that relative, this factor alone is \nsufficient to create the potential for foreign influence and could potentially result in the \ncompromise of classified information. See ISCR Case No. 03-02382 at 5 (App. Bd. \nFeb.15, 2006); ISCR Case No. 99-0424 (App. Bd. Feb. 8, 2001). \n \nA family connection can create a potential conflict of interest when the \nrelationships are sufficiently close in nature to raise a security concern over one\u2019s desire \nto help their family. In assessing whether relatives are vulnerable to exploitation, it is \nhelpful to consider several factors, including the character of the government of the \nrelevant foreign country. The PRC is an authoritarian state controlled by the Chinese \nCommunist Party with a poor record of protecting human rights. Its interests are hostile \nto the United States. The government of Hong Kong generally respects the human \nrights of its residents. Since 1997, Hong Kong has been a special administrative region \nof China, which enjoys a high degree of autonomy, except in defense and foreign \naffairs. Hong Kong remains a free society, and its citizens have rights protected by law. \nThe possibility exists that the government would attempt to exploit or pressure its \nresidents to act adversely to the interests of the United States, but the risk is not as \ngreat as in the PRC. \n \nIn every case where relatives live overseas, there is a risk of pressure on this \nrelative and through them upon the holder of a security clearance. Under the facts of \nthis case, a heightened risk for exploitation, inducement, manipulation pressure, or \ncoercion is not substantiated. Applicant has lived in the U.S. since 1993, when he was \n13. His grandmother and uncle live in Hong Kong. However, since his father\u2019s death, \nApplicant\u2019s relationship with his uncle has become distant. His contact with these two \nrelatives consists of calls made at holidays when his mother initiates the calls. The calls \nare short and restricted to greetings and exchanges about health. \n \nApplicant has mitigated the concern over his grandmother\u2019s and uncle\u2019s \nresidence in Hong Kong. Under MC & 8(b) \u201cthere is no conflict of interest, either \nbecause the individual=s sense of loyalty or obligation to the foreign person, group, \ngovernment, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such deep and longstanding \nrelationships and loyalties in the U.S., that the individual can be expected to resolve any \nconflict of interest in favor of the U.S. interest.\u201d Neither relative is in a position \nconnected with the Chinese government or engaged in activities that would likely cause \n\n \n \n \n6\nApplicant to be exploited or placed in a position of having to choose between them and \nthe U.S. His contacts with these two relatives appear to be infrequent and so casual as \nnot to create a risk of foreign influence.  \n \nApplicant has not lived in Hong Kong since 1993. Applicant=s ties to Hong Kong \nhave become minimal over the years. His ties with the U.S. are much stronger than his \nties with Hong Kong.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s closer relatives, his mother and sisters, and his fianc\u00e9e all live in the \nU.S. His mother and sisters are U.S. citizens. His youngest sister was born in the U.S. \nand has lived nowhere other than the U.S. His other sister and mother are naturalized \nU.S. citizens. His mother and sister have solid connections with the U.S. His sister \nobtained her education in the U.S. and works in the U.S. His mother\u2019s job and home are \nin the U.S. Applicant and his mother have a joint account, but he sees the money as his \nmother\u2019s until she dies. Currently, he feels no entitlement to the money. It is speculative \nwhether there will be any money in the account upon his mother\u2019s death. Applicant lives \nwith his fianc\u00e9e in a home they purchased together in the U.S. His fianc\u00e9e is a legal \nresident of the U.S. who has lived in the U.S. since 2000, but is a citizen of Hong Kong.  \n \nNone of Applicant\u2019s relatives have ever worked for the Chinese or Hong Kong \ngovernment. There is no evidence any of them are involved with organizations which \nseek to harm the U.S.  \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \nProtection of our national security is of paramount concern. Security clearance \ndecisions are not intended to assign guilt or to impose further punishment for past \ntransgressions. Rather, the objective of the adjudicative process is the fair-minded, \ncommonsense assessment of a person=s trustworthiness and fitness for access to \nclassified information. In reaching this decision, I have considered the whole person \nconcept in evaluating Applicant=s risk and vulnerability in protecting our national \ninterests. I considered the totality of Applicant\u2019s family ties to Hong Kong and the PRC \nand the heavy burden an Applicant carries when he has family members in the PRC.  \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \nthe nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances \nsurrounding \nthe \nconduct, \nto \ninclude \nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency \nof the conduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the \ntime of the conduct; (5) extent to which participation is \nvoluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and \nother permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for \nthe conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, \n\n \n \n \n7\nexploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation \nor recurrence.  \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept. \n \nWhile certain danger exists for all living in Hong Kong, Applicant\u2019s grandmother \nand uncle are in no greater danger than any other individual living and working in Hong \nKong. Applicant is a mature person. He has lived in the U.S. for 15 years, and has been \na naturalized citizen for three. Applicant\u2019s fianc\u00e9e has been living in the U.S. since 2000 \nand is a legal resident. Applicant completed middle school and high school in the U.S. \nand earned his degree from U.S. institutions. His ties to the U.S. are much stronger than \nhis ties to two relatives living in Hong Kong. There is no evidence he has ever taken any \naction that could cause potential harm to the U.S. After taking his U.S. oath of \ncitizenship he surrendered his UK/Hong Kong passport, which subsequently expired.  \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant mitigated the foreign influence security concerns. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline B:  \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a \u2013 1.f: \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

O\u2019Brien, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro Se\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nLYNCH, Noreen A., Administrative Judge:\nApplicant submitted his Security Clearance Application (SF 86), on October 17,\n2005. On October 18, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA)\nissued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns under Guideline F\nfor Applicant. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding\nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of\nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review\nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative\nguidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective\nwithin the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n \nApplicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on November 13, 2007, and\nrequested a hearing before an Administrative Judge. DOHA received the request on\nJanuary 17, 2008, and I received the case assignment on January 17, 2008. DOHA\nissued a notice of hearing on January 28, 2008, and I convened the hearing as\nscheduled on February 15, 2008. The government offered Exhibits (Ex.) 1 through 4\nwhich were received without objection. Applicant testified on his own behalf and\nMarch 6, 2008\n\nApplicant\u2019s answer, dated November 13, 2007.\n1\nGE 1(Security Clearance Questionnaire, dated October 17, 2005).\n2\nApplicant\u2019s second wife was abusive to his three children from his former marriage. Applicant did not want\n3\nthem in the home with his second wife.\nGE 2 (Answer to interrogatories, dated August 28, 2007).\n4\n2\nsubmitted Exhibits A through D, without objection. He also presented the testimony of\none witness. At Applicant\u2019s request, I kept the record open until February 25, 2008.\nApplicant timely submitted a document that I marked as Exhibit E. Department Counsel\nhad no objection to the submission. DOHA received the transcript of the hearing (Tr.)\nOn February 26, 2008. Based upon a review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and\ntestimony, eligibility for access to classified information is granted.\nFindings of Fact\nIn his Answer to the SOR, dated November 13, 2007, Applicant admitted the\nfactual allegations in \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.d, of the SOR, with explanations.  He provided additional\n1\ninformation to support his request for eligibility for a security clearance. \nApplicant is a 53-year-old employee of a defense contractor. Applicant served on\nactive duty in the U.S. Navy from 1979 until 1999. He received a top-secret security\nclearance while he was on active duty in the Navy. He retired as an officer (O-5\nCommander) from the Navy in 1999.  He has not held a clearance for the last few\n2\nyears.\nApplicant\u2019s first marriage ended in divorce in 1991. He has four children from that\nmarriage. In 1994, Applicant remarried. He has one son as a result of that marriage. He\nand his second wife separated in 2002. Applicant\u2019s second wife refused to work during\nthe marriage. When Applicant retired his income was less. He and his second wife\ncould not pay all their bills. They had three mortgages on the family home which was\neventually foreclosed. He also had boarding school bills for three children.  Applicant\n3\nfiled for Chapter 13 Bankruptcy in May 2001, because he wanted to pay all his\ncreditors.  \n4\nAfter Applicant retired from the Navy, he worked in the financial services industry.\nHis work did not succeed as a result of the impact of September 2001. He took various\njobs but they were low paying.  He was also supporting his children and his estranged\nwife and paying the mortgage on the family home. The pastor of his church gave him\ntemporary living quarters until he could find a place to live in 2002.\nIn 2003, Applicant\u2019s second wife filed an order for support. Applicant could not\nafford an attorney to represent him. The amount of court ordered support and mortgage\npayment totaled 100% of Applicant\u2019s income according to Applicant. During that time\nApplicant worked many jobs. He worked as a teacher and a janitor at night. He worked\n\nId.\n5\nGE 3 (Credit Bureau Report for Applicant).\n6\nAE D (Order of Child Support withholding).\n7\n Tr. 40.\n8\n3\nduring the summer in construction work. However, he continued to pay under the\nbankruptcy plan. The bankruptcy was discharged in 2004. At the same time, he could\nbarely afford all his living expenses. He fell behind in the support payments. Applicant\u2019s\nvery contentious separation has lasted for five years. During this time, Applicant has\npaid all that he could to the state for child support and spouse support. Applicant has\nbeen paying into a state account for spouse/child support steadily since February 2003.\nThis order required Applicant to pay approximately $1,869 a month. He has asked the\nlocal department to provide him with a history of his payments. He received the printout\nbut it has one account number. It is not clear how the money has been allotted.  \n5\n. \nIn 2005, Applicant began his current employment with a contractor. His salary\nfluctuated but he earned a steady income. His salary ranged from $80,200 in the first\nyear to $52,000 in 2007. This was the result of different work under different contracts.  \nIn August 2007,an amended order for child support was issued. Applicant has\n$450 a month deducted from his civilian pay. His Navy retirement pay ($3,266 a month\ngross) has an allotment of $1,417 for the spousal/child support account. The account\nbalance has been steadily decreasing. Applicant\u2019s balance as of February 8, 2008 is\n$12,642.98. The balance on May 30, 2006 was $17,584. Thus, Applicant has paid\nalmost $5,000 in arrearage in the past 18 months. \nApplicant petitioned for Chapter 13 bankruptcy in May 2001. His delinquent debts\nwere discharged in bankruptcy after his three years of payments in October 2004 (\u00b6\n1.a).The SOR alleges additional debt in the total amount of approximately $19,000.  \n6\nAllegation \u00b6 1.b in the amount of $14,321 is for an account past due for spouse\nsupport to the state. However, Applicant has provided documentation that he has been\npaying through garnishment or allotment (at his request) an amount since the 2003\ncourt order.  \n7\nAllegation \u00b6 1.c is a civil judgment for $900. This is the result of Applicant\u2019s\nsecond wife living in the home after their separation. Applicant was negotiating with her\nover this debt.  He did not learn of this judgment until several months after it occurred.\nHowever, it is still unpaid. He will pay it if she does not.8\nAllegation \u00b6 1.d in the amount of $4,236 is for state income tax (2001). This\noccurred during the marital separation. Applicant acknowledges the tax debt is not paid.\n\nAE E.\n9\nAE A (Letter from  LCDR US Navy (Ret).\n10\n4\nHe is increasing his monthly tax withholding by $100 beginning in March 2008.   It is not\n9\nclear how this will affect the tax debt. However, he plans to repay the taxes with the\nmoney that will result from lower support payments.    \nApplicant\u2019s current monthly net income is approximately $2,250 (this amount is\nthe remainder after the garnishment and allotment payments). After monthly deductions\nand expenses, he has a net remainder of $275. \nApplicant has not received any financial counseling. However, he has a\ngarnishment of $1,417 a month which goes toward the spousal/child support account to\nthe state. He even called the contact person at the state to see if he could pay more into\nthe account. \nApplicant\u2019s fellow Navy aviation officer has maintained a 30-year friendship with\nApplicant. He recommends Applicant highly. He believes that Applicant\u2019s financial\ndifficulties stem from his failed marriage and not from any character defect. He\ncommends Applicant as honest, trustworthy, loyal, extremely reliable and with\nunquestionable personal character.  \n10\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2,\nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the\n\u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available, reliable\ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a\ndecision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\n\n5\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of\nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \nAnalysis\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set\nout in AG & 18:      \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to\nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended\nis at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under\nAG & 19(a), an Ainability or unwillingness to satisfy debts@ is potentially disqualifying.\nSimilarly under AG & 19(c), Aa history of not meeting financial obligations@ may raise\nsecurity concerns. Applicant accumulated delinquent debt and was unable to pay some\nobligations for a period of time. He petitioned for Chapter 13 bankruptcy in 2001. The\nevidence is sufficient to raise these potentially disqualifying conditions, requiring a closer\nexamination.\nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security\nconcerns arising from financial difficulties. Under AG \u00b6 20(a), the disqualifying condition\n\n6\nmay be mitigated where Athe behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or\noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt\non the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.@ Applicant=s\nfinancial worries arose before 2001. He accumulated some delinquent debt due to his\nretirement from the military, his wife\u2019s refusal to work and his lower income in the civilian\nworld. His separation in 2002 exacerbated his debt problems. While the separation,\npending divorce, and underemployment may have precipitated the debt, the inquiry\ndoes not end at that point. The Applicant\u2019s problems have been ongoing and he has not\nresolved his tax debt. He has been active in paying his child/spousal support despite an\narrearage. He has been paying since the 2003 court order. His actions after being\ngainfully employed do not raise concerns about his current reliability, trustworthiness, or\ngood judgment. This potentially mitigating condition applies in part. \nUnder AG & 20(b), it may be mitigating where Athe conditions that resulted in the\nfinancial problem were largely beyond the person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a\nbusiness downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation),\nand the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances.@ As noted above, the\nfinancial problems arose from his separation, retirement, lower earnings and court\norder. He acted responsibly by working two jobs at a time and living modestly during his\nunderemployment. I find this potentially mitigating condition is a factor for consideration\nin this case. \nEvidence that Athe person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem\nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control@\nis potentially mitigating under AG & 20(c). Similarly, AG & 20(d) applies where the\nevidence shows Athe individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or\notherwise resolve debts.@ Applicant has not received counseling and has not resolved\nthe delinquent 2001 tax debt. However, he filed bankruptcy and paid his creditors under\nthe plan until 2004 when the bankruptcy was discharged. He has been paying by\ngarnishment or allotment under the court order to the state for child/spousal support. He\nis now in a financially sound situation. He will begin to pay his 2001 tax debt now that he\nhas more income. I conclude these potentially mitigating conditions apply in part.\nAG \u00b6 20(e) applies where the evidence shows \u201cthe individual has a reasonable\nbasis to dispute the legitimacy of the past due debt which is the cause of the problem\nand provides documented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides\nevidence of actions to resolve the issue.\u201d In this case, Applicant\u2019s second wife caused\nthe $900 judgment. He has not paid the amount because he was negotiating with her to\ndo so. He will pay the judgment if she does not. I conclude this potentially mitigating\ncondition applies in part.\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine\n\n7\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness\nof the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include\nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which participation\nis voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent\nbehavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure,\ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d\nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security\nclearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful\nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.       \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case.  Applicant served in the U.S. Navy\nfor 20 years and retired as an officer. He held a top secret clearance during that time.\nHe has an excellent recommendation from a retired navy officer who knew Applicant.\nGranted, he filed bankruptcy in 2001. However, this is a legal means of debt resolution.\nHis debts under the bankruptcy plan were discharged in 2004. His very contentious\nseparation and lower income after retirement caused his financial problems from 2002\nonward. He has been paying on his court ordered child/spousal support. He is now\nearning more money and can address his 2001 tax debt. Of course, the issue is not\nsimply whether all his debts are paidBit is whether his financial circumstances raise\nconcerns about his fitness to hold a security clearance. Applicant has addressed his\ndelinquent debts. He reported his financial information during his security investigation.\nHe has been proactive in paying his debts. He will address his 2001 tax debt within the\nyear. He has met his burden of proof in this case to overcome the government\u2019s case. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions and doubts as to\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I\nconclude Applicant has mitigated the security concerns arising from his financial\nconsiderations. \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nFor Applicant\n\n8\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is granted.\n                                              \n_________________\nNOREEN A. LYNCH\nAdministrative Judge\n",

DeLaney, Esquire, Department Counsel, \nJames Duffy, Esquire, Assistant Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro Se \n \n \n \n______________ \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \n \nRIVERA, Juan J., Administrative Judge: \n \nApplicant submitted his Security Clearance Application (eQIP)1 on July 26, 2006. \nOn August 29, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a \nStatement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the Government\u2019s security concerns under \nGuideline B (Foreign Influence).2  \n  \n \nApplicant answered the SOR on September 30, 2007, and requested a hearing \nbefore an Administrative Judge. The case was assigned to me on November 27, 2007. \nDOHA issued a notice of hearing on December 5, 2007, and I convened the hearing as \nscheduled on January 2, 2008. The government offered exhibits (GE) 1 through 4, \n \n1  Electronic Questionnaires for Investigations Processing. \n \n2  The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \nIndustry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial \nPersonnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the \nrevised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective \nwithin the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n \nJanuary 29, 2008\n\n \n2 \n \n \nwhich were received without objection. Applicant testified on his own behalf and \nsubmitted exhibit (AE) 1, which was received without objection. DOHA received the \ntranscript of the hearing (Tr.) on January 10, 2008. Based upon a review of the case file, \npleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility for access to classified information is \ngranted. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nIn his Answer to the SOR, dated September 17, 2007, Applicant admitted all \nSOR allegations with explanations. His admissions are incorporated herein as findings \nof fact. After a thorough review of all evidence of record, including his demeanor and \ntestimony, I make the following findings of fact.  \n \nApplicant is a 38-year-old software engineer. In 1992, he completed his \nbachelor\u2019s degree in computer science and electrical engineering. He received his \nmaster\u2019s degree in software engineering in May 2001 (Tr. 6). He married his wife in \nJune 1999, and they have three children, ages eight, seven, and three (GE 1). His wife \nis a registered nurse. \n \nApplicant and his wife are native-born U.S. citizens, and they have lived all their \nlives in the United States. Applicant\u2019s parents were born and raised in the Republic of \nGhana (Ghana). His father immigrated to the United States in 1962. From 1970 to 1996 \nwhen he retired, Applicant\u2019s father worked as an accountant for the Ghana embassy in \nthe United States. He became a U.S. naturalized citizen in early 1998, and passed \naway that same year (GE 2, Tr. 40). Applicant took his father\u2019s body to be buried in \nGhana. The Ghana ambassador to the United States spoke at his father\u2019s memorial \nservices (GE 2). \n \nApplicant\u2019s mother immigrated to the United States in 1964. She came to the \nUnited States with her older brother (Uncle X) to help him while he was attending \ngraduate studies at a prestigious U.S. university. She became a naturalized U.S. citizen \nin 1998 (GE 2). Applicant\u2019s mother worked as a beautician for most of her life. In 2001, \nshe stopped working as a beautician to take care of Applicant\u2019s children. She moved in \nwith Applicant in 2007 to facilitate her taking car of Applicant\u2019s children (Tr. 37-40). \n \nIn addition to his mother, Applicant has a maternal aunt living with him. His aunt \nis a citizen of Ghana who immigrated to the United States in 1978 (Tr. 50). She has not \napplied for U.S. citizenship. Applicant\u2019s aunt is currently unemployed. She worked for a \nchild care facility until 2007. Applicant\u2019s aunt has a 38-year-old son, born in Ghana, \nliving in the United States (Tr. 51-52). Applicant\u2019s cousin immigrated to the United \nStates in the 1990\u2019s, and works in another state. Applicant\u2019s contact with his cousin is \nlimited to brief telephone calls during the holidays, and he has little knowledge of his \ncousin\u2019s personal life (Tr. 52).  \n \nApplicant has two other cousins, who were born in Ghana to a deceased aunt \n(mother\u2019s sister), and that live in the United States. He believes they immigrated to the \n\n \n3 \n \n \nUnited States in the late 1980s or early 1990s. Both are doctors in another state. He \nhad infrequent contact with these cousins, which was limited to occasional telephone \nconversations, usually during the holidays. He did not know whether they are \nnaturalized U.S. citizens. His last contact with them was the day before his hearing (Tr. \n53-54). \n \nApplicant has two siblings who were born and raised in the United States (Tr. \n43). They work together in their own plumbing business. He also has a paternal half-\nbrother who was born and raised in Ghana (Tr. 46-48). He became a naturalized U.S. \ncitizen in 1997. He is estranged from his half-brother \u2013 they do not talk to each other, \nand he has little knowledge of his half-brother\u2019s personal situation. \n \nApplicant has four maternal uncles and five cousins and their respective families \nthat are residents and citizens of Ghana (Tr. 85). He has infrequent contact with these \nrelatives. His mother and aunt, both of whom live with him, are the ones that maintain \nfrequent contact with their family and friends in Ghana. Applicant sends approximately \n$300 a year to support his cousin\u2019s family in Ghana (Tr. 74). \n \nApplicant traveled to Ghana in 1998 to bury his father, and in 2000 to attend his \ngrandmother\u2019s funeral. During both occasions, he stayed at Uncle X\u2019s home in Ghana \nfor approximately two weeks. He also visited with his other relatives living in Ghana \nmost of whom he met for the first time. Applicant never discusses his work with any of \nhis relatives. When asked about what he does for a living, he only tells them he works \nfor a prestigious U.S. university (Tr. 74). \n \nUncle X is an internationally renowned scientist and academician who has held \nimportant positions within the Ghana government, and is currently employed in an \nimportant government position in Ghana related to his subject matter of expertise (AE 1, \nGE 3, and GE 4). Applicant has personal contact with Uncle X approximately twice a \nyear when his uncle visits the United States. He speaks to him on the telephone \noccasionally during the holidays and other special occasions. Uncle X visited Applicant \nin the United States in 2000 and 2004. The last time Applicant talked to his Uncle X was \nin 2004 when his Uncle called to congratulate him on the birth of his son. Applicant \nstated Uncle X stayed with his brother during the 2000 and 2004 visits (Tr. 81-82). \nApplicant\u2019s mother and aunt are the ones that maintain contact with his relatives in \nGhana via telephone and letters. His contact with relatives in Ghana is occasional, and \nhe has little knowledge of which family members and friends his mother and aunt \nmaintain contact with or of the frequency of those contacts (Tr. 81, 89). \n \nFrom 1992 to 1996, Applicant worked for several defense contractors as a \nsoftware developer. During that period, he was granted access to classified information \nat the secret level. From 2007 to 2004, he held other jobs where he had no need for \naccess to classified information. In 2004, he was hired by his current employer, a \ndefense contractor, and shortly thereafter, he was granted access to classified \ninformation at the secret level. In 2006, Applicant submitted a security clearance \napplication and requested an upgrade of his access to classified information to the top \n\n \n4 \n \n \n                                                          \nsecret level (GE 1). There is no evidence that Applicant has ever compromised \nclassified information or that he has failed to comply with rules and regulations \nconcerning the protection of classified information. \n \nApplicant has had a good record working for defense contractors providing \nsupport to the military in high visibility projects. There is no evidence to dispute his \ncontention that he is a valued employee with good work performance. \n \nI take administrative notice of the following facts. Ghana has a democratic \ngovernment with a close relationship to the United States. Its elections are generally \nacknowledged to be free and fair. Although there are some areas of concern, the \ngovernment generally respects human rights, and continues to take significant steps to \nimprove the protection of human rights. The U.S. and Ghanaian militaries have \ncooperated in numerous joint training exercises. The United States is among Ghana\u2019s \nprincipal trading partners and has provided Ghana substantial monetary development \nassistance.  \n \nPolicies \n \n \nThe purpose of a security clearance decision is to resolve whether it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue an applicant\u2019s eligibility for \naccess to classified information.3 \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s controlling \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d4 In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \n \n3  See Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988). \n \n4  Egan, supra, at 528, 531. \n\n \n5 \n \n \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline B, Foreign Influence \n \n  \nUnder Guideline B, the government\u2019s concern is that foreign contacts and \ninterests may be a security concern if the individual has divided loyalties or foreign \nfinancial interests, he or she may be manipulated or induced to help a foreign person, \ngroup, organization, or government in a way that is not in U.S. interests, or is vulnerable \nto pressure or coercion by any foreign interest. Adjudication under this Guideline can \nand should consider the identity of the foreign country in which the foreign contact or \nfinancial interest is located, including, but not limited to, such considerations as whether \nthe foreign country is known to target United States citizens to obtain protected \ninformation and/or is associated with a risk of terrorism. AG \u00b6 6. \n \nAG \u00b6 7 sets out nine conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. Three disqualifying conditions are particularly relevant to this case: \n \n(a) contact with a foreign family member, business or professional \nassociate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or resident in a \nforeign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of foreign \nexploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; \n\n \n6 \n \n \n                                                          \n \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual\u2019s obligation to \nprotect sensitive information or technology and the individual\u2019s desire to \nhelp a foreign person, group, or country by providing that information; and, \n \n(d) sharing living quarters with a person or persons, regardless of \ncitizenship status, if that relationship creates a heightened risk of foreign \ninducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion.  \n \nThe mere possession of close family ties with a person in a foreign country is not, \nas a matter of law, disqualifying under Guideline B. However, if only one relative lives in \na foreign country, and an applicant has contacts with that relative, this factor alone is \nsufficient to create the potential for foreign influence and could potentially result in the \ncompromise of classified information.5  \n \nApplicant has an Aunt who is a citizen of Ghana living with him. She and his \nmother, who also lives with him, have frequent contacts and a close relationship of \naffection and/or obligation with many of his relatives who are citizens and residents of \nGhana. Applicant has occasional contact with his Uncle X, as well as with some of his \nmany relatives who are residents and citizens of Ghana. These contacts potentially \ncreate a risk of foreign pressure or attempted exploitation because there is the \npossibility that Ghanaian government agents may exploit the opportunity to obtain \nintelligence, classified, or economic information about the United States.  \n \nHis connection to his family members in Ghana \u2013 personally and/or through his \nmother and aunt -- also create a potential conflict of interest because his relationships \nare sufficiently close to raise a security concern about his desire to help them or the \ngovernment of Ghana by providing sensitive or classified information.  \n \n  \nThe Government produced substantial evidence raising these three potentially \ndisqualifying conditions, and the burden shifted to Applicant to produce evidence and \nprove a mitigating condition. The burden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts \nto the Government. \n \n  \nThree of the four Foreign Influence Mitigating Conditions under AG \u00b6 8 are \npotentially applicable to these disqualifying conditions: \n \n(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in \nwhich these persons are located, or the positions or activities of those \npersons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be \nplaced in a position of having to choose between the interests of a foreign \n \n5  See ISCR Case No. 03-02382 at 5 (App. Bd. Feb. 15, 2006); ISCR Case No. 99-0424 (App. \nBd. Feb. 8, 2001). \n \n\n \n7 \n \n \n                                                          \nindividual, group, organization, or government and the interests of the \nU.S.; \n \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of \nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, group, government, or country is \nso minimal, or the individual has such deep and longstanding relationships \nand loyalties in the U.S., that the individual can be expected to resolve any \nconflict of interest in favor of the U.S. interest; and, \n \n(c) contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and \ninfrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign \ninfluence or exploitation. \n \nAfter considering the totality of the facts and circumstances in Applicant\u2019s case, I \nconclude that AG \u00b6\u00b6 8(a) and (c) partially apply, and AG \u00b6 8(b) fully applies. Applicant \nwas born, raised, and educated in the United States. His wife and children are native-\nborn Americans. He has no financial, business, or property interests in Ghana. He has \nbeen to Ghana twice in his life, to attend his grandmother\u2019s and father\u2019s funerals \nApplicant credibly testified he has only occasional contact with Uncle X, and some of his \ncousins and their family who are residents and citizens of Ghana. Applicant has \ndeveloped a sufficient relationship and loyalty to the United States that he can be \nexpected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the United States\u2019 interest. \n \nApplicant has strong feelings of affection and a strong sense of obligation to his \nmother and his aunt, as shown by the fact that they live with him and care for his \nchildren. His mother and aunt have a close relationship and frequent contact with Uncle \nX and other relatives and friends who are citizens and residents of Ghana.  \n \n \nIn deciding whether Applicant\u2019s family members are in a position to be exploited, \nI considered Ghana\u2019s form of government.6 Ghana is a democratic republic with a \nfriendly relationship with the United States. Its elections are generally acknowledged to \nbe free and fair. The Ghanaian government generally respects human rights, and has \nrecently taken steps to improve the protection of human rights. The U.S. and Ghanaian \nmilitaries have cooperated in joint training exercises. The United States is among \nGhana\u2019s principal trading partners and has provided Ghana substantial development \nassistance. There is no evidence to show Ghana has an intelligence, industrial, or \neconomic organization that engages in espionage against the United States. \n \nConsidering the totality of the circumstances, the evidence shows it is unlikely \nApplicant will be placed in a position of having to choose between the interests of his \nfamily and the interests of the United States. He personally has limited contact with his \n \n \n6  The focus of the analysis is primarily on its rulers and the nature of the government they \nimpose. This approach recognizes that it makes sense to treat each country in accordance with the level \nof security concern or threat it presents to the United States. Terrorism and crime are also factors to be \nconsidered.  \n \n\n \n8 \n \n \nrelatives in Ghana. Because of Applicant\u2019s rearing in the United States, as well as that \nof his wife and children, I believe Applicant would resolve any possible conflict of \ninterest in favor of the United States. I consider in my assessment the fact that his \nmother and aunt have contacts and close relationship with their family in Ghana. I also \nconsidered the potential exploitation or influence because of Uncle X\u2019s position in the \nGhanaian government. However, considering Ghana\u2019s history, and the favorable \neconomic and political relationship of the Ghanaian government with the United States, \nI believe there is little likelihood that his mother and aunt\u2019s relationship with his family \nand friends in Ghana could create a risk for foreign influence or exploitation. \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness \nof the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include \nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which \nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other \npermanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for \npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or \nrecurrence.\u201d Under AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility \nfor a security clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.        \n \n \nThe Appeal Board requires the whole person analysis address \u201cevidence of an \napplicant\u2019s personal loyalties; the nature and extent of an applicant\u2019s family\u2019s ties to the \nU.S. relative to his [or her] ties to a foreign country; his or her ties social ties within the \nU.S.; and many others raised by the facts of a given case.\u201d ISCR Case No. 04-00540 at \n7 (App. Bd. Jan. 5, 2007).  In that same decision, the Appeal Board commended the \nwhole person analysis in ISCR Case No. 03-02878 at 3 (App. Bd. June 7, 2006), which \nprovides: \n \nApplicant has been in the U.S for twenty years and a naturalized citizen \nfor seven.  Her husband is also a naturalized citizen, and her children are \nU.S. citizens by birth.  Her ties to these family members are stronger than \nher ties to family members in Taiwan.  She has significant financial \ninterests in the U.S. , and none in Taiwan.  She testified credibly that she \ntakes her loyalty to the U.S. very seriously and would defend the interests \nof the U.S.  Her supervisors and co-worker assess her as very loyal and \ntrustworthy.   \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant is a mature, well educated \nnative-born American citizen. From 1992 to 1996, Applicant worked for several defense \n\n \n9 \n \n \ncontractors and had access to classified information at the secret level. In 2004, he was \nhired by his current employer, another defense contractor, and has had access to \nclassified information at the secret level since then. There is no evidence that Applicant \nhas ever compromised classified information or that he has failed to comply with rules \nand regulations concerning the protection of classified information. After carefully \ncomparing Applicant\u2019s connections to the United States and Ghana, I conclude his \nconnections to the United States are much stronger. \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant mitigated the security concerns arising from his foreign preference \nsecurity concerns.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline B:  \n \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.e: \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to continue Applicant\u2019s security clearance. \nEligibility for access to classified information is granted. \n \n \n \n \n_________________ \nJUAN J.

    "full_text": "KEYWORD: Guideline F\nDIGEST: A Judge\u2019s failure to discuss a significant aspect of a case that reasonably could be\nexpected to be taken into account raises a serious question as to whether the Judge forgot that\naspect, ignored it, failed to appreciate its significance, or engaged in arbitrary or capricious\nanalysis. The $100,000 personal loan is important because of its size and nature and the fact that\nApplicant had been unable to make payments on it since November 2007 and would not be able\nto make payments at least until later in 2008. The debt is significant because Applicant cannot\nidentify what he did with the proceeds of the loan.  The money was borrowed between 2002 and\n2007. Applicant can only attribute its use to financial bleeding. There is no evidence that it has\nbeen used to satisfy the delinquencies in the SOR.  This calls into question Applicant\u2019s ability to\nlive within his means, satisfy debts, and meet  financial obligations. The record does not support\nthe Judge\u2019s application of MC 20(a).  While Applicant testified about his financial difficulties in\n2002, he did not demonstrate that the delinquencies in the SOR were from that period.  Three of\nthe delinquencies arose from his purchase of a larger home in 2005, which Applicant now says\nwas not a wise choice. The record does not support a conclusion that Applicant\u2019s debts are under\ncontrol or that he has made a good-faith effort to pay them off.  The Judge apparently gave\nconsiderable weight to Applicant\u2019s plan for paying off his debts after his wife has finished\ntraining and gets a new job.  The Board has indicated that promises to pay off delinquent debts in\nthe future are not a substitute for a track record of paying debts in a timely manner and otherwise\nacting in a financially responsible manner. The Judge\u2019s whole-person analysis fails to consider\nimportant aspects of the case that reasonably should have been addressed.  Most notably,\nApplicant borrowed more than $100,000  in personal loans from a friend between 2002 and\n2007, and cannot explain how he expended these proceeds or why he needed to borrow such a\nlarge amount.  \nCASENO: 07-08291.a1\nDATE: 08/26/2008\nDATE: August 26, 2008\nIn Re:\n)\n)\n)\n\n2\n--------\nApplicant for Security Clearance\n)\n)\n)\n)\n)\nISCR Case No. 07-08291\nAPPEAL BOARD DECISION\nAPPEARANCES\nFOR GOVERNMENT\nJulie R. Edmunds, Esq., Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro Se\nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant Applicant a security\nclearance.  On December 19, 2007, DOHA issued a statement of reasons advising Applicant of the\nbasis for that decision\u2014security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) of\nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992), as amended (Directive).  Applicant\nrequested a hearing.  On April 22, 2008, after the hearing, Administrative Judge Noreen A. Lynch\ngranted Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.  Department Counsel timely appealed pursuant\nto the Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nDepartment Counsel raises the following issues on appeal: whether the Judge\u2019s decision is\narbitrary and capricious because she failed to adequately address certain disqualifying evidence;\nwhether the Judge applied Guideline F Mitigating Conditions in a piecemeal fashion that was\nunsupported by the record evidence; and whether the Judge\u2019s whole-person analysis is unsustainable\nbecause it is unsupported by the record evidence.  Finding error, we reverse the Judge\u2019s favorable\nsecurity clearance decision. \nWhether the Record Supports the Judge\u2019s Factual Findings\nA. Facts\nThe Judge made the following relevant factual findings: Applicant married for the second\ntime in 2000.  Applicant and his wife have two children.  Applicant\u2019s wife quit her job during her\nfirst pregnancy.  The first child was born in 2002.  Applicant has experienced financial difficulties\ndue to loss of her income and to medical expenses.  Applicant was unemployed for a period of time\nin 2003.  At that time, he unsuccessfully attempted to start his own consulting business.\n\n3\nAdditionally, Applicant\u2019s wife experienced a very difficult second pregnancy and was on bed rest\nfor six months prior to the child\u2019s birth in 2004.  After the birth, his wife was not able to return to\nwork due to health problems of the child.  In 2005, Applicant and his wife sold their house and\nbought a larger one, refinancing it at a mortgage rate of 8.5%.  Applicant expected to refinance the\nhouse again at a lower interest rate in two years, but was unable to do so because he was unemployed\nfrom January 2007 until March 2007.  \nThe SOR alleged delinquent debts in the amount of $14,000.  Applicant also owes\napproximately $99,000 to a friend and is not making payments on that debt.  However, the friend\ntold Applicant that he needn\u2019t make any payments until his financial situation improved.\nAt the time of the hearing, Applicant\u2019s wife was learning a new skill. She was expected to\ngraduate in June 2008 and go back to work.  Applicant had finally been able to refinance his home\nat the reduced rate of 5.12% for three years.  With the income from his wife\u2019s expected job and\nincreased disposable income from reduced mortgage payments, Applicant has created a plan to pay\noff his debts promptly, although it will take over 15 years to pay off the personal loan. \nB. Discussion\nThe Appeal Board\u2019s review of the Judge\u2019s findings of facts is limited to determining if they\nare supported by substantial evidence\u2014\u201csuch relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept\nas adequate to support a conclusion in light of all the contrary evidence in the same record.\u201d\nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.32.1.  \u201cThis is something less than the weight of the evidence, and the possibility\nof drawing two inconsistent conclusions from the evidence does not prevent an administrative\nagency\u2019s finding from being supported by substantial evidence.\u201d  Consolo v. Federal Maritime\nComm\u2019n, 383 U.S. 607, 620 (1966).  In evaluating the Judge\u2019s findings, we are required to give\ndeference to the Judge\u2019s credibility determinations.  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1.      \nDepartment Counsel has not challenged the above facts.  However, she contends that the\nJudge failed to adequately address certain disqualifying evidence.  The Board will address that\ncontention below.\nWhether the Record Supports the Judge\u2019s Ultimate Conclusions \nA Judge is required to \u201cexamine the relevant data and articulate a satisfactory explanation\nfor\u201d the decision \u201cincluding a \u2018rational connection between the facts found and the choice made.\u2019\u201d\nMotor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass\u2019n of the United States, Inc. v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., 463 U.S. 29,\n43 (1983) (quoting Burlington Truck Lines v. United States, 371 U.S. 156, 168 (1962)).  The Appeal\nBoard may reverse the Judge\u2019s decision to grant, deny, or revoke a security clearance if it is arbitrary,\ncapricious, or contrary to law.  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.3 and \u00b6 E3.1.33.3.  \u201cThe general standard is that\na clearance may be granted only when \u2018clearly consistent with the interests of the national security.\u2019\u201d\nDep\u2019t of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). \n\n Directive \u00b6 E2.19(a):  \u201cinability or unwillingness to satisfy debts;\u201d and \u00b6 19(c):  \u201ca history of not meeting\n1\nfinancial obligations[.]\u201d \nDirective \u00b6 E2.19(e): \u201c consistent spending beyond one\u2019s means, which may be indicated by excessive\n2\nindebtedness, significant negative cash flow, high debt-to-income ratio, and/or other financial analysis[.]\u201d\n4\nIn deciding whether the Judge's rulings or conclusions are arbitrary or capricious, the Board\nwill review the Judge's decision to determine whether:  it does not examine relevant evidence; it fails\nto articulate a satisfactory explanation for its conclusions, including a rational connection between\nthe facts found and the choice made; it does not consider relevant factors; it reflects a clear error of\njudgment; it fails to consider an important aspect of the case; it offers an explanation for the decision\nthat runs contrary to the record evidence; or it is so implausible that it cannot be ascribed to a mere\ndifference of opinion.  In deciding whether the Judge's rulings or conclusions are contrary to law,\nthe Board will consider whether they are contrary to provisions of Executive Order 10865, the\nDirective, or other applicable federal law.  See ISCR Case No. 03-22861 at 2-3 (App. Bd. Jun. 2,\n2006).\nDepartment Counsel points out the Judge properly applied Disqualifying Conditions (DC)\n\u00b6\u00b6 E2.19(a) and (c) to Applicant\u2019s $14,000 in delinquent debt and his inability to satisfy that debt.1\nHowever, Department Counsel contends that the Judge\u2019s decision is arbitrary and capricious because\nshe failed to adequately address certain disqualifying evidence\u2013i.e., the personal loan in the\napproximate amount of $99,000.  The Judge mentioned the debt (Decision at 4 and 7), but failed to\naddress its significance.  Department Counsel contends that the personal loan also raises DC \u00b6\nE2.19(e).   Department Counsel\u2019s contention has merit. \n2\nWhile there is a rebuttable presumption that a Judge has considered all the record evidence,\na Judge\u2019s failure to discuss or even mention a significant aspect of a case that reasonably could be\nexpected to be taken into account in a decision raises a serious question as to whether the Judge\nforgot that aspect, ignored it, failed to take it into account, failed to appreciate its significance, or\nengaged in arbitrary or capricious analysis.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 02-00318 at 7-8 (App. Bd. Feb.\n25, 2004).  In this case, the personal loan is important because of its size and nature and the fact that\nas of the time of the hearing in April 2008, Applicant had been unable to make payments on it since\nNovember 2007 and would not be able to make payments until his wife graduated from her training\nand obtained a job as Applicant expected later in 2008.  However, the debt is more significant\nbecause Applicant cannot identify what he did with the proceeds of the loan.  The money was\nborrowed over time\u2013between 2002 and 2007, and Applicant can only attribute its use to \u201cfinancial\nbleeding.\u201d  Transcript at 159.  There is no record evidence that it has been used to satisfy the\ndelinquencies in the SOR.  This calls into question Applicant\u2019s ability to live within his means,\nsatisfy debts, and meet  financial obligations.  Directive \u00b6 E18 (Financial Considerations Concern).\nDepartment Counsel also argues that the Judge applied Mitigating Conditions (MC) in a\npiecemeal fashion that was unsupported by the record evidence.  In her decision, the Judge applied\n\nDirective \u00b6 E2.20(a): \u201cthe behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such\n3\ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness,\nor good judgment[.]\u201d\nDirective \u00b6 E2.20(b): \u201cthe conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s\n4\ncontrol (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or\nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances[.]\u201d\nDirective \u00b6 E2.20(c): \u201cthe person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or there are clear\n5\nindications that the problem is being resolved or is under control[.]\u201d\nDirective \u00b6 E2.20(d): \u201cthe individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise\n6\nresolve debts[.]\u201d\n5\nMitigating Conditions (MC) 20(a),  20(b),  20(c),  and 20(d)  at least in part and therefore found in\n3\n4\n5\n6\nApplicant\u2019s favor as to all the SOR allegations.  In applying MC 20(a), the Judge stated that\nApplicant\u2019s financial problems arose in 2002 due his wife\u2019s pregnancy and unemployment and his\nson\u2019s medical bills, and she concluded that \u201cthe circumstances that occurred do not raise concerns\nabout his current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.\u201d  Decision at 7.  The record does not\nsupport the Judge\u2019s application of MC 20(a).  While Applicant testified about his financial\ndifficulties in 2002, he did not demonstrate that the delinquencies in the SOR were from that period.\nThree of the delinquencies arose from his purchase of a larger home in 2005, which Applicant now\nsays was not a wise choice.  Transcript at 87.  (Those three are SOR \u00b6 1(b), an equity line of credit;\n\u00b61(e), the primary mortgage; and \u00b6 1(f), tree work on the new property.)  Applicant had already\nexperienced the loss of his wife\u2019s income and the birth of his young sons by 2005.  Applicant\u2019s child\nsupport arrearage for his son from his prior marriage began to accrue when Applicant was\nunemployed from January until March 2007, but continued until the son graduated from high school\nthree months later.  Moreover, the personal loan accrued in increments from 2002 until 2007, and\nApplicant\u2019s inability to account for his use of the proceeds of the loan casts doubt on his \u201ccurrent\nreliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment.\u201d    \nApplication of MC 20(b) requires both that the financial difficulties occurred due to\ncircumstances beyond the individual\u2019s control and that the individual acted responsibly under the\ncircumstances.  Here again, the Judge relied on circumstances beyond Applicant\u2019s control--such as\nhis periods of unemployment, the failure of his consulting business, his children\u2019s medical expenses,\nhis wife\u2019s unemployment, etc.  As discussed above, Applicant did not demonstrate that his current\nfinancial problems are directly connected to two brief periods of unemployment and the other\ncircumstances listed above.  Furthermore, the periods of unemployment Applicant experienced are\nnot different from what an average person might expect to encounter during the course of a lifetime,\nand there is no evidence that the medical expenses accounted for a major portion of his financial\ndifficulties.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 06-23362 at 4 (App. Bd. Apr. 4, 2008).  Since  the difficulties\nappear to be more closely connected to his purchase of a larger home in 2005 under terms he could\nnot afford, it does not appear that Applicant acted responsibly in the aftermath of the loss of his\nwife\u2019s income, medical expenses, etc.\n\n6\nThe Judge discussed mitigation under MC \u00b6\u00b6 20(c) and 20(d) together, concluding that\nApplicant\u2019s financial difficulties are now under control and that he has made a good-faith effort to\nrepay his delinquencies.  Decision at 7.  The record evidence does not support the Judge\u2019s\nconclusions.  The only two delinquencies that had been paid at the time of the hearing were the child\nsupport arrearage and the primary mortgage.  The child support arrearage was paid by a partial\nwithholding of Applicant\u2019s income tax refund, and the mortgage delinquency was folded into his\nmortgage when it was refinanced.  Applicant was still delinquent on the equity line of credit, was\nmaking only minimal payments ($50 to $100 instead of $375 per month) toward the tree service\ndebt, and was not making any payments on a state tax debt, the balance on a computer, or the large\npersonal loan.  The record does not support a conclusion that Applicant\u2019s debts are under control or\nthat he has made a good-faith effort to pay them off.  The Judge apparently gave considerable weight\nto Applicant\u2019s plan for paying off his debts after his wife has finished training and gets a new job.\nThe Board has indicated that promises to pay off delinquent debts in the future are not a substitute\nfor a track record of paying debts in a timely manner and otherwise acting in a financially responsible\nmanner.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 99-0012 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 1, 1999).\nFinally, Department Counsel argues that the Judge\u2019s whole-person analysis is unsustainable\nbecause it is unsupported by the totality of the record evidence.  Department Counsel\u2019s argument has\nmerit.  In her whole-person analysis, the Judge focused on positive aspects of Applicant\u2019s life\nhistory\u2013the fact that he served in the United States Air Force with a security clearance, developed\na career in a technical field, is praised for his work and integrity, cared for his son after he and his\nfirst wife separated, and spent large sums in a legal battle for custody of his son.  Decision at 8.  She\nalso relied on the factors which she considered to be beyond Applicant\u2019s control\u2013his second wife\u2019s\ndifficult pregnancies and unemployment, the medical problems of his youngest son, the poor\neconomy, his unemployment, and his problems with refinancing his house.  Id.  Finally, the Judge\nnoted Applicant\u2019s increased income and his plan to pay off his debts with increased family income\nwhen his wife returns to work.  Id.\nHowever, the Judge\u2019s whole-person analysis fails to consider important aspects of the case\nthat reasonably should have been addressed.  Most notably, Applicant borrowed more than $100,000\nin personal loans from a friend between 2002 and 2007, and cannot explain how he expended these\nproceeds or why he needed to borrow such a large amount.  Transcript at 159-161.  As explained\nabove, the Judge merely notes that Applicant used the money for \u201cvarious things.\u201d  Decision at 4.\nShe found Applicant not to be delinquent on repayment because the friend did not expect further\nrepayment until Applicant\u2019s wife returns to work.  Id. at 7.  The Judge never addressed clearly\nsignificant issues such as the large outstanding amount of the debt (over $99,000), why it was\nincurred, or Applicant\u2019s inability to explain how he expended the proceeds.  The Judge also failed\nto analyze other conduct of serious security significance.  For example, Applicant still is not paying\nother debts in a timely manner. One debt involving support payments that was repaid was satisfied\nnot by voluntary payment, but by involuntary collection through the IRS.  Transcript at 141-142;\nApplicant Exhibit A.  Applicant was able to satisfy past due amounts on his basic mortgage loan only\nafter he recently negotiated a lower interest rate, but the Judge did not discuss the obvious issue of\nApplicant\u2019s lack of self-control and good judgment in buying a larger home and incurring\nsignificantly more debt in 2005 after he had already incurred considerable debts during the years\n\n7\nimmediately preceding this purchase.  A reasonable whole-person analysis would have considered\nthese aspects of the case and other conduct of security significance along with the positive evidence\nnoted by the Judge. The Judge did not reasonably analyze this negative conduct against the whole-\nperson factors in Directive \u00b6 E2.2(a), and her whole person analysis is not sustainable.   \n \n \nOrder\nThe Judge\u2019s favorable security clearance decision is REVERSED. \nSigned: Michael D. Hipple      \nMichael D. Hipple\nAdministrative Judge\nMember, Appeal Board\nSigned: Jean E. Smallin       \nJean E. Smallin\nAdministrative Judge\nMember, Appeal Board\nCONCURRING OPINION OF ADMINISTRATIVE JUDGE JAMES E. MOODY\nI agree with my colleagues\u2019 analysis of this case.  In my opinion the most significant factor\nis the private loan which Applicant received from his friend.  I note record evidence that Applicant\nreceived this money incrementally over a five year period and that the total amount of the loans\nexceeded $100,000, though Applicant was not certain as to the exact amount.  \u201cQ: So . . . it was\nabout $100,000?  A: No.  I would have to say it was probably a little more than that because there\nwas a stretch that after he had loaned me like the first $5,000 or $10,000, I was making consistent\npayments . . . It\u2019s probably been a little more than $100,000.\u201d   Transcript at 161.  I also note\nApplicant\u2019s  apparent inability to state what he did with the money.  \u201cIt was used over the years.  I\nknow back in August\u2013I\u2019m trying to remember how much he [loaned] me back in August . . . It\u2019s been\nhere and there.  It\u2019s been so many, I don\u2019t remember every little thing.  It\u2019s\u2013it\u2019s been consumed.\u201d\nTranscript at 159.  Furthermore, there is scant record evidence about the person who loaned\nApplicant the money, except that he is a friend, former co-worker, and a millionaire.  Transcript at\n155-156.  I have considered these matters in light of the record and have taken particular note of the\nfact that Applicant\u2019s has suspended his repayment efforts on this loan.   See Decision at 4.  I\nconclude that Applicant has failed to demonstrate (1) that the facts underlying these loans do not\nimpugn his judgment; (2) that he has acted responsibly in regard to them; or (3) that he is resolving\nthe loans or engaging in a good-faith effort to repay.   Viewed in light of the entire record, I concur\nthat Applicant has failed to meet his burden of persuasion under the Egan standard.  \n\n8\nSigned: James E. Moody    \nJames E.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact In his Answer to the SOR, dated February 11, 2008, Applicant admitted the factual allegations in \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.I of the SOR, with explanations. He provided additional information to support his request for eligibility for a security clearance. Applicant is a 43-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He served on active duty in the U.S. Air Force from 1983 until 1989. He held a security clearance while he served at a nuclear weapons storage facility in the military and has maintained a security clearance in his civilian career (GE 1). Applicant\u2019s first marriage ended in divorce in 1999 after a long separation. He has one son from that marriage. Applicant and his wife had joint custody of their son. Initially, Applicant was not court ordered to pay child support. However, he voluntarily paid support for his son directly to his ex-wife (Tr. 77). When his son was three years old, he came to live with him for about nine months. The son returned to live with his mother because she decided she could raise her child at that time. Applicant\u2019s ex-wife decided that she wanted their son to live with his father when he was five years old. Applicant had his son for five years until he was 10 years old (joint custody with primary residence) (Tr. 78). When his ex-wife remarried, she wanted her son back. She went to court to obtain full custody of the child. Applicant obtained a lawyer and spent a large sum of money on legal fees in a custody battle. During that time period, A",

The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding\nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of\nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review\nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative\nguidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective\nwithin the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n \nApplicant requested a hearing before an Administrative Judge. I received the\ncase assignment on February 27, 2008. DOHA issued a notice of hearing on March 3,\n2008, and I convened the hearing as scheduled on April 3, 2008. The government\noffered Exhibits (GE) 1 through 4 which were received without objection. Applicant\ntestified, submitted Exhibits (AE) A through G, without objection, and presented the\ntestimony of eleven witnesses. DOHA received the transcript of the hearing (Tr.) On\nApril 22, 2008\n\n2\nApril 11, 2008. Based upon a review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony,\neligibility for access to classified information is granted.\nFindings of Fact\nIn his Answer to the SOR, dated February 11, 2008, Applicant admitted the\nfactual allegations in \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.I of the SOR, with explanations. He provided additional\ninformation to support his request for eligibility for a security clearance. \nApplicant is a 43-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He served on active\nduty in the U.S. Air Force from 1983 until 1989. He held a security clearance while he\nserved at a nuclear weapons storage facility in the military and has maintained a\nsecurity clearance in his civilian career (GE 1).\nApplicant\u2019s first marriage ended in divorce in 1999 after a long separation. He\nhas one son from that marriage. Applicant and his wife had joint custody of their son.\nInitially, Applicant was not court ordered to pay child support. However, he voluntarily\npaid support for his son directly to his ex-wife (Tr. 77). When his son was three years\nold, he came to live with him for about nine months. The son returned to live with his\nmother because she decided she could raise her child at that time. Applicant\u2019s ex-wife\ndecided that she wanted their son to live with his father when he was five years old.\nApplicant had his son for five years until he was 10 years old (joint custody with primary\nresidence) (Tr. 78). When his ex-wife remarried, she wanted her son back. She went to\ncourt to obtain full custody of the child. Applicant obtained a lawyer and spent a large\nsum of money on legal fees in a custody battle. During that time period, Applicant\nsought the advice of a credit counseling service (Tr.150).  \nAfter Applicant left the Air Force, he worked in various jobs. He was also\nsupporting his son and his estranged wife. In 1996, he obtained a position with the\nAmeriCorps program and became interested in technology. He enjoyed the work but\nmade a small salary. He took courses at night to become certified and obtain better\nemployment (Tr. 80).\nApplicant began working full time in the field of computers and technology as a\njunior engineer in 1999. In 2000, Applicant remarried and was earning a high salary\n($100,000). His second wife also worked. They purchased a house and they decided to\nhave children. Due to health reasons, his wife stopped working during the pregnancy.\nTheir first child was born in 2002. Applicant\u2019s medical insurance did not cover all the\nmedical bills for his son\u2019s medical needs. Applicant became suddenly unemployed in\nJanuary 2003. This created grave financial difficulties. Applicant started a consulting\ncompany in 2003 with two other partners. Unfortunately, the business failed in April\n2003. This left him with more delinquent debts (Tr. 85). \nThus, Applicant\u2019s financial difficulties worsened in 2003. He was unemployed in\n2003 and because his wife\u2019s second pregnancy was very difficult and she was on bed\nrest for the last six months of the pregnancy, he took extra time from work (Tr. 86). In\n\nThis is the amount alleged at the time of the SOR. The amount has increased.\n1\n3\n2004, his second son was born premature with a multitude of medical issues. He was\nworking and had health insurance but the deductible was $10,000. His wife could not\nwork due to the health problems of their one son. Therefore, Applicant was reduced to\none income.\nIn 2005, Applicant and his wife sold their home. At that time the housing market\nwas booming and he had an opportunity to purchase a larger home for the family. They\nrefinanced the house and had a mortgage rate of 8.5%. Applicant believed he could\nrefinance again in two years at a lower rate. However, his plan to refinance did not\noccur because he suddenly was unemployed again from January 2007 until March\n2007. The bank would not refinance his home at that time. As a result, Applicant fell\nbehind in his home equity line of credit.\n. \nIn May 2007, Applicant began his current employment as a senior engineer with\na contractor. It was a good opportunity and Applicant believes it will be a steady project.\nThe SOR alleges delinquent debts in the amount of approximately $14,000.\nAllegation \u00b6 1.a is an account that went into collection in October 2006 in the amount of\n$126 for a medical provider. Applicant researched the debt but has not discovered the\nsource. This remains unpaid. Applicant plans to dispute this debt with the credit bureau.\nHis credit report confirms that he has paid other medical providers (GE 2). \nAllegation \u00b6 1.b is an account that is past due in the amount of $1,202.  This is\n1\nan amount past due on a home equity line of credit (Portion of the mortgage).\nApplicant\u2019s scheduled monthly payment on this loan is approximately $670. Applicant\nmade a payment of $800 in December and January and $700 in February and March\n2008. The bank is working with Applicant. Applicant is paying off two more months at\nthe end of April 2008. At the end of April 2008, he will be two months behind instead of\nthree months behind. The bank has agreed that Applicant will pay a small sum each\nmonth toward the later payment. They will divide that over the next 12-month period (Tr.\n132).\nAllegation \u00b6 1.c in the amount of $2,453 is an account for a computer charged\noff. Applicant was making monthly payments on the computer. He fell behind in the\npayments and tried to arrange a settlement with them. He spoke to them in February\n2007. He was unemployed at the time. He had agreed to settle the account. He sent\nthem a postdated check for $1,358. Applicant called the company after he mailed the\ncheck and told them not to cash the check because something had come up and he did\nnot have the funds. They cashed the check and then Applicant went to the bank for stop\npayment. So, he still owes the $2,453. He does not have any extra money at this time to\nmake a payment (Tr. 136).\nAllegation \u00b6 1.d in the amount of $2,842 was in collection for child support\narrearage. Applicant explained that his oldest son is 19 years old. This six-month\n\n4\narrearage occurred in January 2007 when he was unemployed. He had never been in\narrears prior to that time. This amount is paid (AE A).\nAllegation \u00b6 1.e on a real estate mortgage is past due $5,405. This is no longer\ndelinquent. The amount is now refinanced with the new mortgage rate he just received\nin 2008 (AE E).\nAllegation 1.f is an account that is past due in the amount of $688. Applicant had\ndead trees removed from the area near his house. He has been paying on the account\nbut making partial payments of $50 or $100 in the past few months. The scheduled\nmonthly payment is $375. He made a $400 payment in March. He will continue making\nhis scheduled monthly payments. His plan for later is to agree on a different monthly\npayment plan (Tr. 146). \nAllegation 1.g to the state for debt in the amount of $1,397 resulted from his\nfailed business which dissolved in 2006. Applicant has not pursued this matter yet. He\nis, however, trying to take care of this on his own without the other two partners in the\nconsulting firm. (GE 3 at 11). \nWhen Applicant was first investigated, other debts were listed. He paid them.\nWhen he completed his latest personal financial statement in September 2007, he listed\na negative $47 monthly remainder after expenses (GE 3). Applicant has personal loan\nwith a friend in the amount of approximately $99,000. His friend loaned him money\nbeginning in 2002 until 2007. Applicant has used that money for various things. He was\nrepaying him $746 monthly until November 2007. His friend agreed that Applicant could\nstart repaying again when Applicant\u2019s wife finished school in June 2008.    \nApplicant\u2019s current monthly net income is $10,084.31. This includes an additional\n15 hours of part time work and his Veteran\u2019s Benefit of $117. His remainder is $879.\nApplicant\u2019s wife is graduating in June. She will be marketable and hopes to have a job in\nthe medical coding field (Tr. 94). Applicant has calculated a projected income for his\nwife based on average salary figures for people hired in medical coding. He has detailed\nhis projected net remainder when his wife is employed and how the money will be\napplied to his accounts (AE G).\nApplicant has not received any financial counseling recently. However, he met\nwith a bank manager after researching options to have his house refinanced after the\ninitial offer was declined in 2007 when he lost his job. He received a new rate of 5.12%.\nThis will enable Applicant to save $900 a month on his mortgage. He also plans to use\na credit counseling service again as he did the 1990's.\nIn the past few months Applicant called his creditors to make arrangements for\npayments or settlements. He has not officially agreed with each creditor because he\nwants to make certain that he has the income to commit to the plan. He explained at the\nhearing, that he felt as though he \u201cbroke a contract\u201d in the past when he could not pay\nthe agreed upon amount to a creditor, such as the computer debt.\n\n5\nApplicant presented a detailed financial statement and plan at the hearing (AE\nF). He listed his expenses and the direction that he needs to go in. His plan is to use the\nincome from his salary and his wife\u2019s projected income and prioritize the delinquent bills.\nHe will use the services of a consumer credit counseling company because he cannot\nafford to hire a financial advisor. He wants to keep current accounts out of collection\nand money that he has left each month will be applied to the delinquent accounts. He\nno longer has child support to pay. He also will work at home one day a week and has\ncalculated how much he will save in gas and tolls. Applicant acknowledges that it will\ntake him more than 15 years to repay the personal loan. His goal is to pay the\ndelinquent debts within a short period of time. He has reduced his daily expenses by not\ngoing out to eat and socializing. \nApplicant\u2019s current manager is aware of Applicant\u2019s financial difficulties. He\nrecommends him highly and states he is a key player in a critical project for the\ncompany. His colleagues describe him as loyal, extremely reliable and with\nunquestionable personal character. A colleague described Applicant as a mission\noriented and capable under stress. He is described as a role model for younger\nengineers. \nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2,\nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the\n\u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available, reliable\ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a\ndecision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\n\n6\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of\nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \nAnalysis\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set\nout in AG & 18:      \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to\nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended\nis at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under\nAG & 19(a), an Ainability or unwillingness to satisfy debts@ is potentially disqualifying.\nSimilarly under AG & 19\u00a9, Aa history of not meeting financial obligations@ may raise\nsecurity concerns. Applicant accumulated delinquent debt in the amount of\napproximately $14,000. He admits the debts and his inability to pay them. His credit\nreports confirm the debts. The evidence is sufficient to raise these potentially\ndisqualifying conditions, requiring a closer examination.\nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security\nconcerns arising from financial difficulties. Under AG \u00b6 20(a), the disqualifying condition\nmay be mitigated where Athe behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or\noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt\non the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.@ Applicant=s\n\n7\nfinancial worries arose in 2002. He accumulated some delinquent debt due to\nunemployment, his wife\u2019s pregnancy, her unemployment and the medical bills for his\nson. The Applicant\u2019s problems have been ongoing and he has not resolved all his\ndelinquent debt. He volunteered the information about his personal loan. He had been\npaying on that and since his friend is allowing him to not make payments until his wife\nreturns to work, he is not delinquent on that personal loan. l believe the circumstances\nthat occurred do not raise concerns about his current reliability, trustworthiness, or good\njudgment. This potentially mitigating condition applies in part. \nUnder AG & 20(b), it may be mitigating where Athe conditions that resulted in the\nfinancial problem were largely beyond the person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a\nbusiness downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation),\nand the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances.@ As noted above, the\nfinancial problems arose from his 2003 and 2007 unemployment, his son\u2019s medical\nissues and his wife\u2019s inability to work after their two children were born. His youngest\nchild has multiple medical issues. He acted responsibly by finding employment each\ntime he was unemployed. He also tried to refinance his house but the poor economy\nand his sudden unemployment in 2007 prohibited his plan from working. His consulting\nventure failed. Now that he has full time employment, he has asked his company for\npermission to work 15 additional part time hours. I find this potentially mitigating\ncondition is a factor for consideration in this case. \nEvidence that Athe person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem\nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control@\nis potentially mitigating under AG & 20(c) Similarly, AG & 20(d) applies where the\nevidence shows Athe individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or\notherwise resolve debts.@ Applicant has not received financial counseling recently. He\npursued his plan to refinance his house so that he could lower his mortgage and pay\nother debts. His wife is finishing a course that will make her marketable for a job. He\npaid his child support arrearage and took care of the past due mortgage by refinancing\nit with the new one. He consistently makes small payments on his accounts and has\ntried to settle one or two. I conclude these potentially mitigating conditions apply in part.\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness\nof the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include\nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which participation\nis voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent\nbehavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure,\ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d\nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security\n\n8\nclearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful\nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.       \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant served in the U.S. Air\nForce and held a clearance. He has maintained a clearance in his civilian employment.\nApplicant took responsibility for his oldest son after he and his first wife separated. He\ndid not shirk his duties. He was forced to pay large sums on legal fees in a battle for\ncustody. Applicant worked hard in various positions after he left the military. He\ndeveloped a career and expertise in the field of technology. He is praised for his\nprofessional work and his integrity. Applicant remarried in 2000 and decided to have a\nfamily. He could not have predicted the difficulties that his wife would have with her\npregnancies. He also had no way of knowing that he would be unemployed after the\nbirth of their first son. Nor that his youngest son would have severe medical problems.\nThe poor economy was also out of his control. Applicant tried to refinance his house to\nimprove his financial condition but could not do so until April 2008.  His wife will return to\nthe workplace and Applicant has a plan to pay creditors. His income has risen since last\nyear. He works an additional 15 hours a week to have more money to pay his bills.\nApplicant acknowledges that some of his business decisions were poor, but he worked\nwith the information that he had at hand. He has met his burden of proof in this case to\novercome the government\u2019s case. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions and doubts as to\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I\nconclude Applicant has mitigated the security concerns arising from his financial\nconsiderations. \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a: - 1.I:\nFor Applicant\n\n9\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is\nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is granted.\n                                              \n_________________\nNOREEN A. LYNCH\nAdministrative Judge\n",

Nagel, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro Se\n______________\n Decision\n______________\nWESLEY, Roger C., Administrative Judge:\nStatement of Case\nOn July 30, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant\nto Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, and\nDepartment of Defense (DoD) Regulation 5200.2-R, issued a Statement of Reasons\n(SOR) to Applicant, which detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary\naffirmative determination of eligibility for granting a security clearance, and\nrecommended referral to an administrative judge to determine whether a security\nclearance should be granted, continued, denied or revoked.\nApplicant responded to the SOR on August 24, 2008 and requested a hearing.\nThe case was assigned to me on October 16, 2008.  It was scheduled for hearing on\nNovember 14, 2008.  A hearing was held on November 14, 2008, for the purpose of\nconsidering whether it would be clearly consistent with the national interest to grant,\ncontinue, or deny, Applicant\u2019s application for a security clearance.  At hearing, the\nGovernment's case consisted of seven exhibits; Applicant relied on one witness\n(himself) and no exhibits.  The transcript (R.T.) was received on December 14, 2008.\nBased upon a review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility for\naccess to classified information is denied. \nDecember 30, 2008\n\nFOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY\nWhen unredacted this document contains information\nEXEMPT FROM MANDATORY DISCLOSURE under the FOIA\nExemption 6 applies\n2\nSummary of Pleadings\nUnder Guideline D, Applicant is alleged to (a) have been charged with a lewd or\nlascivious act with a child under age 14, to which he pleaded no contest and was\nsentenced to three years of probation, one year in jail, and a fine, (b) have been in\ntherapy for the past four years trying to understand his behavior that led to the charge,\n\u00a9) be a registered sex offender, (d) have accessed pornographic web sites about once\nor twice a week in 2003 on his computer while company employed, for which he was\nissued a final written warning in December 2003, and (e) have installed a \u201cpurity scan\u201d\nsoftware on his computer in 2003 while company employed.  The allegations covered\nunder Guideline D are incorporated under Guideline J as well.  \nFor his answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted most of the allegations with\nexplanations, but denied installing any programs on his company computer without first\nobtaining pre-approval from his employer. He also denied any unwillingness to comply\nwith laws, rules, and regulations, and any failure to provide clear, truthful, and honest\nanswers, and cooperate with the security process.  Acknowledging he was wrong in\naccessing pornographic web sites on his company computer, he claimed he has not\naccessed such sites since 2003.  \n                                                          \nFindings of Fact\nApplicant is a 59-year-old-logistics specialist for a defense contractor who seeks\na security clearance.

He completed this program and proceeded to live in a sober living group\nhouse for the ensuing year and a half (attending AA meetings during this time frame).  \nApplicant was eventually prosecuted for sexually abusing the minor daughter of\nthe mother he confessed to in his February 2003 telephone conversation.   In October\n2003, Applicant pleaded no contest to a single charge of child molestation, a felony (see\nex. 2; R.T., at 34, 36).  He was sentenced to three years of formal probation and\nordered to register as a sex offender. The sentencing court accepted Applicant into a\nwork furlough program that released him to work during the day while incarcerated at\n\nFOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY\nWhen unredacted this document contains information\nEXEMPT FROM MANDATORY DISCLOSURE under the FOIA\nExemption 6 applies\n3\nnight (ex. 2).  The sentencing court also ordered Applicant to pay restitution ($620.00)\nand pay for his work furlough program ($1,600.00 a month).\n Applicant was released from this program after eight months and completed his\nprobation in September 2006 (R.T., at 34).  He has no further obligations under his\nprobation terms (R.T., at 34).  Records confirm that Applicant self-reported his 2003\narrest and conviction to his company supervisors (see ex. 7; R.T., at 30).  Applicant also\ntold W2 of his 2003 arrest.  She initially supported him and attended initial court\nhearings.  Eventually, she stopped attending the hearings, though, and divorced him in\n2004 (see ex. 2).\nFollowing his 2003 child molestation arrest, Applicant accessed pornographic\nweb sites on his company computer.  He did this twice a week and freely acknowledges\nhis knowing violations of company work policy.  He was issued a formal warning in\nDecember 2003 (see ex. 6).  The warning letter informed Applicant that he had been the\nsubject of a company ethics investigation concerning his use of company owned\nequipment for an unauthorized purpose.  His formal warning cited him for violating his\ncompany\u2019s standards of business conduct and the employee handbook (ex. 6).  The\nwarning characterized his violation as \u201cserious misconduct\u201d and afforded him one final\nopportunity to demonstrate that he can be a productive employee who adheres to his\ncompany\u2019s policies and procedures.\nSince his 2003 conviction and ethics warning, Applicant has violated no laws or\ncompany ethics requirements, and has not committed any acts of sexual misconduct.\nHowever, he continues to be a registered sex offender with no pre-determined date of\nrelease from the registry (see ex. 3).  Concerned about his arrest and conduct at work,\nhe enrolled in an outpatient therapy program.  He continues to receive therapy in an\neffort to better understand his behavior (see ex. 2).  Asked what prompted him to\nsexually abuse a child and access pornographic work sites, he could not explain his\nactions (ex. 2).\nApplicant denies installing a purity scan on his company computer (R.T., at 31).\nSuch software is designed to erase a user\u2019s steps to a particular site. In an e-mail from\none of his security managers in November 2003 (see ex. 7), this writer claims that\ndetection of Applicant\u2019s accessed pornographic web sites was complicated by purity\nscan hardware installed by Applicant (ex. 7).  Applicant assures that at the time, he did\nnot know what a purity scan software actually was and never installed such a device on\nhis company computer (R.T., at 31).  Without any more probative evidence of his\ninstalling such software, his denials are accepted as credible .\n \nPolicies\nThe revised Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to\nClassified Information (effective September 2006) list Guidelines to be considered by\njudges in the decision making process covering DOHA cases.  These Guidelines require\nthe judge to consider all of the \"Conditions that could raise a security concern and may\nbe disqualifying\u201d (Disqualifying Conditions), if any, and all of the \"Mitigating Conditions,\"\nif any, before deciding whether or not a security clearance should be granted, continued\n\nFOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY\nWhen unredacted this document contains information\nEXEMPT FROM MANDATORY DISCLOSURE under the FOIA\nExemption 6 applies\n4\nor denied.  The Guidelines do not require the judge to assess these factors exclusively\nin arriving at a decision.  In addition to the relevant Adjudicative Guidelines, judges must\ntake into account the pertinent considerations for assessing extenuation and mitigation\nset forth in E.2.2 of the Adjudicative Process of Enclosure 2 of the Directive, which are\nintended to assist the judges in reaching a fair and impartial common sense decision.\nViewing the issues raised and evidence as a whole, the following adjudication\npolicy factors are pertinent herein:\nSexual Behavior\nThe Concern. Sexual behavior that involves a criminal offense,\nindicates a personality or emotional disorder, may subject the individual to\ncoercion, exploitation, or duress, reflects lack of judgment or discretion, or\nwhich may subject the individual to undue influence or coercion,\nexploitation, or duress can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability,\ntrustworthiness and ability to protect classified information.  No adverse\ninference concerning the standards in this Guideline may be raised solely\non the basis of the sexual orientation of the individual.  See Adjudicative\nGuidelines (AG),  \u00b6 18.\nCriminal Conduct\nThe Concern.  Criminal activity creates doubt about a person\u2019s\njudgment, reliability, and trustworthiness.  By its very nature, it calls into\nquestion a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules and\nregulations.  AG, \u00b6 18.\nPersonal Conduct\nThe \nConcern: \nConduct \ninvolving \nquestionable \njudgment,\nuntrustworthiness, \nunreliability, \nlack \nof \ncandor, \ndishonesty, \nor\nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions\nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect\nclassified information.  Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful\nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other\nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process.  AG, \u00b6 18.\nBurden of Proof\nBy virtue of the precepts framed by the revised Adjudicative Guidelines, a\ndecision to grant or continue an applicant's security clearance may be made only upon a\nthreshold finding that to do so is clearly consistent with the national interest.  Because\nthe Directive requires Administrative Judges to make a common sense appraisal of the\nevidence accumulated in the record, the ultimate determination of an applicant's eligibility\nfor a security clearance depends, in large part, on the relevance and materiality of that\nevidence.  As with all adversary proceedings, the Judge may draw only those inferences\n\nFOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY\nWhen unredacted this document contains information\nEXEMPT FROM MANDATORY DISCLOSURE under the FOIA\nExemption 6 applies\n5\nwhich have a reasonable and logical basis from the evidence of record.  Conversely, the\nJudge cannot draw factual inferences that are grounded on speculation or conjecture.\nThe Government's initial burden is twofold: (1) It must prove any controverted\nfacts alleged in the Statement of Reasons and (2) it must demonstrate that the facts\nproven have a material bearing  to the applicant's eligibility to obtain or maintain a\nsecurity clearance.  The required showing of material bearing, however, does not require\nthe Government to affirmatively demonstrate that the applicant has actually mishandled\nor abused classified information before it can deny or revoke a security clearance.\nRather, consideration must take account of cognizable risks that an applicant may\ndeliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information.\nOnce the Government meets its initial burden of proof of establishing admitted or\ncontroverted facts, the burden of persuasion shifts to the applicant for the purpose of\nestablishing his or her security worthiness through evidence of refutation, extenuation or\nmitigation of the Government's case.\nAnalysis  \nApplicant is a seasoned defense contractor and retired Navy officer who pleaded\nno contest to a charge of a lewd or a lascivious act with a child under the age of 14 in\n2003 and was sentenced to three years of probation, one year in jail, and fined.\nAdditionally, he was ordered to register as a sex offender.  Security concerns are raised\nover Applicant\u2019s 2003 conviction and ensuing therapy for the past four years to gain a\nbetter understanding of his actions. Security concerns are raised, too, over his accessing\npornographic web sites on his company computer, and initially over his alleged\ninstallation of purity scan software on his company computer. \nApplicant\u2019s 2003 conviction\nApplicant\u2019s sexual molestation conviction and ordered registration as a sex\noffender raise specific security concerns under both the sexual behavior and criminal\nconduct guidelines.  Most of Applicant\u2019s conduct is covered by Guideline D and can be\nresolved under that Guideline.  Nonetheless, there are discrete disqualifiers under both\nguidelines that cover different aspects of Applicant\u2019s actions associated with his 2003\nconviction. \nJudgment and blackmail concerns exist over Applicant\u2019s 2003 sexual molestation\nconviction.  His conduct reflects serious criminal activity and judgment lapses, as well as\nactions that expose him to risks of potential blackmail. Applicant\u2019s criminal conduct is\nexpressly covered by Guideline J, and is entitled to independent cognizance under this\nGuideline according to the Appeal Board.  See ISCR Case No. 06-20964, at 6 (April 10,\n2008).  Where (as here) there are additional probative adverse information covered by\nGuideline D that is not covered by Guideline J, and which reflects a recurring pattern of\nquestionable judgment, irresponsibility or emotionally unstable behavior, independent\ngrounds do exist for considering questionable judgment and trustworthiness and\nexploitation and coercion risk allegations under Guideline J and Guideline D,\nrespectively.  Authority for considering overlapping conduct under both guidelines is\n\nFOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY\nWhen unredacted this document contains information\nEXEMPT FROM MANDATORY DISCLOSURE under the FOIA\nExemption 6 applies\n6\ncontained in the guidance provided in Enclosure 2, \u00b6 2(d) of the Directive\u2019s August 2006\namendments. \nApplicant\u2019s 2003 criminal conviction is expressly covered by DC \u00b6 31(a), \u201ca single\nserious crime or multiple offenses,\u201d of Guideline J.  While Applicant has completed his\ncourt-ordered jail time and three-year probation period, he continues to be registered as\na sex offender.  Whether he is eligible for cancellation of his registration status is\nunclear.  Without more to indicate his continued registration as a sex offender is an\nongoing condition of his probation or not, DC \u00b6 31(d) may not be applied in these\ncircumstances.\nTurning to the specific allegations covered by Guideline D (several of which\noverlap with those under Guideline J), the pertinent ones associated with Applicant\u2019s\n2003 conviction are fully covered by two of the disqualifying conditions in Guideline D.\nApplicable to the particular facts surrounding Applicant\u2019s conviction are  DC \u00b6 13(a),\n\u201csexual behavior of a criminal nature, whether or not the individual has been prosecuted\u201d\nand DC \u00b6 13(d), \u201csexual behavior of a public nature and/or that reflects lack of discretion\nor judgment. \nWhile there still exists some possibility of Applicant\u2019s being exposed to blackmail\nover his 2003 conviction, the likelihood is small.  He is of record in advising his wife of his\n2003 charges, and his company managers of both his charges and conviction.  Moreover,\nas a registered sex offender, his crime must be presumed to be well known in his\ncommunity and to law enforcement.  So, whatever risk of blackmail that Applicant might\nbe exposed to over his conviction is quite small and unlikely to occur. By contrast,  neither\nhis  disclosures nor registration status absolve him of security concerns about his\njudgment and trustworthiness.  His 2003 sexual molestation conduct reflects not only poor\njudgment but a reckless disposition towards a young minor that could create lasting\nemotional scars. \nConsidering the seriousness of Applicant\u2019s behavior, his actions reflect\nconsiderable recurrence risks associated with his judgment lapses and sexual behavior\nthat are very difficult to reconcile with minimal judgment and trustworthy standards for\ncontinuing clearance eligibility. Applicant\u2019s collective pattern of recurrent behavior is\nindependently covered by the disqualifying conditions previously set forth under Guideline\nD.  \nThe serious judgment lapses that inhere in Applicant\u2019s 2003 charges and\nconviction preclude safe predictive judgments at this time that he will not engage in any\nsimilar activity in the foreseeable future.  Considered together, the timing of his actions,\nthe accompanying circumstances, and the recurrence risks preclude the application of\nany of the mitigating conditions in Guideline J and Guideline D.  So recurrent and recent\nis his conviction and continuing registration as a sex offender that the likelihood of such\nconduct occurring again cannot be safely discounted. \nDespite his therapy efforts to gain a better understanding of his actions, Applicant\nstill does not know what stressors prompted him to engage in the conduct associated with\nhis 2003 conviction.  Without a better understanding of the causes and stressors\n\nFOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY\nWhen unredacted this document contains information\nEXEMPT FROM MANDATORY DISCLOSURE under the FOIA\nExemption 6 applies\n7\nassociated with his actions, he is limited in what he can do to prevent a recurrence.  For\nso long as risks of recurrence exist, Applicant\u2019s conduct cannot be mitigated, either under\nthe guidelines or under the whole person concept.  \nFrom a whole person perspective, Applicant has established a good relationship of\ntrust with his employer.  His managers appear to value his service and contributions in\ntheir e-mail write-up.  He is a retired Navy officer who has held a security clearance\nwithout any reported security or criminal incidents for most of his military and civilian\ncareer. These credits reflect qualities necessary for fulfilling his fiducial responsibilities in\nprotecting accessed classified information.  But these credits are not enough to overcome\nthe recurrent risks that are inherent in the conduct that resulted in his 2003 conviction,\nsentencing and sex offender registration.\nTaking into account all of the circumstances surrounding Applicant\u2019s 2003\nconviction, sentencing and continuing registration as a sex offender, it is still too soon to\nabsolve Applicant of security risks associated with his conduct.  Based on his underlying\nconduct reflecting questionable judgment and trustworthiness concerns, his conviction\nand sentencing, and his continued registration as a sex offender, Applicant does not\nmitigate the Government\u2019s security concerns. Unfavorable conclusions warrant with\nrespect to the underlying conduct covered by subparagraphs 1.a and 1.c of Guideline J\nand Guideline D. \nApplicant\u2019s accessing of pornographic web sites\nAdditional security concerns are raised in connection with Applicant\u2019s accessing of\npornographic web sites on his company computer in 2003. Core judgment and\ntrustworthiness concerns covered by D.C. \u00b6 16(d), \u201ccredible adverse information that is\nnot explicitly covered under any other guideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an\nadverse determination, but which, when combined with all available information supports\na whole-person assessment of questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability,\nlack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations, or other characteristics\nindicating that the person may not properly safeguard protected information,\u201d of Guideline\nE are applicable in this case.  Expressly pertinent are  D.C. \u00b6 16(d)(1) (untrustworthy or\nunreliable behavior . . . ) and DC \u00b6 16(d)(3) (pattern of dishonesty or rule violations).\nWhile Applicant assures that he has learned his lessons from this experience and\nhas not since repeated the exercise, it is difficult to separate risks that inhere in his 2003\nconviction from his turning to pornographic web sites to absorb his emotional needs at the\ntime.  It is still too soon to credit Applicant with any of the available mitigating conditions\ncovered by Guideline E.\nA whole person assessment does not enable Applicant either to avert recurrence\nrisks at this time.  While he warrants considerable praise for his military and civilian\nservice and counseling services he has utilized to help in acquiring a better understanding\nof what prompted his accessing pornographic work sites on his company computer, too\nlittle is known about his counseling efforts and prognosis to enable him to surmount\nrecurrence risks and concerns that he will take reckless, untrustworthy actions in the\nfuture with respect to non-authorized web-sites.  Unfavorable conclusions warrant with\n\nFOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY\nWhen unredacted this document contains information\nEXEMPT FROM MANDATORY DISCLOSURE under the FOIA\nExemption 6 applies\n8\nrespect to the allegations covered by subparagraphs 1.a, 1.c, and  1.d  under Guideline D\nand E.  Favorable conclusions warrant with respect to Applicant\u2019s positive counseling\nefforts covered by subparagraph 1.b of Guideline D (even if not successful in helping him\nto better understand his actions).  The allegations covered by subparagraph 1.e of\nGuidelines D and E are unsubstantiated and concluded favorable to Applicant.\nIn reaching my decision, I have considered the evidence as a whole, including\neach of the factors enumerated in Enclosure 2(a) of the Adjudicative Guidelines of the\nDirective.\nFormal Findings\nIn reviewing the allegations of the SOR and ensuing conclusions reached in the\ncontext of the findings of fact, conclusions, conditions, and the factors listed above, I\nmake the following formal findings:\nGUIDELINE D: (SEXUAL BEHAVIOR):             AGAINST APPLICANT\nSub-para. 1.a::\nAgainst Applicant\nSub-para. 1.b::\nFor Applicant\nSub-para. 1.c::\nAgainst Applicant\nSub-para. 1.d::\nAgainst Applicant\nSub-para. 1.e::\nFor Applicant\nGUIDELINE J: (CRIMINAL CONDUCT):            AGAINST APPLICANT\nSub-para. 1.a:\n           Against Applicant\nGUIDELINE E: (PERSONAL CONDUCT):\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSub-para. 3.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nConclusions\nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s security clearance.\nClearance is denied.\n                                          \nRoger C.

His eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance is denied. \n \nApplicant submitted his Security Clearance Application (SF 86), on June 7, 2005. \nOn April 23, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued \nApplicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns under \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations, and Guideline E, Personal Conduct. The action \nwas taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \nIndustry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, \nDefense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as \namended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the \nAugust 26, 2008\n\n \n \n \n \n2\nPresident on December 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for \nSORs issued after September 1, 2006.  \n  \n \nOn May 23, 2008 and June 20, 2008, Applicant answered the SOR in writing and \nrequested that his case be determined on the record in lieu of a hearing.  The \nGovernment compiled its File of Relevant Material (FORM) on June 26, 2008. The \nFORM contained documents identified as Items 1 through 9.  By letter dated June 26, \n2008, a copy of the FORM was forwarded to Applicant, with instructions to submit any \nadditional information and/or objections within 30 days of receipt.  Applicant received \nthe file on July 7, 2008.  His response was due on August 6, 2008. He submitted one \nadditional document within the required time period.  Department Counsel did not object \nto Applicant\u2019s submission. On August 15, 2008, the case was assigned to me for a \ndecision. After reviewing Applicant\u2019s submission, I marked it as Applicant\u2019s exhibit (Ex.) \nA and admitted it to the record in this case.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant is 42 years old. He and his wife have been married since 1987, and \nthey are the parents of two adult children.  From 1984 to 2004, Applicant served on \nactive military duty.  Since 2004, he has been employed as a federal contractor. He has \nbeen employed by his present employer since 2005. He has held a security clearance \nsince 1994.  (Item 5.) \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s yearly salary from his job as a federal contractor is approximately \n$53,000.  His bi-weekly net pay is approximately $1,840.  He receives about $1,300 \neach month in military retirement pay. He has about $12,000 in savings in a 401-K \naccount.  (Item 7 at 3, 5.)  \n \n \nThe SOR contains 15 allegations of disqualifying conduct under AG F, Financial \nConsiderations (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a. through 1.o.) and two allegations of disqualifying conduct \nunder AG E, Personal Conduct (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.a. and 2.b.) The 15 delinquent debts alleged \nin the SOR total $41,238. All 15 allegations of financial delinquency were identified and \nlisted on Applicant\u2019s credit bureau reports of November 1, 2005 and April 15, 2008. In \nhis Answer to the SOR, dated May 23, 2008 and June 20, 2008, Applicant admitted 11 \nof the Guideline F allegations (\u00b6\u00b6 1.b. through 1.e. and \u00b6\u00b6 1.i. through 1.o.) The alleged \ndebts admitted by Applicant total $38,827.  He denied four debts, totaling $2,411 (\u00b6\u00b6 \n1.a., 1.f., 1.g., and 1.h.) He admitted both Guideline E allegations. Applicant\u2019s \nadmissions are admitted herein as findings of fact.  (Item 1; Item 4; Item 8; Item 9.) \n \n \nApplicant was interviewed by an authorized investigator from the Office of \nPersonnel Management (OPM) in July 2006.  In the interview, he told the investigator \nthat in about 1997 he began to spend more than he earned and became financially \noverextended and overwhelmed with debt. He also reported that two vehicles he owned \nwere voluntarily repossessed one in June or July 2004 and the second in late 2004 or \nearly 2005.  He had not contacted the creditors since the repossessions, and so he did \n\n \n \n \n3\nnot know how much he owed on each vehicle.  He was questioned about other \ndelinquent debts but had very little specific information about what he owed and to \nwhom.  He told the investigator he planned to begin paying his past debts in January \n2007.   (Item 6.) \n \n \nIn response to a financial interrogatory from DOHA, Applicant provided a \ndocument from a creditor stating he had satisfied the debt alleged at SOR \u00b6 1.d.  He \nalso provided an undated payment schedule indicating he was disputing the debts \nalleged at SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.g. and 1.l.  However, he provided no documentation to corroborate \nhis dispute of those debts.  Additionally, he provided a settlement offer from a creditor \nwho had repossessed his automobile. He did not indicate whether he had responded to \nthe settlement offer.  (Item 7 at 6, 8, 9; Item 9 at 6.) \n \n \nIn response to the FORM, Applicant provided a letter stating he was participating \nin a credit assistance program in which he was receiving advice on addressing the \ndebts alleged on the SOR.  He expressed an intent to remain in the program until all of \nhis debts had been settled. Nothing in the record suggests that Applicant has \nparticipated in consumer credit counseling.  (Ex. A.) \n \n \nApplicant completed and certified his SF-86 on June 7, 2005.  Question 35 on \nthe SF-86 reads: \u201cYour Financial Record \u2013 Repossessions In the last 7 years, have \nyou had any property repossessed for any reason?\u201d Applicant responded \u201cno\u201d to \nQuestion 35.  Question 38 on the SF-86 reads: \u201cYour Financial Delinquencies \u2013 180 \nDays  In the last 7 years, have you been over 180 days delinquent on any debt(s)?\u201d \nApplicant responded \u201cno\u201d to Question 38.   \n \n \nWhen he was interviewed by an authorized investigator and asked why he \ndenied any property repossessions and delinquent debts on his SF-86, Applicant did not \nprovide a response.  (Item 6 at 10.)  \n \n \n \n \n                                       Policies \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the   \nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, the administrative judge applies these guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \nover-arching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. \nAccording to AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of \nvariables known as the \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider \n\n \n \n \n \n4\nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG & 18:       \n \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \n\n \n \n \n5\noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds.  \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under \nAG & 19(a), an Ainability or unwillingness to satisfy debts@ is potentially disqualifying.  \nSimilarly, under AG & 19(c), Aa history of not meeting financial obligations@ may raise \nsecurity concerns. Applicant provided credible documentation to corroborate his \nassertion that one of his debts had been satisfied. In his response to DOHA \ninterrogatories, Applicant provided documentation to corroborate that he had satisfied a \ndebt for $620, alleged at \u00b6 1.d, that had been charged off as a bad debt. The SOR \nallegation at \u00b6 1.d is concluded for Applicant. \n \nThe Government alleged Applicant owed the debts alleged at SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.f, \n1.g, and 1.h. The basis for the Government\u2019s allegations was Applicant\u2019s credit report of \nApril 15, 2008. Applicant denied owing those debts. In the face of Applicant\u2019s denial, the \ncredit report is insufficient evidence to prove he owes the four debts.  Accordingly, the \nallegations at SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.f, 1.g, and 1.h are also concluded for Applicant. \n \nHowever, Applicant\u2019s additional financial delinquencies demonstrate he \naccumulated substantial debt and was unwilling or unable to satisfy his creditors over a \nconsiderable period of time. This evidence is sufficient to raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 19 (a) and 19(c).  \n \nThe financial considerations guideline also includes examples of conditions that \ncould mitigate security concerns arising from financial difficulties. Several Guideline F \nmitigating conditions could apply to the security concerns raised by Applicant\u2019s financial \ndelinquencies. Unresolved financial delinquency might be mitigated if it happened so \nlong ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to \nrecur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or \ngood judgment. (AG \u00b6 20(a)) Additionally, unresolved financial delinquency might be \nmitigated if the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the \nperson\u2019s control, such as loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected \nmedical emergency, or a death, divorce, or separation, and the individual acted \nresponsibly under the circumstances. (AG \u00b6 20(b)) Still other mitigating circumstances \nthat might be applicable include evidence the person has received or is receiving \ncounseling for the problem and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control (AG \u00b6 20(c) or the individual has initiated a good-faith effort \nto repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. (AG \u00b6 20(d)) Finally, an applicant \ncan offer in mitigation documentary evidence to establish that he or she has a \nreasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of a past due debt and has taken action to \nresolve the issue. (AG \u00b6 20(e).)   \n \nApplicant admitted that his financial problems began in 1997, when he spent \nmore than he earned and consequently found himself enveloped in debt. His financial \nproblems continued, and in 2004, two of his vehicles were voluntarily repossessed.  \n\n \n \n \n \n6\nOne of those repossessions was alleged at SOR \u00b6 1.j. During the time of his financial \nproblems, Applicant had steady employment in the U.S. military and as a government \ncontractor. He offered no explanation for the significant debt which continues to the \npresent day, a situation that raises concerns about his judgment and reliability.   \n \nApplicant has not contacted the majority of his creditors to arrange payment \nplans or to initiate settlement. In 2006 he told an authorized investigator that he would \npay his financial delinquencies in January 2007. He has not done so. Recently, he \nsought professional help in identifying his debts and paying his creditors. Again, he \nstated an intent to satisfy his financial delinquencies in the future. I conclude that that \nnone of the financial considerations mitigating conditions apply to the facts of \nApplicant\u2019s case. \n \nPersonal Conduct \n \nAG \u00b6 15 explains why personal conduct is a security concern: \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process. \n \nIn June 2005, when Appellant answered \u201cno\u201d to Questions 35 and 38 on his SF-\n86, he had  experienced two voluntary vehicle repossessions in 2004 and had a number \nof long-standing financial delinquencies. In his interview with an authorized investigator, \nhe admitted that, since about 1997, he had been spending more than he earned.  In his \nanswer to the SOR, Applicant admitted falsifying material facts in his answers to \nQuestions 35 and 38. This information raises a security concern under AG \u00b6 16(a), \nwhich reads as follows: \u201cdeliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant \nfacts from any personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar \nform used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, award \nbenefits or status, determine security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness, or award \nfiduciary responsibilities.\u201d \n \nI have carefully reviewed all the applicable Guideline E mitigating conditions, and \nI have especially reviewed AG \u00b6 17(a), which reads as follows: \u201cthe individual made \nprompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, concealment, or falsification before \nbeing confronted with the facts.\u201d  The investigative record shows that Applicant falsified \nhis answers to Questions 35 and 38 on the SF-86 he signed and certified on June 7, \n2005.  He did not make a prompt good-faith attempt to correct the falsifications.  The \nfalsifications were brought to his attention in his security interview in July 2006, more \nthan a year after he had signed and certified his SF-86.  When confronted with the facts, \nApplicant offered no explanation for his falsifications. I conclude that AG \u00b6 17 (a) does \n\n \n \n \n7\nnot apply to the facts of Applicant\u2019s case.  I also conclude that no other Guideline E \nmitigating conditions apply. \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n  \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Appellant is a mature person. He \nhas held a security clearance since 1994, and knows the importance of telling the truth \nto the government. He accumulated over $41,000 in delinquent debt and failed to \narrange payment or satisfaction of the majority of those debts over a period of years.  \nHe offered no information that his financial delinquencies, especially over the last four \nyears, resulted from circumstances beyond his control.  Applicant\u2019s unwillingness to \naddress his financial delinquencies suggests that they will continue. His financial over \nextension will likely recur. \n \nAdditionally, Applicant admitted that he falsified material facts in his responses to \nQuestions 35 and 38 on his SF-86. He deliberately concealed facts about his \nautomobile repossessions and his long-standing financial delinquencies.  His failure to \nprovide truthful and candid answers raises serious concerns about his reliability and \ntrustworthiness.    \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant failed to mitigate the security concerns arising from his financial \ndelinquencies and personal conduct.  \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n8\n \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nAGAINST  APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a:                      For Applicant \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.b and 1.c: \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.d:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.e:  \n           Against Applicant \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.f, 1.g, and 1.h: For Applicant \n \n \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.i through 1.o: \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.b:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact DOHA alleged under Guideline F, financial considerations, that Applicant owed 16 delinquent debts totaling $20,863 (SOR 1.a through 1.p) as of November 2007 (Item 1 1). On December 17, 2007, Applicant admitted the debts, but offered in mitigation that they would be discharged in a \u201cno asset\u201d Chapter 7 bankruptcy (Item 2). After considering the evidence of record, I make the following findings of fact. Applicant is a 45-year-old employee of a defense contractor. Applicant applied for his security clearance while he was working for a previous employer as a telecom technician (Item 4). His employer has changed at least twice since he initially applied for a security clearance. It is unclear whether his duty station has remained the same, although he has maintained the same residence since April 1990. His current employer is requesting that he be granted a security clearance. Available information indicates that the debt in SOR 1.k is an updated balance of the debt in SOR 2 1.p and does not represent a separate delinquency. Applicant listed only one account with the original lender on his bankruptcy petition, which was being collected by the assignee in 1.k (Item 10). Applicant\u2019s credit report (Item 8) also indicates that the assignee in SOR 1.k was collecting for the lender in SOR 1.p.

Noel, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro Se\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nMATCHINSKI, Elizabeth M., Administrative Judge:\nAs of November 2007, Applicant owed about $5,130 in medical debt and about\n$10,783 in other unsecured debt incurred over the previous six years when his wages\nwere insufficient to cover his obligations. The debts were discharged in a Chapter 7\nbankruptcy in February 2008 and there is no evidence of any new past due debt.\nClearance is granted.\nStatement of the Case\nApplicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing (e-\nQIP) on August 1, 2006. On November 29, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and\nAppeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing the\nsecurity concerns under Guideline F that provided the basis for its preliminary decision\nto deny him a security clearance and refer the matter to an administrative judge. The\naction was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information\nwithin Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive\n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2,\nNovember 09, 2009\n\nDepartment Counsel indicated in the FORM that the 16 debts totaled approximately $20,780. The\n1\ndebts alleged add up to $20,863.\n2\n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the\nPresident on December 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense as of\nSeptember 1, 2006. \n \nApplicant answered the SOR on December 17, 2007, and requested a decision\nwithout a hearing. On May 13, 2008, the government submitted a File of Relevant\nMaterial (FORM) consisting of eight exhibits (Items 1-8). On May 14, 2008, DOHA\nforwarded a copy of the FORM to Applicant through his employer of record at the time.\nApplicant was instructed to respond within 30 days of receipt. Applicant did not file a\nresponse, but there is no indication that he received the FORM. On June 10, 2009,\nDOHA re-mailed the FORM to Applicant through his present employer without any input\nfrom Department Counsel or any effort to update the financial information. Applicant\nreceived the FORM on June 17, 2009. No response to the FORM was received by the\nJuly 17, 2009, due date. On September 3, 2009, the case was assigned to me to\nconsider whether it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a\nsecurity clearance for Applicant.\nGiven the dated nature of the financial information before me for review and\nevidence indicating that the debts in the SOR may well have been discharged in\nbankruptcy, I reopened the record on October 8, 2009, for further submissions by both\nparties. On October 22, 2009, Applicant timely submitted two documents, which were\nmarked and admitted without objections as exhibits A and B. On October 27, 2009,\nDepartment Counsel submitted bankruptcy records that were added to the May 13,\n2008, FORM as Items 9 and 10. Based upon a review of the government\u2019s FORM,\nincluding Applicant\u2019s Answer to the SOR allegations (Item 2), eligibility for access to\nclassified information is granted.\nFindings of Fact\nDOHA alleged under Guideline F, financial considerations, that Applicant owed\n16 delinquent debts totaling $20,863 (SOR 1.a through 1.p)  as of November 2007 (Item\n1\n1). On December 17, 2007, Applicant admitted the debts, but offered in mitigation that\nthey would be discharged in a \u201cno asset\u201d Chapter 7 bankruptcy (Item 2). After\nconsidering the evidence of record, I make the following findings of fact.\nApplicant is a 45-year-old employee of a defense contractor. Applicant applied\nfor his security clearance while he was working for a previous employer as a telecom\ntechnician (Item 4). His employer has changed at least twice since he initially applied for\na security clearance. It is unclear whether his duty station has remained the same,\nalthough he has maintained the same residence since April 1990. His current employer\nis requesting that he be granted a security clearance.\n\nAvailable information indicates that the debt in SOR 1.k is an updated balance of the debt in SOR\n2\n1.p and does not represent a separate delinquency. Applicant listed only one account with the original lender\non his bankruptcy petition, which was being collected by the assignee in 1.k (Item 10). Applicant\u2019s credit report\n(Item 8) also indicates that the assignee in SOR 1.k was collecting for the lender in SOR 1.p. The collection\nagency was reporting a delinquent balance of $7,112 as of September 2007. The original lender was reporting\na zero balance on its account, presumably because the debt had been transferred.\nDOHA alleged the high credit on the account rather than the past due balance (Item 8).\n3\n3\nApplicant held a succession of blue-collar positions (electrician helper, production\nworker, forklift operator, CNC operator, telecom technician) from at least January 1996.\nHe was married to his first wife from May 1986 to January 1999, and has a 13-year-old\nson, who lives with him (Ex. 4).\nApplicant\u2019s income was insufficient to meet his and his son\u2019s expenses from\n2001 to 2006 (Ex. A). Medical debts totaling $209 from 2001 (SOR 1.h-1.j), $180 from\n2002 (SOR 1.a and 1.g), $671 from 2003 (SOR 1.e and 1.f), $2,940 from 2004 (SOR\n1.c and 1.d), and $341 from 2005 (SOR 1.b) were charged off and in collection as of\nMay 2006 (Item 8). Debts of $258 for radiology services incurred before September\n2006 (SOR 1.n) and of $531 for emergency room physicians\u2019 services (SOR 1.o) also\nwent unpaid and were referred for collection (Item 10). Applicant lacked medical\ninsurance at the time and could not afford to make payments on the debts, which\ncontinued to mount due to collection fees (Ex. A).\nHe fell behind on some consumer credit accounts as well. A credit card with a\ncredit limit of $250 was charged off in the amount of $742 in June 2004 (SOR 1.m).\nThat same month, he opened a credit card account with the lender in SOR 1.p. A\ndelinquent balance of $4,995 was referred for collection to the assignee in SOR 1.k in\nJune 2005.  As of September 2007, the balance had risen to $7,112. An unsecured\n2\ndebt of $2,929 was charged off in March 2004 (SOR 1.l).3\nApplicant contacted his creditors to arrange repayment plans, but the total of the\nrequested monthly payments exceeded his income (Ex. A). He had earned income from\nemployment of $20,473 in 2005 and $25,019.02 in 2006 (Item 10).  Applicant applied\nunsuccessfully for a debt consolidation loan of $10,000 from three different lenders, and\nfamily members were unable or willing to lend him the funds needed to address his\ndebts (Ex. A).\n \nOne year into his job as a telecom technician with a defense contractor,\nApplicant executed an e-QIP on August 1, 2006. He indicated that he had been\nemployed by a succession of commercial companies from January 1996 to July 2005,\nwhen he started with the defense contractor that was sponsoring his current application\nfor a security clearance. He responded affirmatively to the financial delinquency\ninquiries concerning whether he had been over 180 days delinquent on any debts in the\nlast 7 years, and whether he was currently over 90 days delinquent on any debts. He\nlisted one debt, a delinquent credit card debt of $3,500 incurred in June 2004 (SOR 1.k\nand 1.p duplicate debt).\n\n4\nOn August 3, 2007, DOHA asked Applicant to verify payments of his medical\ndebts and of the consumer credit accounts in SOR 1.l and 1.m, and to complete a\npersonal financial statement. In response Applicant submitted an undated Personal\nFinancial Statement on which he estimated that his monthly expenses exceeded his\nincome by about $70. In lieu of listing his debts, he indicated, \u201cBankrupt Chapter 7.\u201d\n(Item 5).\nOn August 29, 2007, the law firm retained to handle a Chapter 7 bankruptcy filing\nfor Applicant notified DOHA of an anticipated filing date within the next 60 days (Item 6).\nIn conjunction with his bankruptcy filing, Applicant completed in-person credit\ncounseling on September 10, 2007. On October 24, 2007, Applicant filed an individual\nbankruptcy petition under Chapter 7, listing assets of $5,235 and liabilities of $23,150,\nincluding $20,055 in unsecured debt and $1,814 owed his bankruptcy lawyer. Applicant\nlisted as unsecured debt the delinquent accounts alleged in the SOR and three other\nconsumer credit card debts that had been current before he elected to pursue\nbankruptcy in August 2007 (Items 8, 10). Applicant remarried in 2007, and he listed joint\nincome of $4,088.60 and expenses of $4,083 per month. His spouse, who was not a co-\ndebtor in the bankruptcy, had $15,287.81 in employment income from January to mid-\nOctober 2007. Applicant had earned $25,430.63 over that time frame. Applicant elected\nto retain his motor vehicle (a 1995 minivan with 175,777 miles) on which he was making\n$200 monthly payments. The balance remaining on his car loan was $1,281 as of\nOctober 2007 (Item 10). Applicant was granted a \u201cno asset\u201d Chapter 7 bankruptcy\ndischarge on February 25, 2008 (Items 7, 9), releasing him of any liability for the\ndischargeable debts listed on his bankruptcy petition, which includes the debts in the\nSOR.\nAs of September 18, 2009, Applicant\u2019s hourly wage was about $21.06. His take-\nhome pay for 74 hours was $1,175. His gross earnings to date for 2009 were\n$37,934.64 (Ex. B).\nPolicies\nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized that the Executive Branch has\nsubstantial discretion in regulating access to information pertaining to national security,\nemphasizing \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v.\nEgan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). When evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security\nclearance, the administrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines\n(AG). In addition to brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative\nguidelines list potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to\nbe considered in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of\nhuman behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the\nadjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair,\nimpartial and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a\nconscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d\n\n5\nThe administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the\nperson, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based\non the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the\ngovernment must present evidence to establish controverted facts alleged in the SOR.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is responsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and\nother evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by applicant or\nproven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The applicant has the ultimate burden of\npersuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship\ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government\nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to\nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk\nthat the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified\ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation\nas to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Section 7\nof Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national\ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant\nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access\nto classified or sensitive information).\nAnalysis\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nThe security concern about finances is set out in AG \u00b6 18:\nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to\nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended\nis at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.\nAs of November 2007, Applicant owed about $5,130 in medical debt in collection\nand another $10,783 in delinquent consumer credit balances from 2004/05. AG \u00b6 19(a),\n\u201cinability or unwillingness to satisfy debts,\u201d and \u00b6 19(c), \u201ca history of not meeting\nfinancial obligations,\u201d are implicated.\n\n6\nConcerning potential factors in mitigation, AG \u00b6 20(a), \u201cthe behavior happened so\nlong ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to\nrecur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or\ngood judgment,\u201d cannot reasonably be applied. Applicant had 15 outstanding delinquent\naccounts that were incurred in or before 2005 that he had not resolved as of November\n2007. Some medical debts were for as little as $33 and $50.\nAG \u00b6 20(b), \u201cthe conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely\nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn,\nunexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the individual\nacted responsibly under the circumstances,\u201d applies. Applicant incurred sizeable\nmedical costs when he did not have insurance, including an unexpected hospital bill\n(SOR 1.c) and emergency room physician services (SOR 1.o). Low wage earnings were\nalso a contributing factor. His gross  income for 2005 was $20,473, barely enough to\nsupport himself and his son. He earned $25,019.02 in 2006, but even with the increase,\nhe clearly did not have the means to address his debt in a reasonably timely manner.\nWhether due to poor credit because of collection accounts, his low income, or a\ncombination of these and other factors not evident in the file, Applicant was three times\ndenied in his efforts to obtain a debt consolidation loan. Family members also were not\nwilling to lend him money or to cosign on a loan for him. Before the SOR was issued,\nApplicant reluctantly filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy. Given his limited income, it is\nconsidered a good faith effort to resolve his debts under AG \u00b6 20(d), \u201cthe individual\ninitiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts,\u201d even\nthough his creditors were not satisfied in his \u201cno asset\u201d discharge.\nSince his creditors are legally barred from pursuing collection of the discharged\ndebts, much of Applicant\u2019s financial pressure has been eliminated. But a discharge does\nnot guarantee financial solvency or the sound judgment that must be demanded of\nthose persons granted access to classified information. In Applicant\u2019s favor, there is no\nevidence of lavish expenditure. As of his bankruptcy, he was making timely payments\non a 1995 model-year minivan with 175,000 miles on it. His credit report of November\n2007 (Item 8) shows he had been making his payments on three credit cards with a\ntotal balance of $4,424 until he decided to file for bankruptcy and he included those\naccounts on his petition. As of mid-September 2009, his gross earnings for the year\nwere $37,934.64, which is considerably more than he earned in 2007. There is no\nevidence of any delinquency since his bankruptcy. Resolution of his delinquent debts\nthrough a Chapter 7 discharge, when coupled with his improved income situation,\nsatisfies AG \u00b6 20(c), \u201cthe person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem\nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control.\u201d\nWhole-Person Concept\nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an\napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the conduct\n\n7\nand all the circumstances in light of the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6\n2(a):\n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security\nclearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful\nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.\nThe DOHA Appeal Board has addressed a key element in the whole person\nanalysis in financial cases stating, in part, \u201can applicant is not required, as a matter of\nlaw, to establish that he has paid off each and every debt listed in the SOR. All that is\nrequired is that an applicant demonstrate that he has \u2018 . . . established a plan to resolve\nhis financial problems and taken significant actions to implement that plan.\u2019\u201d ISCR Case\nNo. 07-06482 at 2-3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008) (internal citations omitted). While a\nbankruptcy discharge is not entitled to the same weight in mitigation as a track record of\nrepayment, Applicant filed reluctantly and only after he had tried to obtain loans needed\nto make payments. There is no evidence that he has abused the fresh start afforded\nhim through the bankruptcy. The government had an opportunity to update the record in\nOctober 2009, and did not raise any new concerns. Based on the information before\nme, I conclude that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant a\nsecurity clearance.\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F: FOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.f:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.g:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.h:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.i:\nFor Applicant\n\n8\nSubparagraph 1.j:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.k:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.l:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.m:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.n:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.o:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.p:\nFor Applicant (Duplicate of 1.k)\nConclusion\nIn light of the record in this case, it is clearly consistent with the national interest\nto grant Applicant eligibility for a security clearance.

On December 20, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA)\nissued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns under Guideline F\nfor Applicant. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding\nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of\nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review\nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative\nguidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective\nwithin the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n \nApplicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on December 28, 2007. He\nanswered the SOR in writing on January 14, 2008, and requested a hearing before an\nApril 10, 2008\n\nApplicant\u2019s response to SOR at 4; Tr. 46.\n1\nGE 1 (Security clearance application) at 1, 7, 8; Tr. 28, 30, 35.\n2\nGE 2 (Credit report, dated January 26, 2007) at 3; Tr. 18-22.\n3\n2\nAdministrative Judge. DOHA received the request in January 2008. Department\nCounsel was prepared to proceed on January 30, 2008, and I received the case\nassignment on January 30, 2008. DOHA issued a notice of hearing on February 12,\n2008, and I convened the hearing as scheduled on March 6, 2008. The government\noffered four exhibits (GE) 1 through 4, which were received and admitted into evidence\nwithout objection. Applicant testified on his own behalf. He did not submit any exhibits at\nthe hearing. DOHA received the transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on March 14, 2008. I held\nthe record open until March 27, 2008, for Applicant to submit additional matters.  On\nMarch 27, 2008, he submitted one exhibit (AE A), which is marked and admitted without\nobjection. The record closed on March 27, 2008.\nFindings of Fact\nIn his Answer to the SOR, dated January 14, 2008, Applicant admitted all the\nfactual allegations in \u00b6 1 of the SOR, except the allegation in \u00b6 1.p, which he denied on\nthe basis it was a duplicate of the allegation in \u00b6 1.m of the SOR. He also provided\nadditional information to support his request for eligibility for a security clearance. After\ndiscussion at the hearing, Applicant acknowledged that the allegation in \u00b6 1.p is not a\nduplicate of the allegation in \u00b6 1.m in the SOR.1\nApplicant is 30 years old and single. He works as a marine machinist for a\nDepartment of Defense contractor. He began this job in December 2006. Applicant also\noperates a landscaping business part-time.2\nApplicant graduate from high school in 1997. After graduation, he worked in the\nrestaurant business for one to two years. He then obtained a job as an independent\ninsurance agent, which he worked until 2002. He worked on commission, which led to a\nfederal tax problem, that has been resolved. He did not have health insurance with this\njob. When he needed medical care, he used a walk-in clinic or the hospital emergency\nroom.  \n3\nIn 2002, Applicant moved north when a long term relationship ended. He\nobtained demolition work, which was not steady work. At first, he had difficulty paying\nhis bills, then after some time, he began working full-time. He paid his current bills, but\nnot his past debts. While home for a visit after being laid off in 2005, the police arrested\nand charged him with driving while intoxicated (DUI). He could not leave the state and\nreturn to his job up north. He did not have a car nor other transportation to any job. He\ngot behind in his bills.

He then found a low-paying, full-time job, where he worked until he\nobtained his current job.4\nApplicant currently lives with his father and drives a car owned by his father. He\nhas not paid rent, but recently started paying his father $200 a month for rent. His gross\nmonthly income is $2,132 from his job and $500 a month from his business. From both\njobs, his net monthly income totals about $2,000. His monthly expenses in addition to\nhis rent total about $600. He applied for a loan to repay his debt, but the his application\nwas denied because of his credit history. He pays his current bills.5\nApplicant incurred his unpaid debts while working in the insurance business and\nwhile he lived up north. The unpaid judgments are from the years 2002 and 2003, and\ntotal $6,128. His remaining unpaid debts primarily related to utility bills, telephones bills,\nand medical bills, and an approximate total of $7,380. Applicant has not made any\npayments on these debts. By letter dated March 27, 2008, he advised that he would be\nfiling a petition for Chapter 7 bankruptcy through his recently hired attorney.6\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s over-arching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6\n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as\nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available,\nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in\nmaking a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\n\n4\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of\nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \nAnalysis\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set\nout in AG & 18:      \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to\nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended\nis at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under\nAG & 19(a), an Ainability or unwillingness to satisfy debts@ is potentially disqualifying.\nSimilarly under AG & 19(c), Aa history of not meeting financial obligations@ may raise\nsecurity concerns. Applicant accumulated delinquent debt, and unpaid judgments over a\nsubstantial period of time. These debts have not been paid. The evidence is sufficient to\nraise these potentially disqualifying conditions, requiring a closer examination.\nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security\nconcerns arising from financial difficulties. Under AG \u00b6 20(a), the disqualifying condition\nmay be mitigated where Athe behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or\n\n5\noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt\non the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.@ Creditors\nobtained judgments against Applicant in 2002 and 2003, which have not been paid. He\nincurred more debts in 2005 and early 2006, which remain unpaid. He has made no\neffort to pay these debts. This potentially mitigating condition is not applicable. \nUnder AG & 20(b), it may be mitigating where Athe conditions that resulted in the\nfinancial problem were largely beyond the person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a\nbusiness downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation),\nand the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances.@ In 2005, Applicant\u2019s\nemployer laid him off his job, a factor beyond his control. On a visit home, he received a\nDUI. He could not leave his home state. He did not work because he did not have\ntransportation. He eventually moved home and started working. He did not use his\nexcess income to pay any of his old outstanding debts, and has not made any effort to\nresolve the old debts. He does pay his current bills. I find this potentially mitigating\ncondition partially applies in this case. \nEvidence that Athe person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem\nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control@\nis potentially mitigating under AG & 20(c). Similarly, AG & 20(d) applies where the\nevidence shows Athe individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or\notherwise resolve debts.@ Applicant has not contacted a financial counseling service nor\nhas he resolved any of his delinquent debts, except the tax lien. I conclude these\npotentially mitigating conditions do not sufficiently apply to mitigate financial concerns.\nThe remaining mitigating conditions, AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(e) and 20(f) are not applicable in this\ncase.\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):\n\u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security\nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration\nof the guidelines and the whole person concept.       \n\n6\nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant\u2019s financial problems are\nlong standing. He paid his federal tax lien, but has not made a sufficient effort to resolve\nhis other debts. He did lose his job in 2005, which is the reason for some of his smaller\ndebts. He, however, has worked for the last two years and has not made paid or\notherwise resolved his old debts, even the very small debts, despite sufficient net\nincome each month to make some progress on his delinquent debts. The issue in this\ncase is not simply whether all his debts are paid. It is whether his financial\ncircumstances raise concerns about his fitness to hold a security clearance. Applicant\u2019s\ndelinquent debts remain unpaid. He has not taken responsibility for most of his unpaid\ndebts. His lack of financial responsibility raises security concerns. (See AG & 2(a)(1).)  \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance.

Howry, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro Se\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nWHITE, David M., Administrative Judge:\nApplicant submitted his Security Clearance Application (SF 86), on February 23,\n2007. On September 28, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA)\nissued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns under Guideline F\nfor Applicant. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding\nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of\nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review\nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative\nguidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective\nwithin the Department of Defense (DoD) for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n \nApplicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on October 11, 2007. He answered\nthe SOR in writing on October 30, 2007, and requested a hearing before an\nAdministrative Judge. DOHA received the request in November 2007. Department\nCounsel was prepared to proceed on January 14, 2008, and the case was assigned to\nme on January 25, 2008. \nMarch 26, 2008\n\n2\nDOHA issued a notice of hearing on February 4, 2008, and I convened the\nhearing as scheduled on February 22, 2008. The government offered exhibits (GE) 1\nthrough 6, which were admitted without objection. Applicant testified on his own behalf,\nand submitted exhibits (AE) A and B, which were admitted without objection. I granted\nApplicant\u2019s request to keep the record open until March 7, 2008, to submit additional\nmatters. DOHA received the transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on March 3, 2008. While the\nrecord remained open, Applicant submitted six letters from coworkers via Department\nCounsel, who forwarded them without objection on March 10, 2008. These letters were\ncollectively marked AE C, and the record was closed. Based upon thorough review of\nthe case file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility for access to classified\ninformation is granted.\nFindings of Fact\nIn his Answer to the SOR, dated October 30, 2007, Applicant denied all the\nfactual allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.j, with explanations. During the hearing,\nhowever, he admitted that, as far as he has been able to determine, he was most likely\njointly liable for each of the debts. Applicant\u2019s admissions and explanations are\nincorporated in the following findings of fact.\nApplicant is a 56-year-old Manager of a major defense contractor. Applicant is a\ncollege graduate who has worked for the company for 28 years. He successfully held a\nSecret clearance from 1983 to 1988, but his duties have not required a clearance again\nuntil recently. His net salary is about $6,800 per month.\nApplicant and his wife married in May 1980. She is also employed, and earns\nabout $60,000 per year. They began having marital problems in 2003. In January 2007,\nshe served him with divorce papers, and he moved out of the family home to an\napartment. He recently moved in with a friend to reduce his monthly rent from $1,100 to\n$500. This will increase his monthly surplus income over regular expenses from $1,200\nto at least $1,800. The divorce proceedings should be final within the month. (GE 6; AE\nB; Tr. at 30, 52, 66, 68.)\nApplicant\u2019s two daughters are ages 30 and 19. The older daughter suffers from\nbipolar disorder, with delusional aspects, that began after she started working. She\nearned a bachelor\u2019s degree with a 3.5 grade average, and two varsity letters in athletics\nfrom a major university. Eventually unable to live on her own, she moved home around\nLabor Day, 2006. She has since needed psychological evaluation and care, which\nApplicant and his wife pay for. (Tr. at 31-33.) His younger daughter is 19 years old. She\nsuffers from obsessive-compulsive disorder, and had difficulty finishing high school. She\nalso lives at home with her mother, and requires significant medical attention. (Tr. at 36-\n37, 76.)\nApplicant has no information concerning the $51 delinquent debt to a collection\nagency alleged in SOR \u00b61.a. An examination of the credit bureau reports (CBR) in the\nrecord shows that this debt was reported by the original creditor, a restaurant, to have\n\n3\nbeen paid in full in July or August 2004. (Compare GE 3 at 5 - 2  entry; GE3 at 13 - 1\nnd\nst\nentry; GE 3 at 15 - 2  entry.) The entry does not appear at all on Applicant\u2019s more\nnd\nrecent CBR. (GE 4.) Applicant and Department Counsel agreed that Applicant fully\nrepaid the $3,323 credit card debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.b. This was his wife\u2019s credit card,\nbut he was an authorized user and jointly liable for her charges. (AE B at 1; Tr. at 59,\n75, 77.)\nThe $4,944 delinquent debt to a store, listed in SOR \u00b6 1.c also involved a joint\naccount. Applicant and his wife used it to buy some furniture. When their marital\nproblems started, they lost track of who was supposed to be making the payments and\nthe account became delinquent. This debt is specifically identified in their Decree of\nDissolution (divorce) to be paid from a $20,000 fund that will be set aside from proceeds\nof selling their home for payment of unsecured debts. This arrangement has been made\nin recognition that they each owe half of their joint debts and should each pay half.\nAppellant\u2019s attorney advised him not to personally pay any of these debts until the\ndivorce provisions are effected because that would simply reduce the total debt of which\nhis wife is to pay half, without reimbursement to him. He will already be providing her\n$1,900 per month in alimony and voluntary support for their daughters, and does not\nfeel he should simply give her more money by paying debts on which she is jointly liable\nand which will be settled under the decree. The house is presently listed for sale, and\nshould sell for at least $440,000. They have an interested potential buyer. The\ncombined mortgage debt outstanding is $295,000. They are also evenly dividing their\n$52,200 worth of non-real estate community property. (AE A; AE B; Tr. at 67-68, 71.)\nThe remaining debts listed in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d through 1.j involve medical bills for\nApplicant\u2019s wife and daughters. One of these is $1,988 and the other six total $700.\nBoth Applicant and his wife have medical insurance through their employers. They had\nsome trouble coordinating first and second payer obligations and remaining deductibles\nand co-pays, particularly since January 2007 when Applicant moved to an apartment\nand had no access to bills. These represent a very small proportion of their significant\nmedical bills over the past several years, and will all be paid jointly in connection with\nthe divorce settlement. His wife has recently resumed some communication to\ncoordinate resolution of these outstanding issues. (Tr. at 53-55, 61-63.)\nIn sum, Applicant remains a joint debtor with his soon to be ex-wife on one\n$4,944 retail debt and about $2,700 in medical bills alleged in the SOR. He could pay all\nof them today, but is following his attorney\u2019s advice to wait for finalization of their\nnegotiated property settlement and divorce so that his wife pays her half. Their family\nhome is likely to sell soon for around $440,000, yielding more than $110,000 for them to\npay joint debt and split the rest. Applicant earns almost $100,000 per year in a secure\nemployment situation, and his monthly income exceeds his regular expenses by more\nthan $1,700.  \nFour senior managers and colleagues from Applicant\u2019s company wrote to\nexpress their complete confidence in his integrity, responsibility and dedication to\nfollowing proper procedures and protecting sensitive information. (AE C.) Applicant\u2019s\n\n4\ndemeanor was serious, his testimony was credible, and he demonstrated both\nunderstanding of, and intent to honorably resolve, his finances in connection with\nfinalizing his divorce proceedings.\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6\u00b6\n2(a) and 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of applicable guidelines in\nthe context of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The\nAdministrative Judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person,\npast and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to classified\ninformation will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I\nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on the\nevidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, \u201cThe applicant is\nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or\nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the\nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d Section 7\nof Executive Order 10865 provides that \u201cAny determination under this order adverse to\nan applicant shall be a determination in terms of the national interest and shall in no\nsense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d \nA person applying for access to classified information seeks to enter into a\nfiduciary relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of\nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\n\n5\nAnalysis\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nAG \u00b6 18 expresses the security concern pertaining to financial considerations:\nFailure or inability to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to\nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially over-\nextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.\nCompulsive gambling is a concern as it may lead to financial crimes\nincluding espionage. Affluence that cannot be explained by known sources\nof income is also a security concern. It may indicate proceeds from\nfinancially profitable criminal acts.\nAG \u00b6 19 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be\ndisqualifying. Of these nine different disqualifying conditions, the Government asserted\nthat two were raised by Applicant\u2019s financial circumstances (Tr. at 123.): \u201c(a) inability or\nunwillingness to satisfy debts;\u201d and \u201c(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations.\u201d \nThe evidence shows that Applicant is quite willing to satisfy his portion of\nremaining delinquent joint debts, and is approaching their resolution in a reasonable\nmanner under the advice and counsel of his divorce attorney. He could use present\nassets to repay those debts in full if he had to, but that would be financially foolish since\nhis wife is jointly liable and has agreed to pay half in connection with dividing their joint\nassets. He has never been unable to pay these relatively minor debts, and has both the\nassets and income to resolve them and remain solvent in the future. Security concerns\nare raised under both AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and 19(c), but the concerns are not significant in light\nof his overall financial and marital situation. \nAG \u00b6 20 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. Four pertinent\nconditions are:\n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred\nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast\ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good\njudgment;\n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely\nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business\ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or\nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances;\n\n6\n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem\nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is\nunder control;\n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or\notherwise resolve debts;\nApplicant\u2019s delinquent debts all arose during his recent marital problems leading\nto his imminent divorce. The first two SOR-listed debts have been repaid in full,\nresolving more than 30% of the alleged total. The remaining $7,700 in delinquencies\narose due to problems coordinating financial issues with his wife as their marriage\nunraveled and he moved out of their home. Their divorce is almost final, and the decree\nsets forth their obligations and agreement to sell their home and pay off their joint debts\nfrom the proceeds. Applicant has reduced his separate living expenses to the point that\nhe has more than $1,700 per month in excess income, and will realize well over\n$50,000 from the pending home sale. His decision not to immediately repay these debts\nis both reasonable and based on advice of his attorney. This establishes substantial\nmitigation under AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a), (b), (c) and (d) for the relatively minor security concerns\nraised by the continuing existence of these debts at the time of the hearing.\nApplicant\u2019s debts did not arise from any lack of judgment, poor self-control, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations. With a salary of nearly $100,000 and\nsubstantial positive monthly cash flow, he is not financially overextended. Combined\nwith his demonstrated integrity and good character, his finances create extremely small,\nif any, risk of illegal activity to generate funds.\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which\nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and\nother permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct;\n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the\nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security\nclearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful\nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.    \n\n7\nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant\u2019s conduct of potential\nconcern involves delinquent debts that were incurred largely due to circumstances\nbeyond his control as his 27-year marriage broke apart. The amount of delinquent debt\nis relatively small, and all but one remaining debt involves medical deductibles or co-\npays arising from his wife\u2019s and daughters\u2019 treatment under different insurance plans.\nHe did not have access to the bills since moving out of their home when served with\ndivorce papers. Applicant is a mature, senior manager in a stable and well-paying job,\nand his wife also earns a substantial salary. He intends to continue financial assistance\nfor his two troubled daughters, but has more than sufficient income to do so. There is no\npotential for pressure, coercion, exploitation or duress since his financial situation is\nminor and on track for prompt full resolution. His pending divorce will eliminate his joint\nobligation for his wife\u2019s debts. This factor, and his substantial solvency, make\ncontinuation or recurrence quite unlikely.  \nOn balance, Applicant presented sufficient evidence to fully mitigate reliability\nand trustworthiness security concerns arising from his former failure to satisfy debts and\nhistory of not meeting financial obligations. He established his integrity, good character,\nand ability to protect classified information. \u201cAn applicant is not required to show that\n[he] has completely paid off [his] indebtedness, only that [he] has established a\nreasonable plan to resolve [his] debts and has \u2018taken significant actions to implement\nthat plan.\u2019\u201d ISCR Case No. 06-12930 at 2 (App. Bd. Mar. 17, 2008) (quoting ISCR Case\nNo. 04-09684 at 2-3 (App. Bd. Jul. 6, 2006)). Overall, the record evidence leaves\nneither questions nor doubts as to Applicant\u2019s present eligibility and suitability for a\nsecurity clearance. For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant has fully mitigated the\nsecurity concerns arising from his financial considerations. \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.f:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.g:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.h:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.i:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.j:\nFor Applicant\n\n8\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is\nclearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a\nsecurity clearance.

After a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, and full consideration of that evidence, I make the following additional findings of fact: Applicant is 49 years old, divorced and widowed from her two husbands, and the mother of two adult daughters. She works as an administrative assistant to a defense contractor manager. She lives with a friend whom she has known since 2003. He is educating her about financial matters. They both contribute to a savings account which has about $7,000 in it. Applicant also has her own savings account with $500 in it. Applicant pays the monthly bills that are in her name, including four credit card bills. Applicant earns about $2,400 monthly, and her companion earns another $3,500 monthly. Applicant has about $3,500 in credit card debt, which she pays at the rate of $260 monthly in total on the debt. Her plan now is to pay off that debt by June 2008. Applicant changed her spending habits from the past twenty years, and now buys only when a purchase of clothing or other items are necessary. For the past five years, Applicant contributed to her Section 401(k) retirement plan on a regular basis, trying to save money for her future.

HOWE\nAPPEARANCES\nFOR GOVERNMENT\nCaroline H. Jeffreys, Esq., Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro Se\nSYNOPSIS\nApplicant is 49 years old and works for a defense contractor in administrative assistant\npositions.  She filed Chapter 7 bankruptcy twice, once in 1986 and again in 1995.  She filed Chapter\n13 bankruptcy in 2004, and successfully completed it in 2007.  Applicant changed her financial\nbehavior since 2004 and mitigated the financial considerations security concerns.  Clearance is\ngranted.\n\nPursuant to Exec.

On August 15, 2007, DOHA issued a Statement of Reasons  (SOR)\n1\ndetailing the basis for its decision\u2013security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial\nConsiderations) of the revised Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) issued on  December 29, 2005, and\nimplemented by the Department of Defense effective September 1, 2006.  Applicant answered the\nSOR in writing on August 27, 2007, and elected to have a hearing before an administrative judge.\nThe case was assigned to me on October 2, 2007.  On November 15, 2007, I convened a hearing to\nconsider whether it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security\nclearance for Applicant.  The Government and the Applicant submitted exhibits that were admitted\ninto evidence.  I kept the record open until November 29  to allow Applicant to submit additional\nth\nexhibits.  She submitted three exhibits to which the Government had no objection.  I marked them\nas Exhibits F-H.  DOHA received the hearing transcript (Tr.) on November 27, 2007.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nApplicant's admissions to all of the SOR allegations are incorporated here as findings of fact.\nAfter a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, and full consideration of that\nevidence, I make the following additional findings of fact:\nApplicant is 49 years old, divorced and widowed from her two husbands, and the mother of\ntwo adult daughters.  She works as an administrative assistant to a defense contractor manager.  She\nlives with a friend whom she has known since 2003.  He is educating her about financial matters.\nThey both contribute to a savings account which has about $7,000 in it.  Applicant also has her own\nsavings account with $500 in it.  Applicant pays the monthly bills that are in her name, including\nfour credit card bills.  Applicant earns about $2,400 monthly, and her companion earns another\n$3,500 monthly.  Applicant has about $3,500 in credit card debt, which she pays at the rate of $260\nmonthly in total on the debt.  Her plan now is to pay off that debt by June 2008.  Applicant changed\nher spending habits from the past twenty years, and now buys only when a purchase of clothing or\nother items are necessary.  For the past five years, Applicant contributed to her Section 401(k)\nretirement plan on a regular basis, trying to save money for her future. She is also working on\npreparing a budget and reading financial self-help books, or listening to tapes on the same subject.\n(Tr. 33-41, 48-51, 65-69, 74-85; Exhibits 1, G)\nApplicant filed Chapter 7 bankruptcy in 1986.  She purchased a house for herself and her\ndaughter about two years earlier.  Then she was laid off from her job, and could not afford to keep\nthe house and pay her debts.  The house was foreclosed by her lender.  She was discharged in\nChapter 7 bankruptcy in 1987. (Tr. 26; Answer)\nApplicant married in 1991.  She had two daughters at that time.  Unbeknownst to Applicant,\nher husband had financial and alcohol problems dating before their marriage.  He did not work\n\n3\nduring their marriage.  Her husband died in April 1996.  Before he died, they filed a joint Chapter\n7 bankruptcy in March 1995, to discharge his debts and hers.  The discharge was granted in October\n1995.  The total debts included in the bankruptcy Schedules D-F was $90,431.  That bankruptcy\npetition was granted by the court in October 1995, and Applicant\u2019s debts were discharged.  Of the\ntotal debts, Applicant now claims her portion totaled $3,881, and her late husband\u2019s portion was\n$75,710.  She did not explain the $11,000 difference in the two totals. (Tr. 28-30; Exhibits 2, 3, 5,\n7, H)\nApplicant remarried in 2000.  She was divorced in 2004.  She separated from her husband\nin 2002.  She filed a Chapter 13 bankruptcy in March 2004.  That bankruptcy included various debts,\nand federal, state, and local income debts for 2003.  Applicant reduced her withholding to give\nherself more cash each month, but the withholding was insufficient to pay her total taxes due.\nApplicant paid the bankruptcy trustee $247 monthly starting in June 2004.  She successfully\ncompleted that bankruptcy and was discharged in May 2007.  Applicant included debts of her former\nhusband in the bankruptcy filing.  Of the total debts discharged, $7,938 were Applicant\u2019s debts, and\n$5,452 were incurred by her husband. (Tr. 31, 32; Exhibits 1-4, 6, G, H)\nApplicant is considered by her supervisors and co-workers to be very competent, a dedicated\nworker with high ideals, having integrity and ambition, and with good judgment.  They also consider\nher to be logical and practical.  Her work is done in a timely and thorough manner. (Exhibits A-D)\nPOLICIES\n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d  Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S.\n518, 528 (1988).  As Commander in Chief, the President has \u201cthe authority to . . . control access to\ninformation bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently\ntrustworthy to occupy a position . . . that will give that person access to such information.\u201d  Id. at\n527.  The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants\neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly consistent the\nnational interest to do so.\u201d  Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information with Industry\n\u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960).  Eligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the\nsecurity guidelines contained in the Directive.  An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of\ndemonstrating that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security\nclearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3.\nThe adjudication process is based on the whole person concept.  All available, reliable\ninformation about the person, past and present, is to be taken into account in reaching a decision as\nto whether a person is an acceptable security risk.  Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth personnel\nsecurity guidelines, as well as the disqualifying conditions (DC) and mitigating conditions (MC)\nunder each guideline that must be carefully considered in making the overall common sense\ndetermination required.  \nIn evaluating the security worthiness of an applicant, the administrative judge must also\nassess the adjudicative process factors listed in \u00b6 6.3 of the Directive.  Those assessments include:\n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct,\nand the extent of knowledgeable participation; (3) how recent and frequent the behavior was; (4) the\n\n4\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the voluntariness of participation; (6)\nthe presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood\nof continuation or recurrence (See Directive, Section E2.2.1. of Enclosure 2). Because each security\ncase presents its own unique facts and circumstances, it should not be assumed that the factors\nexhaust the realm of human experience or that the factors apply equally in every case.  Moreover,\nalthough adverse information concerning a single condition may not be sufficient for an unfavorable\ndetermination, the individual may be disqualified if available information reflects a recent or\nrecurring pattern of questionable judgment, irresponsibility, or other behavior specified in the\nGuidelines.\nThe decision to deny an individual a security clearance is not necessarily a determination as\nto the loyalty of the applicant.  See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 7.  It is merely an indication that the applicant\nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for\nissuing a clearance.\nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the personal\nor professional history of the applicant that disqualify, or may disqualify, the applicant from being\neligible for access to classified information.  The Directive presumes a nexus or rational connection\nbetween proven conduct under any of the disqualifying conditions listed in the guidelines and an\napplicant\u2019s security suitability.  See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 at 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).  All that\nis required is proof of facts and circumstances that indicate an applicant is at risk for mishandling\nclassified information, or that an applicant does not demonstrate the high degree of judgment,\nreliability, or trustworthiness required of persons handling classified information.  ISCR Case No.\n00-0277, 2001 DOHA LEXIS 335 at **6-8 (App. Bd. 2001).  Once the Government has established\na prima facie case by substantial evidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain,\nextenuate, or mitigate the facts.  See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.  An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of\ndemonstrating that is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security\nclearance. ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. 2002).  \u201cAny doubt as to whether access to\nclassified information is clearly consistent with national security will be resolved in favor of the\nnational security.\u201d Directive \u00b6 E2.2.2.  \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if they must,\non the side of denials.\u201d  Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  See Exec. Or. 12968 \u00a7 3.1(b).\nBased upon a consideration of the evidence as a whole, I find the following adjudicative\nguideline most pertinent to an evaluation of the facts of this case:\nGuideline F: Financial Considerations: The Concern: Failure or inability to live within one\u2019s\nmeans, satisfy debts, and meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment,\nor unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which could raise questions about an\nindividual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information.  An individual\nwho is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.\nCompulsive gambling is a concern as it may lead to financial crimes including espionage.  Affluence\nthat cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a security concern.  It may indicate\nproceeds from financially profitable criminal acts.\nCONCLUSIONS\n\n5\nFinancial Considerations: Applicant has a history of not spending her income in a\nresponsible manner.  In each of the present and previous two decades, she filed bankruptcy to rid\nherself of her debts.  The first two bankruptcies in 1986 and 1995 were Chapter 7 bankruptcy\nactions, in which all of her debts were eliminated under the bankruptcy law.  In 2004, she filed a\nChapter 13 bankruptcy action, and consistently made her monthly payments until she completed the\nplan in June 2007.  The disqualifying conditions applicable are Financial Considerations\nDisqualifying Condition (DC) \u00b619.a. (inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts), and \u00b619.c. (a\nhistory of not meeting financial obligations).  \nApplicant filed her 1986 bankruptcy when she lost her job.  That situation was beyond her\ncontrol, and she had little money with which to pay her debts.  Bankruptcy is a legal mechanism by\nwhich a person may eliminate debt they are unable to repay.  Her second bankruptcy in 1995\noccurred when her first husband disclosed his excessive debts incurred before their marriage.  He\ndid not work during the marriage.  They filed Chapter 7 bankruptcy and were discharged in October\n1995.  Her latest bankrupt occurred because of debts she and her former second husband incurred\nduring their marriage.  She used the Chapter 13 installment payment plan under the protection of the\nbankruptcy court to repay those debts.  \nApplicant has changed her financial ways since 2004.  She faithfully executed the Chapter\n13 plan over a three-year period.  She now is preparing a budget to guide her monthly expenditures.\nShe changed her attitude toward spending with the help of her companion, and now only spends to\nbuy necessities, not on whims.  She saves money into two savings accounts and her Section 401(k)\nplan. Her credit card debts are being paid monthly in the amount of $260 on a $3,500 debt.  Her\ncompanion instructs her on proper financial procedures.  Her financial problems are resolved through\nbankruptcy and under control making a recurrence unlikely.\nUnder these facts, the three Financial Considerations Mitigating Conditions (MC) apply:\n\u00b620.b (the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s control\n(e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce\nor separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances);  \u00b620.c. (the person has\nreceived or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or there are clear indications that the problem\nis being resolved or is under control); and,  \u00b620.d (the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay\noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts).\nWhole Person Analysis\n\u201cThe adjudicative process is an examination of a sufficient period of a person\u2019s life to make\nan affirmative determination that the person is eligible for a security clearance.\u201d AG \u00b6 2(a). \u201cEach\nsecurity clearance decision must be a fair and impartial common sense determination based upon\nconsideration of all the relevant and material information and the pertinent criteria and adjudication\npolicy.\u201d Directive \u00b6 6.3. \u201cAvailable, reliable information about the person, past and present,\nfavorable and unfavorable, should be considered in reaching a determination.\u201d AG \u00b6 2(a). In\nevaluating Applicant\u2019s case, I have considered the adjudicative process factors listed in the AG \u00b6\n2(a).\n\n6\nThere are nine adjudicative factors to apply.  All nine are relevant to Applicant\u2019s past\nfinancial situation.  The continued spending of money without a plan to repay it, resulting in three\nbankruptcy actions in the past nineteen years is serious conduct.  However, in each case there were\nexternal forces which contributed to those actions. \nNext, while Applicant should have saved more of her money, spent less, and planned ahead,\nher job loss in 1986, and then her first husband\u2019s pre-marital financial and alcohol problems,\ncontributed to situations which left Applicant little choice but to file Chapter 7 bankruptcy in 1986\nand 1995.  In 2004, while divorcing her second husband, she resolved her financial problems with\na plan to repay her debts.  Since then, she had not repeated her behavior, and seems to be controlling\nher spending over the past three years.  \nShe lives with someone who is providing her with good financial advice on restraining her\nspending.  In contrast to her present behavior, her past spending and bankruptcies were frequent, and\nthe latest was recent.  \nApplicant was a mature adult when she incurred the financial problems, but she sought legal\nadvice to extricate herself instead of ignoring her creditors or walking away from her problems.  She\ntestified to changes in her behavior and she was credible and persuasive in that explanation.  Her\ncompanion who testified about their spending and saving habits now was also credible.  She is\nrehabilitated under his guidance.  \nHer earlier spending was motivated by spending for herself and daughters, and she spent too\nmuch money.  But none of her bankruptcies showed debts exceeded $10,000, indicating that her\ndebts were comparably minor.  \nThe totality of the testimony and evidence shows Applicant is a hard-worker, logical and\ncompetent who now has her personal spending under control.  There is little or no likelihood that\npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress to disclose classified information because of her past\nfinancial problems.  Applicant struggled through two bad marriages, three bankruptcies, and raising\ntwo daughters.  She has 17 years before she can retire, draw Social Security, and enjoy life.  Her\nchanged behavior and attitude gives her the chance to put more money into her Section 401 (k) plan\ntoward that retirement.  Without a change in her behavior and with three bankruptcies on her record,\nshe would be in financial difficulties again.\nBased on all of the evidence, I conclude the Financial Considerations security concern for\nApplicant.  I also conclude the \u201cwhole person\u201d concept for Applicant.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nThe following are my conclusions as to each allegation in the SOR:\nParagraph 1.

Glendon, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro se\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nMETZ, John Grattan, Jr., Administrative Judge:\nOn 28 September 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA)\nissued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing security concerns under\nGuidelines F and E.  Applicant answered the SOR 29 October 2007, requesting a\n1\ndecision without hearing. However, Department Counsel timely requested a hearing in\naccordance with the Directive. DOHA assigned the case to me 3 January 2008, and I\nconvened a hearing 14 February 2008. DOHA received the transcript (Tr.) 27 February\n2008.\n \nMarch 31, 2008\n\nAnd no falsification was alleged in the SOR for this question. I include the discussion to set the context in\n2\nwhich the other falsifications are alleged in the SOR.\nHowever, because the judgments had been paid, Applicant was not required to disclose them. \n3\nAccordingly, I find SOR 2.a. for Applicant.\nBut which was not alleged in the SOR.\n4\nRecord evidence shows that SOR 1.b. and 1.d. are the same debt. Accordingly, I find 1.d. for Applicant.\n5\n2\nFindings of Fact\nApplicant admitted a 1999 chapter 7 bankruptcy discharge (SOR 1.a.) and a past\ndue medical bill (SOR 1.g). Accordingly, I incorporate his admissions as findings of fact.\nHe denied the remaining SOR allegations. He is a 51-year-old help desk manager\nemployed by a defense contractor since February 2006. He seeks to retain the security\nclearance he held on an interim basis until the SOR was issued.\nWhen Applicant applied for a security clearance in September 2006 (G.E. 1),  he\nanswered \u201cno\u201d to a series of questions [27.a.\u2013d. (financial record); 28.a.\u2013b. (financial\ndelinquencies)], representing that he did not have any history of financial difficulties.\nThe truth was somewhat more complex. In June 1999 [more than seven years before\nhe completed his clearance application (27.a.)], he filed a chapter seven bankruptcy\npetition. In September 1999, he was discharged of $50,000 unsecured debt. Applicant\ntook the literal wording of question 27.a. (\u201cin the last 7 years, have you filed . . .\u201d) in not\ndisclosing his bankruptcy.  Similarly, he had judgments against him for unpaid\n2\ntimeshare fees entered in September 2003 (SOR 1.b.)(paid June 2004) and November\n2004 (SOR 1.c.)(paid December 2004), that were not disclosed on his clearance\napplication (SOR 2.a.)(27.d., unpaid judgments, last seven years).  In addition,\n3\nApplicant had a voluntary repossession of an automobile that resulted in a deficiency\nbalance that he paid in August 2006\u2014another financial issue he concealed from the\ngovernment (27.b).  However, Applicant deliberately failed to disclose delinquent debts\n4\nas required by questions 28.a. (180 days delinquent, last seven years) and 28.b.\n(currently 90 days delinquent). Applicant told his government investigator that he\nconcealed the delinquent debts because \u201che did not want them to hinder him getting the\njob. The security officer that reviewed his security questionnaire was the same person\nthat did the hiring.\u201d (G.E. 8)\nThe SOR alleges, and government exhibits confirm, six delinquent debts  totaling\n5\njust over $4,000. The two judgments against Applicant were paid in 2004. Of the\nremaining four delinquent debts, one was paid in May 2007 (SOR 1.h.), six months after\nhis interview with the government investigator. Two were paid in October 2007 (SOR\n1.e. and 1.f.), after he received the SOR. One remains unresolved (SOR 1.g.). Applicant\ncites no particular reason for his inability to stay current on his accounts following his\nbankruptcy discharge\u2014although he was unemployed between July 2005 and February\n2006 when the contract he was working on expired. However, between August 2003\n\nSee, Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518 (1988).\n6\n3\nand August 2004, he lost $1,500\u20132,000 gambling in an effort to get current on his\naccounts. He does not think that gambling affected his finances, having had money\nproblems before gambling and money problems after gambling (Tr. 62).\nBeyond the debts alleged in the SOR, Applicant\u2019s credit reports reflect ongoing\nfinancial difficulties after his 1999 bankruptcy discharge. He had a home mortgage in\nforeclosure that was paid when he was able to refinance the home. He had several\naccounts that were paid after being charged off by the creditor. He also had several\ndelinquent accounts that he settled for less than the full amount of the debt. Still others\nwere paid after being referred for collection.\nPolicies\nThe Revised Adjudicative Guidelines (RAG) list factors to be considered in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for access to classified information. Administrative\nJudges must assess both disqualifying and mitigating conditions under each issue fairly\nraised by the facts and circumstances presented. Each decision must also reflect a fair\nand impartial common sense consideration of the factors listed in RAG \u00b6 2(a). The\npresence or absence of a disqualifying or mitigating condition is not determinative for or\nagainst Applicant. However, specific adjudicative guidelines should be followed where a\ncase can be measured against them, as they represent policy guidance governing the\ngrant or denial of access to classified information. Considering the SOR allegations and\nthe evidence as a whole, the relevant, applicable, adjudicative guidelines are Guidelines\nF (Financial Considerations) and Guideline E (Personal Conduct).\nSecurity clearance decisions resolve whether it is clearly consistent with the\nnational interest to grant or continue an Applicant\u2019s security clearance. The government\nmust prove, by something less than a preponderance of the evidence, controverted\nfacts alleged in the SOR. If it does so, it establishes a prima facie case against access\nto classified information. Applicant must then refute, extenuate, or mitigate the\ngovernment\u2019s case. Because no one has a right to a security clearance, the Applicant\nbears a heavy burden of persuasion.\nPersons with access to classified information enter into a fiduciary relationship\nwith the government based on trust and confidence. Therefore, the government has a\ncompelling interest in ensuring each Applicant possesses the requisite judgement,\nreliability, and trustworthiness of those who must protect national interests as their own.\nThe \u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d standard compels resolution of any\nreasonable doubt about an Applicant\u2019s suitability for access in favor of the government.6\n\n\u00b6 19.(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts; (b) indebtedness caused by frivolous or irresponsible\n7\nspending and the absence of any evidence of willingness or intent to pay the debt or establish a realistic\nplan to pay the debt; (c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; . . . (e) consistent spending beyond\none\u2019s means, which may be indicated by excessive indebtedness, significant negative cash flow, high\ndebt-to-income ratio, and/or other financial analysis; (f) financial problems that are linked to . . . gambling\nproblems. . .;\n\u00b6 20 (a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such circumstances\n8\nthat it is  unlikely to recur . . . \n\u00b6 20.(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s control . . .\n9\nand the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances;\n\u00b6 20.(c)the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and there are clear indications\n10\nthat the problem is being resolved or is under control;\n\u00b6 20.(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.\n11\n\u00b6 16.(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant and material facts from any\n12\npersonnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar form used to conduct\ninvestigations, . . . [or] determine security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness. . .;\n4\nAnalysis\nThe government established a case for disqualification under Guideline F, and\nApplicant did not mitigate the security concerns. Although Applicant has paid all but one\nsmall debt (SOR 1.g) alleged in the SOR, the record reflects ongoing financial\ndifficulties since his 1999 bankruptcy discharge.  Applicant\u2019s brief unemployment\n7\nprobably contributed to his financial difficulties, but Applicant had financial problems\nboth before and after the unemployment, just as he had financial problems both before\nand after he lost between $18,000 and $24,000 gambling from August 2003 to August\n2004. Further, even though most of the debts alleged in the SOR were small, three\nremained past due after security concerns were raised by the government.\nApplicant meets none of the mitigating factors for financial considerations. His\nfinancial difficulties are both recent and multiple.  The debts were not due to\n8\ncircumstances beyond his control, and he has not acted responsibly in addressing his\ndebts.  There is no evidence that he has sought credit counseling or otherwise brought\n9\nthe problem under control.  Although he may have paid some outstanding debts after\n10\nthe SOR was issued, the timing of the payments does not constitute a good-faith effort\nto satisfy his debts.  Further, given his unwillingness to seek or use financial\n11\ncounseling, there is nothing in the record to suggest that Applicant will put his financial\nproblems behind him. I conclude Guideline F against Applicant.\nThe government also established a case for disqualification under Guideline E,\nand Applicant did not mitigate the security concerns. He deliberately concealed his\nfinancial delinquencies from the government.  He did so knowing that these issues\n12\nwere of security concern to the government, and believing that he might not be hired if\nhe told the truth.\n\n\u00b6 17(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, concealment, or\n13\nfalsification before being confronted with the facts;\n5\nNone of the Guideline E mitigating conditions apply. The concealed information\nwas relevant to a clearance decision. Applicant did not disclose his financial difficulties\nuntil his subject interview.  Applicant\u2019s failure to disclose his adverse finances\n13\ndemonstrates a lack of candor required of cleared personnel. The government has an\ninterest in examining all relevant and material adverse information about an Applicant\nbefore making a clearance decision. The government relies on applicants to truthfully\ndisclose that adverse information in a timely fashion, not when they perceive disclosure\nto be prudent or convenient. Further, an applicant\u2019s willingness to report adverse\ninformation about himself provides some indication of his willingness to report\ninadvertent security violations or other security concerns in the future, something the\ngovernment relies on to perform damage assessments and limit the compromise of\nclassified information. Applicant\u2019s conduct suggests he is willing to put his personal\nneeds ahead of legitimate government interests. I resolve Guideline E against\nApplicant.\nFormal Findings\nParagraph 1.

Applicant\nrequested a hearing.  On February 28, 2008, after the hearing, Administrative Judge Marc E. Curry\ndenied Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.  Applicant timely appealed pursuant to the\nDirective \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nApplicant raised the following issue on appeal: whether the Judge\u2019s adverse clearance\ndecision is arbitrary, capricious or contrary to law.  Finding no error, we affirm.\nApplicant argues that the Judge\u2019s adverse decision should be reversed because the Judge did\nnot give sufficient weight to Applicant\u2019s excellent employment record, and the fact that he had been\na dependable, trustworthy employee who had always followed the applicable security rules.\nApplicant\u2019s argument does not demonstrate that the Judge erred. \nAn applicant with good or exemplary job performance may engage in conduct that has\nnegative security implications. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 99-0123 at 3 (App. Bd. Jan. 11, 2000).  The\nDirective's Guidelines set forth a variety of examples of off-duty conduct and circumstances which\nare of security concern to the government and mandate a whole-person analysis to determine an\napplicant's security eligibility.  A whole-person analysis is not confined to the workplace. See ISCR\nCase No. 03-11231 at 3 (App. Bd. Jun. 4, 2004). \nOnce the government presents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the\napplicant to establish mitigation.  The presence of some mitigating evidence does not alone compel\nthe Judge to make a favorable security clearance decision.  As the trier of fact, the Judge has to\nweigh the evidence as a whole and decide whether the favorable evidence outweighs the unfavorable\nevidence, or vice versa.  An applicant\u2019s disagreement with the Judge\u2019s weighing of the evidence, or\nan ability to argue for a different interpretation of the evidence, is not sufficient to demonstrate the\nJudge weighed the evidence or reached conclusions in a manner that is arbitrary, capricious, or\ncontrary to law.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 06-11172 at 2 (App. Bd. Sep. 4, 2007).\nIn this case, the Judge found that Applicant had a lengthy and serious history of not meeting\nfinancial obligations.  At the time of the hearing, Applicant still had significant delinquent debts and\nwas still in the process of resolving his financial problems.  In light of the foregoing, the Judge could\nreasonably conclude that Applicant\u2019s financial problems were still ongoing.   See, e.g., ISCR Case\nNo. 05-07747 at 2 (App. Bd. Jul. 3, 2007).  \nThe Judge weighed the mitigating evidence offered by Applicant against the length and\nseriousness of the disqualifying conduct and considered the possible application of relevant\nmitigating conditions and whole-person factors.  The Board does not review a case de novo.  The\nfavorable record evidence cited by Applicant is not sufficient to demonstrate the Judge\u2019s decision\nis arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 06-11172 at 2 (App. Bd. Sep.\n\n3\n4, 2007).  After reviewing the record, the Board concludes that the Judge examined the relevant data\nand articulated a satisfactory explanation for his decision, \u201cincluding a \u2018rational connection between\nthe facts found and the choice made.\u2019\u201d Motor Vehicle Mfrs.

Edmunds, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro Se\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nCURRY, Marc E., Administrative Judge:\nOn October 10, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA)\nissued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns under Guideline\nF. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified\nInformation within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense\nDirective 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program\n(January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG)\npromulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective within the\nDepartment of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \nApplicant answered the SOR on October 30, 2007, and requested a hearing\nbefore an Administrative Judge. I received the case assignment on December 6, 2007.\nDOHA issued a notice of hearing on January 11, 2008, and I convened the hearing as\nscheduled on January 30, 2008. During the hearing, I received four Government\nexhibits, five Applicant exhibits, and Applicant\u2019s testimony. DOHA received the hearing\ntranscript (Tr.) on February 13, 2008. Based upon a review of the case file, pleadings,\nexhibits, and testimony, eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nFebruary 28, 2008\n\n2\nFindings of Fact\nIn his Answer, Applicant admitted all of the SOR allegations except\nsubparagraphs 1.b through 1.d, 1.h, 1.m, and 1.p.\nApplicant is a 37-year-old man with a common-law wife and one child, age 12.\nHe has a high school education. For the past six years, he has works for a defense\ncontractor as a security guard (Tr. 12). Currently, he supervises 24 employees. \nApplicant is highly respected on his job. Coworkers describe him as a man of\n\u201cgood character and integrity\u201d (Exhibit D) who is loyal, honest, and hardworking\n(Exhibits E and F).\nSince 1999, Applicant has struggled with managing his finances. That year, he\nfailed to file his federal and state income tax returns, leading to a $597 Internal Revenue\nService (IRS) delinquency and a $1,156 state income tax delinquency. Both the IRS\nand the state taxing authority garnished his wages (Answer to SOR, subparagraphs 1.a\nand 1.b). By 2001, he had satisfied the IRS garnishment leading to its release (Tr. 17).\nThe state garnishment was released after he satisfied it in 2006 (Exhibit B). \nIn February 2001, Applicant\u2019s car insurance payments grew delinquent (SOR\nsubparagraph 1.f), and in June 2001, an installment account grew delinquent (Exhibit 2\nat 20, as listed in SOR subparagraph 1.d). Currently, the insurance payment equals\n$113, and the installment account equals $11,726. Both remain outstanding.\nIn October 2001, Applicant\u2019s mobile home, his personal belongings inside the\nhome, and one of his cars was destroyed in a fire. His wife, whose income contributed\nto the family\u2019s debt management, was hospitalized for a month. At the time, he and his\nwife owed money to the creditor from whom they had purchased the car, and a creditor\nfrom whom they had purchased a television and a stereo. They never filed an insurance\nclaims for these items after their destruction, and the accounts remain outstanding.\nSubsequently, the creditors placed them for collection (Tr. 29, 46). Currently, Applicant\nowes the automobile creditor approximately $8,200 (Exhibit 3 at 2, as listed in SOR\nsubparagraph 1.m), and the stereo and television creditor approximately $1,255 (Exhibit\n4 at 2, as listed in SOR subparagraph 1.p). \nApplicant was displaced for approximately three months after the fire, and lost\ntrack of several bills (Exhibit 2 at 6). Subsequently, he lost another car through\nrepossession (SOR subparagraph 1.q - there is no record evidence of the balance due).\nAlso, he grew delinquent on a personal loan (Exhibit 4 at 7, as listed in SOR\nsubparagraph 1.n). Currently, approximately $434 is outstanding (Exhibit 4 at 10). \nIn early 2002, Applicant purchased another mobile home, and moved back to the\ntrailer home park (Tr. 23). Approximately two years later, he got behind on payments to\nthe creditor that financed the purchase of the new mobile home. In March 2005, it was\n\n3\nforeclosed (Exhibit 2 at 37 as listed in SOR subparagraph 1.c). Currently, Applicant\nowes a deficiency of approximately $35,300 (Exhibit 4 at 11).\nApproximately nine months after moving into the new mobile home, Applicant\npurchased a television (Exhibit 4 at 8, as listed in SOR subparagraph 1.l). Three months\nlater, his payments grew delinquent. Currently, he owes approximately $294 (Id.).\nApplicant owes approximately $2,000 to miscellaneous creditors including a\ncheck cashing company (SOR subparagraph 1.i), a car insurance company (SOR\nsubparagraphs 1.e and 1.g), a credit card company (SOR subparagraph 1.h), a phone\ncompany (SOR subparagraphs 1.j. and 1.k), and a lender (SOR subparagraph 1.o).\nCollectively, he owes approximately $60,000 of delinquent debt.\nIn July 2007, the government propounded interrogatories to Applicant. He was\nasked about the nature of his efforts to satisfy them and their current status (See\ngenerally, Exhibit 2). In response, Applicant, among other things, stated he was \u201cin the\nprocess of trying to clean\u201d his credit (Id. at 3). \nFive months later, Applicant retained a credit repair agency (Exhibit G). With the\nhelp of the agent, Applicant is contacting creditors and attempting to negotiate\nsettlement amounts. All except the tax deficiencies remain outstanding.\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s overarching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6\n2(c), the entire process is a scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole\nperson concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available, reliable\ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a\ndecision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\n\n4\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of\nthe possible risk an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \nAnalysis\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nUnder this guideline, \u201cfailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts,\nand meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about\nan individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information\u201d (AG\n\u00b6 18). Moreover, \u201can individual who is financially overextended is at risk of having to\nengage in illegal acts to generate funds\u201d (Id.).\nHere, Applicant\u2019s financial problems trigger the applicability of AG & 19(a), \u201can\ninability or unwillingness to satisfy debts,@ AG & 19(c), Aa history of not meeting financial\nobligations,\u201d and AG \u00b6 19(e), \u201cconsistent spending beyond one\u2019s means, which may be\nindicated by excessive indebtedness, significant negative cash flow, high debt-to-\nincome ratio, and/or other financial analysis.\u201d\nApplicant\u2019s history of delinquencies span more than seven years, and all remain\noutstanding. AG \u00b6 20(a), \u201cthe behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or\noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt\non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment,\u201d does not apply.\nAlthough Applicant\u2019s financial indebtedness was exacerbated by the loss of his\nfirst mobile home and several personal belongings in a fire, and the subsequent\n\n5\nincapacitation of his wife which temporarily rendered her unable to work, AG \u00b6 20(b),\n\u201cthe conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s\ncontrol (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical\nemergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the individual acted responsibly\nunder the circumstances), does not apply. Both income tax delinquencies in addition to\ntwo other delinquencies were accrued before the fire. Moreover, he continued to accrue\ndelinquencies and did not seek a credit repair agent until nearly six years after the fire.\nAlthough Applicant\u2019s retention of a credit repair agency to help him resolve his\ndelinquencies triggers the application of AG \u00b6 20(d), \u201cthe individual initiated a good-faith\neffort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts,\u201d it does not trigger the\napplication of AG \u00b6 20(c), \u201cthe person has received or is receiving counseling, and/or\nthere are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control.\u201d None\nof the record evidence indicates that the credit agent will actually provide money\nmanagement counseling. Absent such counseling, I cannot conclude that the problem is\nunder control. Applicant has not mitigated the financial considerations security concern.\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness\nof the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include\nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which participation\nis voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent\nbehavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure,\ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d\nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security\nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration\nof the guidelines and the whole person concept.\nBetween 1999 and 2007, Applicant accrued approximately $60,000 of\ndelinquencies. Although the mobile home fire exacerbated his financial problems, it has\nlimited probative value (see discussion in Financial Considerations section, supra). \nNearly all of Applicant\u2019s delinquencies remain outstanding. Although he retained\na credit agent to assist him in repairing his credit, he did so approximately five months\nafter the government sent him interrogatories placing him on notice about its concern\nwith his finances. Consequently, it is too soon to conclude his financial problems are\nunder control. Evaluating this case in light of the whole person concept, I conclude he\nhas not mitigated the financial considerations security concern. Clearance is denied.\n\n6\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 1.a - 1.k:\nAgainst Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.

Hess, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro se \n______________\nDecision\n______________\nMASON, Paul J., Administrative Judge:\nApplicant submitted his Security Clearance Application (SCA), on October 16,\n2006. On September 16, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA)\nissued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security concerns under financial\nconsiderations (Guideline F). The action was taken pursuant to Executive Order 10865,\nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended;\nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security\nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised\nadjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and\nmade effective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued on or after\nSeptember 1, 2006. \nApplicant submitted his answer to the SOR on October 11, 2007. DOHA issued a\nnotice of hearing on December 3, 2007, and the hearing was held on December 17,\n2007. At the hearing, five exhibits (AE 1 through 5) were admitted in evidence without\nobjection to support the government\u2019s case. Applicant\u2019s six exhibits (AE A through AF)\nwere received in evidence without objection. Applicant testified. In the time allowed for\npost-hearing submissions, Applicant submitted 37 documents that have also been\nMarch 6, 2008\n\n The agreement was signed by an official of State Y bank on January 3, 2008. (AE G)\n1\n2\nreceived in evidence without objection. (AE G through AE I). The exhibits address (1)\nApplicant\u2019s deficiency agreement (SOR 1.g., 1.h.) he entered into with State X bank on\nDecember 26, 2007,  (2) performance evaluations and character references, (3) and a\n1\nfive-year debt plan, including his plan to pay off the other SOR debts. DOHA received a\ncopy of the hearing transcript on January 7, 2008. Based upon a review of the case file,\npleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility for access to classified information is\ngranted. \nRulings on Procedure\nDuring the hearing, Department Counsel made a motion to amend the SOR by\nre-lettering the last two allegations. Applicant had no objection. Pursuant to E3.1.17. of\nthe Directive, the motion was granted, and the last two allegations of page two of the\nSOR were re-lettered to read \u201c1.l.\u201d and \u201c1.m.\u201d (Tr. 35-36)\nFindings of Fact\nThe SOR alleges financial considerations. Applicant admitted SOR 1.a., 1.f., 1.h.,\n1.l. and 1.m. He denied SOR 1.b., 1.c., 1.d., 1.e., 1.g., 1.i., and 1j. Applicant\u2019s interview\nin January 2007 (GE 2) and his credit bureau reports reflect that all debts are his\nresponsibility. He is 59 years old, divorced, and has been employed as a senior cost\nengineer with a defense contractor since September 2005. GE 1 reflects that Applicant\nwas a senior cost engineer (with a security clearance) for a defense contractor in State\nY from October 1974 to February 2000, and from October 2002 to December 2004, with\na second defense contractor. He seeks a security clearance. \nFrom February 2000 until October 2003, Applicant formed a real estate\npartnership with another realtor. He continued to sell real estate part-time for about a\nyear after he began working for the second defense contractor in October 2002. \nHaving made a decision in December 2004 that he needed to take a respite from\nthe defense contractor field, he resigned his employment with the second defense\ncontractor, and resumed his real estate career in a foreign country (FC). Before his\nresignation, he entered into a purchase agreement with a buyer and State Y bank to\nbuy his home and another parcel of land. The two parcels of land are listed in SOR 1.g.\nand 1.h. respectively. See also GE 2. On one of the parcels of land was a mobile home\nthat Applicant valued at $10,000.00, and a truck and an office trailer he valued at\n$2,000.00, for a total of $12,000.00. \nApplicant entered into a second agreement with State Y bank for money to be\ntaken out of his private account for the payment of bills, e.g., credit cards and utilities,\nwhile he was in FC selling real estate. \n\n Applicant was unable to return to State Y immediately due to his employment obligations in FC. \n2\n The judgment includes interest, fees, costs and expenses. (GE 2) \n3\n3\nWithin four months of his departure from the second defense contractor to sell\nreal estate in FC, Applicant was notified by State Y bank in March 2005 that the buyer\nhad defaulted on the purchase agreement for both properties. After receiving\ndelinquency notices in April 2005 for nonpayment of several of the SOR debts,\nApplicant discovered the bank had exhausted his private account (created by the\nsecond agreement he had with State Y bank) to pay the mortgage following default. \nApplicant returned to State Y in September 2005  to weigh his options (including\n2\nbankruptcy) for his properties, that were about to go into foreclosure. Initially, Applicant\nwas advised by an attorney not to address the other SOR debts because this action\ncould constitute a waiver of the bank\u2019s potential liability for withdrawing funds for the\nmortgage rather than the other SOR debts. He provided this explanation during the\nhearing. (Tr. 40) After learning in late 2005 he had no redress against the bank for\ntaking funds to pay the mortgage, and concluding he had insufficient funds to pay off the\narrearage on the mortgage (GE 2, e-mails in September 2006 between Applicant and\nthe bank), the property was foreclosed on. On October 18, 2006, the property securing\nthe bank\u2019s mortgage went on sale through a public auction. \nThe actual sale of Applicant\u2019s property on December 7, 2006 resulted in a\ndeficiency judgment of $29,717.00.  (Tr. 26) Applicant told the government investigator\n3\nin January 2007 that he did not intend to address the other SOR creditors until he\ncompleted his negotiations with the bank regarding the deficiency judgment. Applicant\nand State Y bank presented offers and counter offers until November 28, 2007, when\nthe bank proposed a compromise that became the stipulated deficiency agreement. (AE\nG) Under the terms of the deficiency judgment agreement, Applicant agreed to pay the\nbank $300.00 a month for 60 months, with payments beginning in January 2008.\nAnother term of the agreement is that if Applicant does not make all required payments\non or before the scheduled due dates, \u201cthe amount of the deficiency will revert back to\nthe full amount awarded under the deficiency judgment, plus accrued interest, less any\namounts received from [Applicant].\u201d (AE G)\nThere are 12 delinquent accounts in the SOR, including the deficiency judgment\nagreement. The total sum of the delinquency is $49,300.00. The deficiency judgment\n(SOR 1.g. and 1.h., $29,717.00) amounts to more than half of the SOR debt. Almost all\nof the debts became overdue between September 2004 and February 2005. Applicant\nhas incurred no new debt since February 2005 (GE 3), not 2004 as he testified. (Tr. 44)\nSave for the government credit card, he has no credit cards currently. He officially\ncontacted all creditors on November 28, 2007 for delinquent debt information and plans\nto pay the outstanding balance on the other debts by June 2008. (Tr. 28; AE G) \nApplicant has been using a budget in handling his finances since January 2007.\n(GE 2) The budget reveals a monthly net remainder of $1,265.00. (AE E)\n\n4\nApplicant submitted a character questionnaire to seven supervisors and\ncoworkers (AE F) The questionnaire asks a series of questions about Applicant\u2019s\ncharacter on the job. All indicated they recommended him for a position of trust. \nThe manager of Applicant\u2019s division stated that Applicant mentioned his financial\nproblems when he was hired in September 2005. The manager recalled Applicant was\nvery active in several community projects in finding shelter and food for the homeless\nafter the hurricane passed through the area in September 2005. Another cost engineer\nadmires Applicant\u2019s contributions in reestablishing critical connections between his\nemployer and the local military installations after the hurricane. The Director of a major\nlocal youth organization commended Applicant for organizing renovation efforts in the\ncommunity after the hurricane in September 2005. Applicant\u2019s job ratings for the last\ntwo years show he has met performance expectations.\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are flexible rules of law. Recognizing the complexities of human\nbehavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the\nadjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s ultimate adjudicative goal is a fair,\nimpartial and common sense decision. According to the AG, the entire process is a\ncareful, thorough evaluation of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole person\nconcept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available, reliable information\nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2b.\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship\n\n5\nis not restricted to normal duty hours. Rather, the relationship is an-around-the-clock\nresponsibility between an applicant and the federal government. The government\nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to\nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk\nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified\ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation\nas to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information.\nFinancial Considerations (FC)\nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, and inability to pay bills on time places the\nindividual debtor at risk of committing illegal acts to generate funds. \nAnalysis\nWhen the SOR was published in September 2007, Applicant was over\n$49,000.00 in debt, with more than 50% of the debt attributed to his defaulted mortgage\nand other property. On hindsight, he should have returned to State X to confront his\ngrowing debt much sooner than he did. FC disqualifying condition (DC) 19.a. (inability or\nunwillingness to satisfy debts) and FC DC 19.c. (a history of not meeting financial\nobligations) apply. FC DC 19.a. applies due to Applicant\u2019s inability to address the debt.\nApplicant\u2019s \u201cunwillingness\u201d to satisfy all but two of the remaining debts is a reasonable\ninference that is drawn from his statement in January 2007 that he was unwilling to deal\nwith the other SOR creditors. However, the reason for his unwillingness was his\nconcern over how to address the large deficiency judgment of $29,717.00 that was\nentered against him in December 2006. FC DC 19.c. applies based on a history, albeit\nshort, of not paying the delinquent debts. \nThe circumstances of this case potentially raise the first four mitigating conditions\n(MC) under the FC guideline. FC MC 20.a. (the behavior happened so long ago, was so\ninfrequent, or occurred under the such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and\ndoes not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good\njudgment) applies in part. The 12 listed debts fell delinquent in a short time span in 2004\nand early 2005, without any additional debt showing up since February 2005. The\ndeficiency agreement between Applicant and State Y bank is now in place, allowing\nApplicant to implement the second portion of his plan to eliminate his remaining,\ndelinquent creditors by June 2008. \nApplicant receives limited mitigation under FC MC 20.b. (the conditions that\nresulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s control and the\nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances) because Applicant had no way of\nknowing the purchaser was going to default on the mortgage only four months after the\npurchase agreement was signed. However, the timing of the default suggests Applicant\nshould have devoted more effort in selecting a qualified candidate to purchase the\nproperties. Notwithstanding the default after only four months, Applicant is entitled to\nlimited mitigation under FC MC 20. b.\n\n6\nFC MC 20. c. (the individual has received or is receiving counseling for the\nproblem and/or there are clear indications the problem is being resolved or is under\ncontrol) applies in part even though Applicant has received no financial counseling. He\nlocated all of his listed creditors, and executed a plan for paying off the deficiency\njudgment. Putting the five-year plan in place on January 3, 2008 will allow him to\nexpedite his second plan to resolve the remaining debts, hopefully by June 2008.\nFC MC 20.d. (the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors\nor otherwise resolve debt) also applies on a limited basis due to Applicant\u2019s action in\nresolving the deficiency judgment with State Y bank. Rather than succumbing to the\ntemptation of a bankruptcy discharge of all of his debts, Applicant chose to negotiate\nwith State Y bank in 2006 until November 28, 2007. He realizes a breach of one of the\nterms of the deficiency agreement will mean he will have to pay the original deficiency\njudgment of $29,717.00, rather than $18,000.00 under the agreement. The limited\nmitigation Applicant receives under all four conditions satisfies his ultimate burden of\npersuasion under each factual allegation and the FC guideline. \nWhole Person Concept (WPC)\nMy finding for Applicant under the FC guideline must still be evaluated in the\ncontext of nine variables known as the whole person concept. In evaluating the\nrelevance of an individual\u2019s conduct, the administrative judge should consider the\nfollowing factors: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the\nfrequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time\nof the conduct; (5) the extent to which the participation was voluntary; (6) the presence\nor absence of rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9)\nthe likelihood of continuation or recurrence. Applicant was 55 years old when he\nresigned his job as a cost consultant for a defense contractor, and moved to FC to sell\nreal estate. He also viewed the career change as a chance to take some time off. It is\nobvious the mortgage default and foreclosure on the properties would not have\noccurred had he selected a more qualified purchaser. Rather than yielding to the\nChapter 7 route of eliminating the deficiency judgment and his SOR debt delinquencies,\nhe negotiated with the bank over a year and successfully worked out an agreement that\nobligates him for the next five years. In that period, I am confident he will also meet the\nremainder of his obligations under the SOR. He is 59 years old with almost 30 years in\nthe defense contractor industry. He has successfully met his job performance standards\nwith his current employer since September 2005. He is highly regarded by his\ncoworkers, supervisors, and friends, for his productivity on the job, as well as his work\nto revitalize the community after the hurricane in September 2005. The FC guideline is\nresolved in Applicant\u2019s favor. \n\n7\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1 (Financial Considerations, Guideline F): FOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a.\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b.\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c.\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d.\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e.\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.f.\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.g.\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.h.\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.i.\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.j.\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.k.\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.l.\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.m.\nFor Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.

The action was taken under \nExecutive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February \n20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial \nPersonnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended \n(Directive), and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President \non December 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for SORs \nissued after September 1, 2006.  \n  \n \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on January 17, 2008, and requested a \nhearing before an Administrative Judge. The case was assigned to me on February 19, \n2008. DOHA issued a Notice of Hearing on February 26, 2008, and I convened the \nhearing as scheduled on March 18, 2008. The government offered Exhibits (GE) 1 \nthrough 4, which were received without objection. Applicant testified on her own behalf, \nApril 22, 2008\n\n \n \n \n \n2\nand submitted Exhibits (AE) A through D, which were received without objection. DOHA \nreceived the transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on March 28, 2008.  \n \nProcedural and Evidentiary Rulings \n \nRequest for Administrative Notice \n \nDepartment Counsel submitted a formal request that I take administrative notice \nof certain facts relating to Lebanon and Jordan. Applicant did not object. The request \nand the attached documents were not admitted into evidence but were included in the \nrecord as HE I through XXII. The facts administratively noticed are set out in the \nFindings of Fact, below.  \n \nMotion to Amend SOR \n \nDepartment Counsel submitted a motion to amend the SOR by changing \n\u201cLebanon\u201d and \u201cLebanese\u201d in SOR \u00b6 1.a to \u201cJordan\u201d and \u201cJordanian.\u201d Applicant did not \nobject and the motion was granted. The motion and Applicant\u2019s response were marked \nHE XXIII and XXIV. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant is a 33-year-old employee of a defense contractor. She was born in the \nUnited States of a Jordanian father and a Lebanese mother while her father was \nattending an American university. Her parents took her to Lebanon in 1975, where she \nlived until 1976. She lived in Saudi Arabia with her parents from 1976 to 1991. She \nreturned to the United States in 1991, before she turned 17, to attend college. She \ngraduated in four years with a bachelor\u2019s degree. She went to Lebanon in 1995 to \nattend graduate school, and obtained a master\u2019s degree. She returned to the United \nStates in 1999, and has lived here since her return. She has never been married and \nhas no children.1 \n \n \nApplicant obtained a Jordanian passport in 1990, when she was 15 years old, in \norder to visit her grandmother in Lebanon. At the time there were travel restrictions for \nU.S. citizens. The passport expired in 1995, but was renewed to 2000. Applicant never \nused the passport to travel to Lebanon, or any other country. The passport has not been \nrenewed since it expired in 2000. Applicant never lived in Jordan. She never truly felt \nlike she was a Jordanian citizen, but she acknowledged that her acquiring the passport \nwas an exercise of Jordanian citizenship. She testified that she would be willing to \nrelinquish her Jordanian citizenship.2  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s father is a citizen of Jordan and her mother is a citizen of Lebanon. \nThey both are U.S. permanent residents. Her parents own a house in Jordan and they \nhave a condominium and an apartment in Lebanon. They may also have commercial \nproperty in Jordan. Her parents split their time between Lebanon, Jordan, and the \n                                                          \n1 Tr. at 27-30, 39-44, 47, 66; GE 1-4. \n \n2 Tr. at 27-33, 64-66, 84-86; GE 1-4. \n\n \n \n \n \n3\nUnited States. She estimates they spend on average about two months per year in \nLebanon, six months in Jordan, and the rest of the year in the U.S. Her father is 67 \nyears old and her mother is 66 years old. Her father is a physician. Her mother was a \nteacher. They are both retired.3 \n \n \nApplicant has three sisters and a brother. Her oldest sister was born in Saudi \nArabia when her father was working there. She became a U.S. citizen in 2002. Her \nhusband is also a U.S. citizen. She has lived in the U.S. for about 11 years. They have \nchildren who are U.S. citizens. Applicant\u2019s second oldest sister married a citizen of the \nUnited Kingdom, and she became a U.K. citizen. They currently live in Kuwait. He is a \ncollege professor. They have a child who is a U.K. citizen. Applicant\u2019s younger brother \nis a citizen and resident of Jordan. He attended college in the United States and \nreturned to Jordan after he graduated. He is employed in a commercial industry. Her \nyoungest sister is also a citizen and resident of Jordan. She was working for a private \ncompany. Applicant is unsure if her sister is still working for the same company. \nApplicant maintains periodic telephone contact with two aunts in Lebanon. None of \nApplicant\u2019s family members have any direct connection to a foreign government or to \nany terrorist organization. Applicant sponsored her family for permanent residence \nstatus in the U.S. She hopes that they become U.S. citizens but the process has taken \nlonger than anticipated.4  \n \n \nApplicant visited her parents in Saudi Arabia in 1999. She visited Lebanon in \n2000, and Lebanon and Jordan in July to August 2001. She visited the U.K. in 2002. \nApplicant visited Canada in 2006. She had a clearance at the time and fully reported her \ntravel to her security officer. She has not returned to any Middle Eastern country since \nSeptember 11, 2001.5 \n \n \nApplicant worked for a foreign embassy in the U.S. from about 2000 to 2004. It is \nnot one of the countries already discussed in this decision. Her job was to assist citizens \nof that country who were students in the United States. As an Arabic speaker who \nattended college in the United States, Applicant shared some common experiences with \nthe students. She had no dealings with the Ambassador. There are no indications that \nApplicant had any dealings with this country before or after she worked at the embassy. \nHer current job heavily relies on her ability to speak Arabic. She maintained an interim \nclearance without incident until it was withdrawn. Her job is contingent upon her \nobtaining a clearance. Applicant plans on remaining in the United States, but candidly \nadmitted that if she lost her job and could not find another one in the U.S., that she \nwould expand her search overseas. She does not anticipate inheriting any of her \nparent\u2019s property in Lebanon and Jordan because it is customarily passed to a male \nheir. Applicant\u2019s estimates the value of her assets in the U.S. at $110,000. She has no \nforeign assets.6  \n                                                          \n \n3 Tr. at 33-36, 41, 80-82, 86-88; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 1-4. \n \n4 Tr. at 36-38, 44-54, 68-69; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 1-4. \n \n5 Tr. at 53-54; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 1-4. \n \n6 Tr. at 56-63, 80-81, 87-88; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 1-4. \n\n \n \n \n \n4\n \nCharacter letters from Applicant\u2019s supervisor and co-workers attest that she is a \ntrusted employee and highly regarded colleague. Her science background and \nlanguage ability proved very valuable in her projects involved in the Global War on \nTerrorism. They state she is hard-working, conscientious, intelligent, honest, \nprofessional, competent, dedicated, diligent, and discrete. She is described as \u201ca lady of \ngreat character, integrity and loyalty, and takes great pride in serving and protecting our \nnation everyday.\u201d She is highly recommended for a security clearance.7 \n \nLebanon \n \n \nLebanon is a parliamentary republic. The U.S. has traditionally had close ties \nwith Lebanon, and it seeks to help preserve Lebanon\u2019s independence, sovereignty, \nnational unity, and territorial integrity.  \n \n \nLebanon does not recognize Israel and has technically been in a state of war \nwith Israel since its establishment. Its foreign policy and internal policies have been \nheavily influenced by Syria after the entry of Syrian troops into Lebanon in March 1976.  \nEven after the withdrawal of Syrian troops in April 2005, Syria continued to conduct \nintelligence activities in Lebanon and to exercise a strong influence on Lebanese \npolitics. \n \n \nSyria, designated by the U.S. as a state sponsor of terrorism, provides political \nand material support to Hizballah, the most prominent terrorist group in Lebanon.  \nHizballah has been designated by the U.S. as a foreign terrorist organization, closely \nconnected to Iran and a strong ally of Syria in advancing its political objectives in \nLebanon. Hizballah supports numerous violent anti-Western groups and is known to \nhave been involved in numerous anti-U.S. and anti-Israel terrorist attacks. It initiated a \nmilitary confrontation with Israel in July-August 2006, jeopardizing the long-term stability \nof Lebanon and complicating U.S.-Lebanese relations as the U.S. strived to support \nIsrael\u2019s right of self defense without abandoning its efforts to support rebuilding of \ndemocratic institutions in Lebanon. Between 1996 and 2004, Hizballah received \nfinancial support from a global criminal enterprise operating in Lebanon, Canada, China, \nBrazil, Paraguay, and the U.S.  \n \nAccording to the U.S. Department of State Report on Human Rights Practices, \nLebanese security forces arbitrarily arrested and detained individuals and there were \ninstances of arbitrary or unlawful deprivation of life, torture, and other abuse. Militias \nand non-Lebanese forces operating outside the area of central government authority \nfrequently violated citizens\u2019 privacy rights. Various factions also used informer networks \nand monitoring of telephones to obtain information regarding their perceived \nadversaries. During the year before the conflict broke out, the government took \nsignificant steps to increase freedom of assembly and association at mass \ndemonstrations and by facilitating the formation of new political associations and \nparties. The government also took concrete measures to prevent unauthorized \neavesdropping on private citizens. \n \n                                                          \n \n7 AE A-D. \n\n \n \n \n \n5\nJordan \n \n \nJordan is a constitutional monarchy with a developing economy and a modern \ninfrastructure. Jordan has followed a pro-western foreign policy and has had close \nrelations with the U.S. for more than four decades.  \n \nThe Jordanian government respects human rights in some areas, but its overall \nrecord continues to reflect some problems. Problems include: torture, arbitrary arrest, \nprolonged detention, denial of due process, infringement on citizen\u2019s privacy rights, \npolitical detainees, and restrictions on freedom of speech, press, assembly, association, \nand movement.  \n \nUnder Jordanian law any male relative may prevent a woman or child from \nleaving Jordan by placing a hold on their travel with the Jordanian authorities, even if \nthey are U.S. citizens. Jordanian law applies to dual U.S.-Jordanian citizens. \n \nThe Jordanian government publicly condemned terrorist acts throughout the \nworld, practiced strict security measures, passed new anti-terror legislation, and \ndisrupted several terrorist plots. Despite Jordan\u2019s aggressive pursuit of terrorists, the \nthreat of terrorism remains high in Jordan. Al-Qaida has focused terrorist activities \nagainst Jordan and U.S. interests in Jordan. Terrorist organizations have targeted the \nU.S. for intelligence through human espionage and by other means. International \nterrorist groups have conducted intelligence operations as effectively as state \nintelligence services. \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n\n \n \n \n \n6\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n \n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline C, Foreign Preference \n \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Foreign Preference is set out in \nAG \u00b6 9: \n \nWhen an individual acts in such a way as to indicate a preference for a \nforeign country over the United States, then he or she may be prone to \nprovide information or make decisions that are harmful to the interests of \nthe United States. \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 10. Two are potentially applicable in this case:   \n \n(a) exercise of any right, privilege or obligation of foreign citizenship after \nbecoming a U.S. citizen or through the foreign citizenship of a family \nmember. This includes but is not limited to: \n \n(1) possession of a current foreign passport;  \n \n (b) action to acquire or obtain recognition of a foreign citizenship by an \nAmerican citizen. \n \n \nApplicant possessed a Jordanian passport while a U.S. citizen. The passport \nexpired in 2000. AG \u00b6 10(a) was applicable. The possession of the Jordanian passport \n\n \n7 \n \nwhile a U.S. citizen could raise concerns under AG \u00b6 10(b), as an action to obtain \nrecognition of her Jordanian citizenship.  \n \nConditions that could mitigate Foreign Preference security concerns are provided \nunder AG \u00b6 11: \n \n(a) dual citizenship is based solely on parents\u2019 citizenship or birth in a \nforeign country; \n \n(b) the individual has expressed a willingness to renounce dual \ncitizenship; \n \n(c) exercise of the rights, privileges, or obligations of foreign citizenship \noccurred before the individual became a U.S. citizen or when the \nindividual was a minor; \n \n(d) use of a foreign passport is approved by the cognizant security \nauthority; \n \n(e) the passport has been destroyed, surrendered to the cognizant \nsecurity authority, or otherwise invalidated; and \n \n(f) the vote in a foreign election was encouraged by the United States \nGovernment. \n \nApplicant never truly felt like she was a Jordanian citizen, but she acknowledged \nthat she was able to obtain a passport from Jordan because her father was a citizen of \nJordan, which amounted to an exercise of Jordanian citizenship. AG \u00b6 11(a) does not \ntotally apply because she actively sought recognition of her Jordanian citizenship. AG \u00b6 \n11(b) is applicable because she expressed a willingness to renounce her Jordanian \ncitizenship. Applicant first obtained the passport when she was a minor, but renewed it \nas an adult. AG \u00b6 11(c) is partially applicable. The passport has been expired for eight \nyears and Applicant does not intend to renew it or obtain another one. AG \u00b6 11(e) is \napplicable.  \n \nGuideline B, Foreign Influence \n \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Foreign Influence is set out in \nAG \u00b6 7: \n \nForeign contacts and interests may be a security concern if the individual \nhas divided loyalties or foreign financial interests, may be manipulated or \ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a \nway that is not in U.S. interests, or is vulnerable to pressure or coercion by \nany foreign interest. Adjudication under this Guideline can and should \nconsider the identity of the foreign country in which the foreign contact or \nfinancial interest is located, including, but not limited to, such \n\n \n8 \n \nconsiderations as whether the foreign country is known to target United \nStates citizens to obtain protected information and/or is associated with a \nrisk of terrorism. \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 7. Three are potentially applicable in this case:   \n \n(a) contact with a foreign family member, business or professional \nassociate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or resident in a \nforeign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of foreign \nexploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; \n \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual\u2019s obligation to \nprotect sensitive information or technology and the individual\u2019s desire to \nhelp a foreign person, group, or country by providing that information; and \n \n(e) a substantial business, financial, or property interest in a foreign \ncountry, or in any foreign-owned or foreign-operated business, which \ncould subject the individual to heightened risk of foreign influence or \nexploitation. \n \nApplicant\u2019s father is a citizen of Jordan. Her mother is a citizen of Lebanon. They \nboth have permanent residence status in the U.S. They are retired professionals and \ncan afford to travel and divide their time between Jordan, Lebanon, and the U.S. She \nhas three sisters and a brother. Her oldest sister is a U.S. citizen, as is her husband and \nchildren. She has a sister who is a citizen of the United Kingdom. She, along with her \nBritish husband and child currently live in Kuwait. Her younger brother and sister are \nboth citizens and residents of Jordan. Lebanon and Jordan continue to have human \nrights issues, and they both have been victimized by terrorists. This creates a \nheightened risk of foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion. \nIt also creates a potential conflict of interest. AG \u00b6\u00b6 7(a) and (b) have been raised by the \nevidence.  \n \nApplicant does not own any foreign assets. Her parents have homes and \nproperty in both Jordan and Lebanon. Applicant does not anticipate inheriting her \nparents\u2019 property in those countries. The fact that her parents own foreign property is \nnot sufficient to completely raise AG \u00b6 7(e), but it clearly is a factor for consideration in \nthis case. \n \nApplicant worked for a foreign embassy in the U.S. from about 2000 to 2004. \nThat could raise AG \u00b6 7(b) for consideration. Her job was to assist students and she \nhad very little contact with the diplomatic aspects of the embassy. It has been four years \nsince she worked for the embassy and there are no indications that Applicant had any \ndealings with this country before or after she worked at the embassy. Her contact with \nthis country through their embassy was merely as an employee who possessed \nspecialized language skills that made her marketable. \n\n \n9 \n \nConditions that could mitigate Foreign Influence security concerns are provided \nunder AG \u00b6 8:  \n \n(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in \nwhich these persons are located, or the positions or activities of those \npersons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be \nplaced in a position of having to choose between the interests of a foreign \nindividual, group, organization, or government and the interests of the \nU.S.; \n \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of \nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, group, government, or country is \nso minimal, or the individual has such deep and longstanding relationships \nand loyalties in the U.S., that the individual can be expected to resolve any \nconflict of interest in favor of the U.S. interest; \n \n(c) contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and \ninfrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign \ninfluence or exploitation; \n \n(d) the foreign contacts and activities are on U.S. Government business or \nare approved by the cognizant security authority; \n \n(e) the individual has promptly complied with existing agency requirements \nregarding the reporting of contacts, requests, or threats from persons, \ngroups, or organizations from a foreign country; and \n \n(f) the value or routine nature of the foreign business, financial, or property \ninterests is such that they are unlikely to result in a conflict and could not \nbe used effectively to influence, manipulate, or pressure the individual. \nApplicant was born in the United States, but spent a large part of her youth \noverseas. She returned to the U.S. in 1991, when she was still 16 years old, to attend \ncollege. She went to Lebanon in 1995 to attend graduate school. She has lived in the \nU.S. since 1999. Her parents are permanent residents of the United States, but divide \ntheir time between the United States, Jordan, and Lebanon. Her sister and her sister\u2019s \nfamily are U.S. citizens and residents. I find that Applicant has deep and longstanding \nrelationships and loyalties in the U.S. AG \u00b6 8(b) is partially applicable. Applicant has not \nhad contact with the foreign citizens from the embassy where she was employed since \nshe stopped working there in 2004. AG \u00b6 8(c) is applicable to her contacts with that \nembassy. No other mitigating condition is fully applicable. \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \n\n \n10 \n \nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which \nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and \nother permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.        \n \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant was born in the U.S. \nExcept for one year in Lebanon, she spent much of her youth in Saudi Arabia, where \nher father was working as a physician. She returned to the U.S. when she was 16 years \nold to attend college. She attended graduate school in Lebanon, but she has lived in the \nU.S. since 1999. She worked at a foreign embassy for about four years, using her \nlanguage skills and experience to assist students from that country who were attending \nschool in the U.S. She has not been in contact with that embassy or its personnel since \n2004. She has no loyalty toward this country. She has not traveled to any country in the \nMiddle East since before September 11, 2001. She is very well thought of at her current \nemployment, where her Arabic language skills are highly valued.  \n \n \nI considered the totality of Applicant\u2019s family ties to Lebanon and Jordan. \nLebanon is a parliamentary republic which traditionally has maintained close ties with \nthe United States. Jordan is a constitutional monarchy which has followed a pro-western \nforeign policy and has had close relations with the U.S. for more than four decades. \nHowever, Guideline B is not limited to countries hostile to the United States. \u201cThe United \nStates has a compelling interest in protecting and safeguarding classified information \nfrom any person, organization, or country that is not authorized to have access to it, \nregardless of whether that person, organization, or country has interests inimical to \nthose of the United States.\u201d8 The distinctions between friendly and unfriendly \ngovernments must be made with caution. Relations between nations can shift, \nsometimes dramatically and unexpectedly. Furthermore, friendly nations can have \nprofound disagreements with the United States over matters they view as important to \ntheir vital interests or national security. Finally, we know friendly nations have engaged \nin espionage against the United States, especially in the economic, scientific, and \ntechnical fields. Nevertheless, the nature of a nation\u2019s government, its relationship with \nthe U.S., and its human rights record are relevant in assessing the likelihood that an \napplicant\u2019s family members are vulnerable to government coercion. The risk of coercion, \n                                                          \n8 ISCR Case No. 02-11570 at 5 (App. Bd. May 19, 2004). \n\n \n11 \n \npersuasion, or duress is significantly greater if the foreign country has an authoritarian \ngovernment, a family member is associated with or dependent upon the government, or \nthe country is known to conduct intelligence operations against the U.S. Also very \nimportant is whether the foreign country is associated with a risk of terrorism. \n \n \n \nBoth Jordan and Lebanon have human rights issues and have been victimized \nby terrorism. The influence of Syria and the presence of Hizballah in Lebanon and Al-\nQaida in Jordan are serious concerns. However, Applicant has proven that she supports \nthe Global War on Terrorism, in which her language skills and science background have \nproven to be valuable assets. The Appeal Board has stated that \u201can applicant\u2019s proven \nrecord of action in defense of the U.S. is very important and can lead to a favorable \nresult for an applicant in a Guideline B case.\u201d9 The Appeal Board case is distinguishable \nfrom Applicant\u2019s case as it was discussing an applicant who performed dangerous work \nas a translator in Afghanistan, which is not what Applicant has done. Nonetheless, \nApplicant\u2019s work merits special consideration.  \n \nApplicant spent much of her youth in Saudi Arabia and attended graduate school \nin Lebanon, but the last nine years of her adult life have been in the U.S. Her parents \nspend a few months a year in Lebanon. They spend a longer time in Jordan and her \nbrother and sister live in Jordan, a country where Applicant has never lived. One sister \nand her family are U.S. citizens and residents. Applicant sponsored her other family \nmembers for permanent residence status and looks forward to them becoming U.S. \ncitizens. Her life, career, assets, and allegiance all lie in the U.S. After considering all \nthe evidence, including Applicant\u2019s candid and honest testimony and her valuable and \nhighly regarded work for her current employer, I am convinced that this country is best \nserved by granting Applicant a security clearance.  \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant has mitigated the Foreign Preference and Foreign Influence security \nconcerns. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline C:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline B:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 2.a-2.f: \n \nFor Applicant  \n \n \n                                                          \n9 ISCR Case No. 07-00034 at 2 (App. Bd.

FOREMAN\nAPPEARANCES\nFOR GOVERNMENT\nRay T. Blank, Jr., Esq., Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nWilliam C. Johnson, Jr., Esq.\nSYNOPSIS\nAfter Applicant was laid off from his job in August 2001, he decided to attend a community\ncollege for about four months, during which he was unemployed.  After college, he worked at several\nlow-paying jobs and used his credit cards for living expenses, accumulating eight delinquent debts\ntotaling about $16,846.  Since beginning his current job in February 2005, he has resolved three\nsmaller debts, but the remaining debts totaling more than $14,000 remain unresolved.  Recently, he\nborrowed about $28,000 to buy a new car, and he spent a $1,500 bonus on a high-definition\ntelevision.  Security concerns based on financial considerations are not mitigated.  Clearance is\ndenied.\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\n\n2\nOn August 9, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement\nof Reasons (SOR) detailing the basis for its preliminary decision to deny Applicant a security\nclearance. This action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information\nwithin Industry (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6,\nDefense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (Jan. 2, 1992), as amended and\nmodified (Directive); and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) approved by the President on\nDecember 29, 2005, and implemented effective September 1, 2006.  The SOR alleges security\nconcerns under Guideline F (Financial Considerations).\nApplicant answered the SOR through counsel on August 30, 2007, admitted one allegation\nwith an explanation and denied all others, and requested a hearing.  The case was assigned to me on\nOctober 10, 2007, and heard on October 30, 2007, as scheduled.  I kept the record open until\nNovember 16, 2007, to enable Applicant to submit additional documentary evidence.  DOHA\nreceived the transcript (Tr.) on November 9, 2007.  \nApplicant submitted additional evidence by facsimile transmission on November 16, 2007,\nand it has been admitted as Applicant\u2019s Exhibits (AX) C and D.  The facsimile cover sheet, cover\nletter, and certificate of service are attached to the record as Hearing Exhibit (HX) I.  Department\nCounsel\u2019s response is attached as HX II.  The record was closed on November 16, 2007. \nFINDINGS OF FACT\nApplicant\u2019s admissions in his answer to the SOR and at the hearing are incorporated into my\nfindings of fact.  I make the following findings:\nApplicant is a 38-year-old network security engineer for a defense contractor.  He served on\nactive duty in the U.S. Army from December 1987 to March 1992, and in the Army National Guard\nfrom March 1992 to December 1995.  He has never held a security clearance.\nApplicant worked at various jobs after his release from active duty.  In August 2001, he was\nlaid off from a job with a defense contractor.  He received about $2,000 in severance pay, and he\ndecided to use the money to attend a community college (Tr. 30).  He was not employed while in\ncollege.  He graduated in December 2001 (Tr. 31).  \nAfter college, Applicant worked at several low-paying part-time jobs, and he used his credit\ncards to pay living expenses (Tr. 31, 33-34).  He was taking care of his mother, who was in poor\nhealth, during this time (Tr. 21).  Between July 2001 and April 2004, seven credit card accounts,\nwith balances totaling about $16,846 were charged off as bad debts or placed for collection.  He\nstarted receiving telephone calls and letters regarding his delinquent debts, but he ignored them\nbecause he did not have the funds to pay them (Tr. 32-33).  \nApplicant\u2019s pay was garnished twice between February and September 2002 for delinquent\nstate taxes in amounts of $83 and $681.  He testified he requested that the taxes be collected by\ngarnishment (Tr. 58).  The delinquent taxes have been paid in full (Tr. 26; AX C).  \n\n3\nApplicant began his current job in February 2005, and he currently earns about $61,500 per\nyear.  He is unmarried and has no children (Tr. 52).  His current take-home pay is about $1,400 every\ntwo weeks (Tr. 48).  He has a student loan of about $6,625, on which payments are deferred (GX\n4 at 2).  \nApplicant testified the two credit card accounts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.e and 1.f were\ncompromised and have been paid off in full (Tr. 26, 42).  He produced evidence of 40 payments of\n$30 between December 28, 2005, and July 27, 2007 (AX B; AX D).  \nApplicant also testified the debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.h was paid in full, but he had no\ndocumentary evidence of payment (Tr. 26-27).  Regarding this debt, he testified, \u201cif I\u2019m not\nmistaken, I paid it off with cash or whatever, but if this is something that is on another credit report,\nthen obviously I\u2019m mistaken.\u201d (Tr. 46.)  His credit report dated September 28, 2007, reported the\ndebt as unpaid (GX 4 at 1).\nApplicant received an offer of settlement from the creditor alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.g, but he had\nnot accepted the offer or made any payments on the debt as of the date of the hearing (AX A; Tr. 44).\nHe testified he has asked his attorney to negotiate settlements of the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b,\nand 1.c, but no agreements had been reached as of the time of the hearing, and no payments had been\nmade (Tr. 26, 43, 59).\nThe evidence concerning the debts alleged in the SOR is summarized in the table below.\nSOR\nDebt\nAmount\nStatus\nEvidence\n1.a\nCredit Card\n$2,546\nUnpaid\nGX 4 at 1; Tr. 26, 43, 59\n1.b\nCredit Card\n$2,259\nUnpaid\nGX 4 at 1; Tr. 26, 43, 59\n1.c\nCredit Card\n$2,392\nUnpaid\nGX 4 at 2; Tr. 26, 43, 59\n1.d\nState Taxes\n$764\nPaid by garnishment\nAX C; Tr. 26\n1.e\nCredit Card\n$1,114\nSettled\nAX B; AX D; Tr. 39-40\n1.f\nCredit Card\n$966\nSettled\nAX B; AX D; Tr. 39-40\n1.g\nCredit Card \n$2,270\nUnpaid\nGX 4 at 2; Tr. 26, 43, 59\n1.h\nCredit Card\n$5,299\nClaimed to be paid, but\nno documentation\nGX 4 at 1; \nTr. 26-27, 44, 46\nIn 2005, Applicant  borrowed about $28,000 to buy a car (Tr. 48).  His monthly car payments\nare about $601, and his insurance is $328 per month.  His monthly rent, including utility payments,\nis $750.  He pays about $100-$130 per month for cable, internet, and telephone service, and about\n$125 for cell phone service (Tr. 51).  He has medical insurance, but he pays a co-payment for his\nmedications for high blood pressure, diabetes, and high cholesterol (Tr. 52).  He has about $870 per\nmonth for living expenses, food, and gasoline (Tr. 54-55).  He recently received a $1,500 bonus, and\nhe used it to purchase a high-definition television set (Tr. 53).\n\n4\nApplicant has never sought credit counseling services (Tr. 47).  He testified he did not realize\nhis financial record would affect his ability to obtain a clearance.  When he realized the importance\nof his financial record, he began making payments on the two debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.e and 1.f, and he\nasked his attorney to begin negotiating with his other creditors (Tr. 25-26).\nPOLICIES\n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d  Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S.\n518, 528 (1988).  As Commander in Chief, the President has \u201cthe authority to . . . control access to\ninformation bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently\ntrustworthy to occupy a position . . . that will give that person access to such information.\u201d  Id. at\n527.  The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants\neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with\nthe national interest to do so.\u201d  Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within\nIndustry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified.  Eligibility for a security clearance is\npredicated upon the applicant meeting the criteria contained in the Guidelines.  Each clearance\ndecision must be a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision based on the relevant and material\nfacts and circumstances, the whole person concept, the disqualifying conditions and mitigating\nconditions under each specific guideline, and the factors listed in AG \u00b6\u00b6 2(a)(1)-(9).\nA person granted access to classified information enters into a special relationship with the\ngovernment.  The government must be able to have a high degree of trust and confidence in persons\nwith access to classified information.  However, the decision to deny an individual a security\nclearance is not necessarily a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant.  See Exec. Or. 10865\n\u00a7 7.  It is merely an indication the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the\nSecretary of Defense have established for issuing a clearance.\nInitially, the government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the personal\nor professional history of the applicant which disqualify, or may disqualify, the applicant from being\neligible for access to classified information.  See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is\n\u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d  See v. Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth.,\n36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994).  The Guidelines presume a nexus or rational connection between\nproven conduct under any of the criteria listed therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability.  See\nISCR Case No. 95-0611 at 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).  \nOnce the government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial evidence, the\nburden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts.  See Directive \u00b6\nE3.1.15.  An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent with\nthe national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d  ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App.\nBd. Dec. 19, 2002).  \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of\ndenials.\u201d  Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b). \nCONCLUSIONS\nGuideline F (Financial Considerations)\n\n5\nThe concern under this guideline is as follows: \u201cFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s\nmeans, satisfy debts, and meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment,\nor unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about an\nindividual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information. An individual\nwho is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.\u201d  AG\n\u00b618.\nSeveral disqualifying conditions under this guideline could raise a security concern and may\nbe disqualifying in this case.  AG \u00b6 19(a) is raised where there is an \u201cinability or unwillingness to\nsatisfy debts.\u201d AG \u00b6 19(b) is a two-pronged condition that is raised where there is \u201cindebtedness\ncaused by frivolous or irresponsible spending and the absence of any evidence of willingness or\nintent to pay the debt or establish a realistic plan to pay the debt.\u201d  AG \u00b6 19(c) is raised when there\nis \u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations.\u201d  AG \u00b6 19(e) is raised when there is \u201cconsistent\nspending beyond one\u2019s means, which may be indicated by excessive indebtedness, significant\nnegative cash flow, high debt-to-income ratio, and/or other financial analysis.\u201d  AG \u00b6 19(g) is raised\nby \u201cfailure to file annual Federal, state, or local income tax returns as required or the fraudulent filing\nof the same.\u201d  \nApplicant\u2019s financial history raises AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a), (c), and (e).  AG \u00b6 19(b) is not raised,\nbecause his purchases of an expensive new car and a high-definition television set instead of paying\noff his delinquent debts, although frivolous and irresponsible, did not cause the debts alleged in the\nSOR.  AG \u00b6 19(g) is not raised because his delinquent taxes were the result of inability to pay rather\nthan failure to file or fraud.\nSince the government produced substantial evidence to raise the disqualifying conditions in\nAG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a), (c) and (e), the burden shifted to Applicant to produce evidence to rebut, explain,\nextenuate, or mitigate the facts.  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.  An applicant has the burden of proving a\nmitigating condition, and the burden of disproving it never shifts to the government.  See ISCR Case\nNo. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).  \nSeveral mitigating conditions are relevant to this case.  Security concerns based on financial\nproblems can be mitigated by showing that \u201cthe behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent,\nor occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the\nindividual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.\u201d  AG \u00b6 20(a).  This condition is\nnot established because Applicant\u2019s debts are numerous and not yet resolved.  His irresponsible\nassumption of additional debt for an expensive car and use of his bonus to buy a high-definition\ntelevision set reflect bad financial judgment and lack of financial discipline. \nSecurity concerns under this guideline also can be mitigated by showing that \u201cthe conditions\nthat resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of\nemployment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or\nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances.\u201d  AG \u00b6 20(b).  Both\nprongs, i.e., conditions beyond the person\u2019s control and responsible conduct, must be established.\nApplicant\u2019s loss of employment in 2001 was a circumstance beyond his control, and his\ndesire to attend college education was understandable.  It was not reasonable, however, for him to\n\n6\nbecome a full-time student with no means of financial support.  It also was not reasonable for him\nto ignore the telephone calls and letters from creditors instead of attempting to reach an\naccommodation.  I conclude AG \u00b6 20(b) is not established.\nSecurity concerns under this guideline also can be mitigated by showing that \u201cthe person has\nreceived or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or there are clear indications that the problem\nis being resolved or is under control.\u201d  AG \u00b6 20(c).  Applicant has never sought financial counseling.\nHe recently retained an attorney, but there are no \u201cclear indications\u201d that his financial problems are\nbeing resolved.  I conclude AG \u00b6 20(c) is not established.\nSecurity concerns under this guideline also can be mitigated by showing that \u201cthe individual\ninitiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.\u201d  AG \u00b6 20(d).\nApplicant requested that the delinquent taxes be collected by garnishment, and there is no indication\nof tax liens on his credit reports.  He settled and paid off the debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.e and 1.f in\ninstallments.  I conclude that a \u201cgood faith effort\u201d is established for these three debts.  On the other\nhand, he was vague and uncertain regarding the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.h, and he could produce no\ndocumentation to corroborate his assertion that the debt had been paid in full. His most recent credit\nreport contradicts his testimony.  Finally, he admitted that no settlement agreements have been\nreached and no payments made on the remaining debts.  I conclude AG \u00b6 29(d) is established only\nfor the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d, 1.e, and 1.f.\nWhole Person Analysis\nIn addition to considering the specific disqualifying and mitigating conditions under each\nguideline, I have also considered: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency\nand recency of the conduct; (4) the applicant\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the\nextent to which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other\npermanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure,\ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  AG \u00b6\u00b6\n2(a)(1)-(9).  \nApplicant is a mature, well-educated adult.  His unresolved debts are significant but not\ninsurmountable in light of his current income.  At the hearing, he appeared to lack clear\ncomprehension of his financial situation, and he is depending on his lawyer to resolve it.  Although\nhe resolved the debts in SOR \u00b6 1.e and 1.f after beginning his current job, he did so only after\nlearning that his debts could prevent him from obtaining a clearance.  He has never received any kind\nof credit counseling, and appears financially naive and undisciplined, as demonstrated by his recent\nhigh-dollar discretionary purchases in spite of his ongoing financial problems.  His financial record\nkeeping is spotty.  Although he has resolved some debts and obtained the assistance of a lawyer to\nresolve the remaining debts, he has not yet established a track record of financial responsibility.\nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under Guideline F, and evaluating\nall the evidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has not mitigated the\nsecurity concerns based on financial considerations.  Accordingly, I conclude he has not carried his\nburden of showing that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant him a security\nclearance.\n\n7\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nThe following are my conclusions as to each allegation in the SOR:\nParagraph 1. Guideline F (Financial):\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.f:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.g:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.h:\nAgainst Applicant\nDECISION\nIn light of all of the circumstances in this case, it is not clearly consistent with the national\ninterest to grant Applicant a security clearance. Clearance is denied.\nLeRoy F. Foreman\nAdministrative Judge\n",

His eligibility \nfor a security clearance is denied. \n \nApplicant submitted a Security Clearance Application (SF-86) on January 12, \n2007.  On June 9, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued \nApplicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns under \nGuideline D, Sexual Behavior, and Guideline E, Personal Conduct. The action was \ntaken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry \n(February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense \nIndustrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as \namended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the \nPresident on December 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for \nSORs issued after September 1, 2006.  \n  \nNovember 12, 2008\n\n \n2 \n \n \n \nOn June 23, 2008, Applicant answered the SOR in writing and elected to have a \nhearing before an administrative judge. The case was assigned to me on August 25, \n2008. I convened a hearing on September 29, 2008, to consider whether it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for \nApplicant.  The Government called no witnesses and introduced three exhibits, which \nwere marked Ex. 1 through 3 and admitted to the record without objection.  Applicant \ntestified on his own behalf, called no witnesses, and introduced three exhibits, which \nwere marked Exs. A, B, and C.  Applicant\u2019s Exs. A  and C were admitted to the record \nwithout objection.  Applicant\u2019s Ex. B was admitted to the record over the Government\u2019s \nobjection.   \n \nDOHA received the transcript (Tr.) of the hearing on October 3, 2008. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nThe SOR contains two allegations of disqualifying conduct under AG D, Sexual \nBehavior (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a. and 1.b.) and two allegations of disqualifying conduct under AG \nE, Personal Conduct (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.a. and 2.b.) In his Answer to the SOR, Applicant \nadmitted all allegations under AG D and AG E. Applicant\u2019s admissions are admitted \nherein as findings of fact.   \n \n \nApplicant is 35 years old and employed as a construction specialist by a \ngovernment contractor. From October 1991 to August 1996, he served in the U.S. \nmilitary. In approximately 1993, he was granted a security clearance and eligibility for \naccess to Sensitive Compartmented Information (SCI).  From September 1996 to May \n2004, Applicant was employed by government contractor A.  From 2004 until the \npresent, Applicant has been employed by government contractor B. (Ex. 1; Ex. 2; Tr. \n22, 45-47.) \n \n \nApplicant was married for the first time in December 1992, when he was 19 years \nold and stationed in a European country.  He married a young woman he had known \nbefore entering the military. He and his first wife separated in about September 1993, \nand she returned to the United States.  He and his wife divorced in April 1994.  (Tr. 41-\n44.  \n \n \nApplicant married for the second time in June 2001 while he was working \noverseas for government contractor A.  He married a woman who was a U.S. military \nservice member.  He and his second wife divorced in May 2004. (Ex. 1; Tr. 44.) \n \n \nBetween 1992 and 1996, while serving in the U.S. military, Applicant traveled to \napproximately 25 foreign countries in the course of carrying out his extended \nassignments.  The foreign countries were located in Europe, the former Soviet Union, \nand Asia.  While on these assignments, Applicant met and had sexual relationships with \nforeign nationals.  In an affidavit he signed November 30, 2007, Applicant described his \nrelationships with foreign national women as \u201ccasual and short term.\u201d He denied that his \nbehavior could be used to coerce or blackmail him.  At his hearing, he admitted that \n\n \n3 \n \n \nsome of his encounters with foreign national women involved paying for sexual \nintimacies.  He knew that paying for sex was illegal.  Between 1992 and 1996 and 2003 \nto 2006, as an active duty military member and as a government contractor, Applicant \nhad sexual relations with foreign nationals on more than 50 occasions.  (Tr. 22-24, 30.) \n \n \nAs a government contractor, Applicant was assigned to do work in China.  He \nwas told by his employer not to have any foreign contacts. He had sexual relations with \na woman in China who told him she was a foreign national from another Asian country.  \nApplicant reported the incident to a U.S. embassy official, but he did not report the \nincident to his employer\u2019s cognizant security officer.  (Tr. 27-29.)  \n \n \nApplicant and his second wife separated in June 2003, while he was employed in \na European country by employer A. After his separation, Applicant felt lonely and \nfrequented massage parlors in the European country and paid for sexual intimacies on \nseveral occasions.  He returned to the United States in April 2004. Between 2004 and \nJanuary 2006, he felt isolated because he was living in an area where he had no friends \nor family. He visited two massage parlors in the United States and paid for numerous \nsexual intimacies.  He also visited women for paid sex services who worked out of their \nhomes.  Additionally, he identified women for paid sex services by visiting an on-line \ncomputer service.  (Ex. 2; Tr. 29-30.) \n \n \nIn February 2006, Applicant met a woman through an internet dating service. In \nJuly 2006, Applicant underwent two polygraph examinations and an interview, as \nrequired by another government agency in order to have access to SCI.  In August \n2006, Applicant\u2019s security clearance and eligibility for access to SCI were revoked. \nApplicant and the woman began to cohabit in January 2007. (Ex. 2; Ex. B.) \n \n \nOn November 30, 2007, at the request of an authorized investigator from the \nOffice of Personnel Management, Applicant provided a signed affidavit relating some of \nhis sexual behavior. He gave the affidavit to his girlfriend to read, and she found his \nrevelations to be upsetting. In order to re-establish the girlfriend\u2019s trust, the couple \nattended eight sessions of relationship counseling over a period of about ten weeks. (Tr. \n37-40.) \n \n \nApplicant has had concerns that he has a sexual addiction. The issue was not \naddressed during the relationship counseling.  After the counseling ended, he discussed \nthe matter once on the telephone with the counselor he and his girlfriend consulted.  He \nhas not pursued any further individual counseling. He stated: \u201cI could never seek help \nbecause I could never tell anybody about it.\u201d  He does not now believe he has a sexual \naddiction.  (Tr.53-58.) \n \n \nIn April 2008, Applicant and his girlfriend became the parents of an infant \ndaughter.  They have plans to marry in the spring of 2009. Applicant has not told his \ngirlfriend that he paid foreign nationals for sex while he was at military stations.  She \nalso does not know that he had sex about 50 times with foreign nationals. (Tr. 40-41, \n51-52.) \n\n \n4 \n \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s supervisor at employer B provided a letter of character reference in \nwhich he stated his belief that Applicant was truthful and trustworthy in all respects.  \nApplicant did not reveal the content of the SOR allegations to his supervisor or to \nanyone else at employer B.   (Tr. 50-51, 62.) \n \n \nNeither Applicant\u2019s military command nor employer A knew of Applicant\u2019s sexual \ncontacts with foreign nationals. Applicant\u2019s work in the military took him to military \ninstallations and U.S. embassies around the world. Applicant acknowledged that he had \nreceived security awareness training and had been alerted that some foreign agents   \nemployed women to try to obtain classified information in exchange for sex.  Applicant \nignored the security admonitions and continued his sexual activity with foreign nationals. \nHe said his co-workers did the same. (Tr. 60-62.)   \n   \n                                                         Policies \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, the administrative judge applies these guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \nover-arching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. \nAccording to AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of \nvariables known as the \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \n\n \n5 \n \n \n                                           \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline D, Sexual Behavior \n \n \nAG \u00b612 identifies the government\u2019s concern with Guideline D, in pertinent part, \nas follows:  \n \nSexual behavior that involves a criminal offense, indicates a personality or \nemotional disorder, reflects lack of judgment or discretion, or which may \nsubject the individual to undue influence or coercion, exploitation, or \nduress can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness \nand ability to protect classified information \n \nDuring his military service, from 1992 to 1996, Applicant was assigned to \nextended military travel in Europe, the former Soviet Union, and Asia. While on these \nmilitary assignments, Applicant engaged in sexual liaisons with foreign national women. \nAgainst the advice of his security officer, he carried out a sexual encounter with a \nforeign national in China. In some instances, while assigned to military duty overseas, \nhe paid foreign national women for sexual intimacies. From 2003 to 2006, as a \ngovernment contractor, Applicant paid for sexual intimacies at massage parlors in a \nEuropean country and in the United States. He knew that paying for sex was illegal. In \nthe United States, he visited women in their homes for sexual intimacies, and he sought \nsexual relationships online. He carried out this behavior even though he had been \nbriefed by his security officers and warned about the possibility that high risk sexual \nliaisons of the kind he carried out could be used to subject him to undue influence, \ncoercion, or exploitation. Applicant\u2019s sexual behavior while assigned to military duty \noverseas and as a government contractor reflected lack of discretion and judgment.  I \nconclude that Applicant\u2019s sexual behavior raises security concerns under AG \u00b6\u00b6 13(a), \n13(b), 13(c), and 13(d).1 \n \n1 AG \u00b6 13(a) reads: \u201csexual behavior of a criminal nature, whether or not the individual has been \nprosecuted.\u201d  AG \u00b6 13(b) reads: \u201ca pattern of compulsive, self-destructive, or high risk sexual behavior \nthat the person is unable to stop or that may be symptomatic of a personality disorder.\u201d AG \u00b6 13(c) reads: \n\n \n6 \n \n \n                                                                                                                                            \n \nAn applicant might be able to mitigate Guideline D security concerns. If the   \nsexual \u201cbehavior occurred prior to or during adolescence and there is no evidence of \nsubsequent conduct of a similar nature,\u201d then AG \u00b6 14 (a) might apply. If \u201cthe sexual \nbehavior happened so long ago, so infrequently, or under such unusual circumstances, \nthat it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment,\u201d then AG \u00b6 14(b) might apply.  If \u201cthe behavior no \nlonger serves as a basis for coercion, exploitation, or duress,\u201d the AG \u00b6 14(c) might \napply.  Finally, if \u201cthe sexual behavior is strictly private, consensual, and discreet,\u201d then \nAG \u00b614 (d) might apply. Applicant was an adult when he carried out the sexual behavior \nthat raises security concerns. While he expressed concern that his behavior might \nreflect a sexual addiction, he also denied such an addiction. He did not seek an \nevaluation of his sexual behavior from a qualified professional counselor.  He stated: \u201cI \ncould never seek help because I could never tell anyone about it.\u201d  His sexual behavior \nwas indiscreet and reflected poor judgment. It was repetitive and involved taking high \nrisks that made him vulnerable to coercion, exploitation, or duress. I conclude that none \nof the Guideline D mitigating conditions apply to the facts of Applicant\u2019s case.   \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct  \n \n \nUnder the Personal Conduct guideline \u201c[c]onduct involving questionable \njudgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and \nregulations can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and \nability to protect classified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide \ntruthful and candid answers during the security clearance process or any other failure to \ncooperate with the security clearance process.\u201d  AG \u00b6 15 \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s high risk sexual behavior was in contravention of the security training \nprovided to him by his military commands and his government contractor employers.  \nHe purposefully concealed information about his sexual behavior from his commands \nand his employers. He also betrayed the trust of his girlfriend by failing to tell her the \nwhole truth about his sexual behavior. I have carefully considered all of the Personal \nConduct Disqualifying conditions. I have especially considered AG \u00b6 16(e), which reads  \nas follows: \u201cpersonal conduct, or concealment of information about one\u2019s conduct, that \ncreates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress, such as (1) engaging in \nactivities which, if known, may affect the person\u2019s personal, professional, or community \nstanding, or (2) while in another country, engaging in any activity that is illegal in that \ncountry or that is legal in that country but illegal in the United States and may serve as a \nbasis for exploitation by the foreign security or intelligence service or other group.\u201d \n \n \nApplicant was awarded a security clearance and eligibility for access to SCI.  He \nwas assigned abroad and entrusted with classified information.  He then engaged in \nhigh risk sexual behavior with foreign nationals that he kept secret and did not report to \n \n\u201csexual behavior that causes an individual to be vulnerable to coercion, exploitation, or duress.\u201d  AG \u00b6 \n13(d) reads: \u201csexual behavior of a public nature and/or that reflects lack of discretion or judgment.\u201d  \n\n \n7 \n \n \nhis security officers, making him vulnerable to exploitation, manipulation, or duress. The \nbehavior, paying for sexual intimacies, was illegal in the United States and could have \nserved as a basis for exploitation by foreign security or intelligence services or other \ngroups.  Accordingly, I conclude that AG \u00b616(e) is raised by the facts of Appellant\u2019s \ncase. \n  \n \n \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s disqualifying personal conduct might be mitigated if he \u201cmade prompt, \ngood-faith efforts to correct the omission, concealment, or falsification before being \nconfronted with the facts.\u201d AG \u00b6 17(a) Additionally, Applicant\u2019s disqualifying conduct \nmight be mitigated if he \u201chas taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate vulnerability to \nexploitation, manipulation, or duress.\u201d  AG  \u00b6 17(e) \n \n \n \nApplicant did not make prompt good faith efforts to correct his concealment.  He \nhas not addressed whether he has a sexual addiction that would lead future high-risk \nsexual behavior and a similar pattern of concealment.  I conclude that neither AG \u00b6 \n17(a) nor AG \u00b6 17(e) applies to the facts of Appellant\u2019s case. \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which \nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and \nother permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n  \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.        \n \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Over a 14-year period, from 1992 to \n1996 and from 2003 to 2006, Applicant disregarded the security training he received \nand carried out high risk sexual behavior in the United States, Europe, the former Soviet \nUnion, and China. He kept his actions secret and did not report them to his military \ncommands or his civilian employers. He deceived his fianc\u00e9e after seeking her trust.  \nHe failed to mitigate serious concerns about his credibility, reliability, trustworthiness, \nand ability to put the government\u2019s interests before his own in the protection of classified \ninformation.  AG \u00b6 2(a)(7).  \n\n \n8 \n \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant failed to mitigate the security concerns arising from his sexual \nbehavior and personal conduct. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline D:  \n \nAGAINST  APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:   \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.b:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.b:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n_________________ \nJoan Caton Anthony \nAdministrative Judge \n",

On September 26, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA)\nissued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns under Guideline F\nfor Applicant. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding\nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of\nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review\nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative\nguidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective\nwithin the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n \nApplicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on October 22, 2007, and elected to\nhave her case decided on the record in lieu of a hearing. Department Counsel\nsubmitted the Government\u2019s written case on November 9, 2007. Applicant received a\ncomplete file of relevant material (FORM) on November 26, 2007, and was provided the\nopportunity to file objections and submit material to refute, extenuate, or mitigate the\nFebruary 12, 2008\n\nThe Government submitted twelve items in support of its contentions.\n1\nItem 4 (Applicant\u2019s answer to SOR, dated October 22, 2007).\n2\nItem 6 (Security Clearance Questionnaire, dated January 16, 2006 ).\n3\nItem 12 (Applicant\u2019s sworn statement, dated October 13, 1993).\n4\nItem 11 (Garnishment Summons for Judgment, dated November 1991).\n5\nId.\n6\nItem 10 (Security Clearance Application, dated February 22, 2000).\n7\nId.\n8\nItem 5 (Letter from Applicant, dated January 18, 2006).\n9\n2\nGovernment\u2019s case.  Applicant did not submit additional information. The case was\n1\nassigned to me on January 31, 2008. Based upon a review of the case file, eligibility for\naccess to classified information is denied.\nFindings of Fact\nIn her Answer to the SOR, dated October 22, 2007, Applicant admitted the\nfactual allegations in \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.n, of the SOR.  \n2\nApplicant is a 37-year-old employee of a defense contractor who attends college\nclasses. She is divorced with one child. She has worked for her current employer since\nJanuary 2006.3\nIn October 1991 Applicant failed to pay her last month\u2019s rent on a one year\nlease.  She admits this was \u201cout of stupidity.\u201d Her landlord obtained a judgment against\n4\nApplicant in November 1991.  Applicant made no attempt to pay this amount until 1993\n5\nwhen it became an issue during a security clearance investigation.6\nIn 1997, Applicant fell behind on her payments for her Navy Exchange account.\nHer wages were garnished for approximately $1,000 until the debt was satisfied.7\nApplicant served in the U.S. Navy from 1993 until 2004.  After leaving the\n8\nmilitary, Applicant could not find employment. Her marriage ended in divorce in 2004.\nMoreover, she was unemployed from October 2004 until January 2005 and again from\nAugust 2005 until September 2005. She collected unemployment for a few unspecified\nmonths. She worked in a day care center for a few months but then left the position.  \n9\n\nId.\n10\nItem 7 (Credit Bureau Report).\n11\nItem 4 at 5-7.\n12\nItem 4 (Personal Financial Statement, dated October 10, 2007).\n13\nItem 5 (Letter from Applicant, dated January 2006).\n14\n3\nApplicant filed Chapter 7 bankruptcy in 2005.  However, her bankruptcy petition\n10\nwas dismissed in 2006. The record does not provide any pertinent information\nconcerning the bankruptcy. As a result of Hurricane Katrina, Applicant lost her job and\nwas forced to relocate. \nThe SOR alleges 12 delinquent debts. The total amount of debt is approximately\n$22,132.  Applicant acknowledges all the delinquent debts. She submitted paperwork\n11\nshowing that she has recently enrolled in a Debt Resolution Plan. The required monthly\npayments are $357.90 beginning on November 15, 2007.  Applicant did not provide\n12\nany evidence of payments on the debts under the debt resolution plan.\nApplicant\u2019s monthly net income is $3,193.67. Her total monthly expenses are\n$2,796. Her net remainder is $397.67.  \n13\nApplicant indicated in a letter in 2006 that she would contact a financial counselor\nbut there is no evidence in the record to support this contention.14\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2,\nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the\n\u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available, reliable\ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a\ndecision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\n\n4\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of\nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \nAnalysis\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set\nout in AG & 18:      \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to\nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended\nis at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under\nAG & 19(a), an Ainability or unwillingness to satisfy debts@ is potentially disqualifying.\nSimilarly under AG & 19(c), Aa history of not meeting financial obligations@ may raise\nsecurity concerns. Applicant accumulated delinquent debt and was unable to pay some\nobligations for a period of time. Her credit reports confirm that she has not paid the\ncharged off collection accounts. She filed bankruptcy in 2005 but the petition was\n\n5\ndismissed in 2006. Currently, she has approximately $22,130 in delinquent debt. The\nevidence is sufficient to raise these potentially disqualifying conditions, requiring a closer\nexamination.\nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security\nconcerns arising from financial difficulties. Under AG \u00b6 20(a), the disqualifying condition\nmay be mitigated where Athe behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or\noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt\non the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.@ Applicant=s\nmajor financial worries arose in 2004. She accumulated some delinquent debt due to\nher unemployment and a divorce. While the unemployment may have precipitated the\ndebt, the inquiry does not end at that point. The Applicant\u2019s problems have been\nongoing and she has not resolved the debts. Her inaction after being employed raise\nconcerns about her current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment. This potentially\nmitigating condition does not apply. \nUnder AG & 20(b), it may be mitigating where Athe conditions that resulted in the\nfinancial problem were largely beyond the person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a\nbusiness downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation),\nand the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances.@ As noted above, some of\nthe financial problems arose from her divorce, unemployment and lower income.\nHowever, she did not act responsibly in identifying and resolving her delinquent debts. I\nfind this potentially mitigating condition does not fully apply. \nEvidence that Athe person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem\nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control@\nis potentially mitigating under AG & 20(c). Similarly, AG & 20(d) applies where the\nevidence shows Athe individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or\notherwise resolve debts.@ Applicant has not received counseling and has only recently\n(November 2007) entered into a debt resolution plan to resolve the delinquent debts,\neither by payment or settlement. She is now financially sound and has a steady income.\nI conclude these potentially mitigating conditions do not apply.\nAG \u00b6 20(e) applies where the evidence shows \u201cthe individual has a reasonable\nbasis to dispute the legitimacy of the past due debt which is the cause of the problem\nand provides documented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides\nevidence of actions to resolve the issue.\u201d In this case, Applicant acknowledged the\ndelinquent debts were hers. I conclude this potentially mitigating condition does not\napply.\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness\n\n6\nof the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include\nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which participation\nis voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent\nbehavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure,\ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d\nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security\nclearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful\nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.       \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant served in the U.S. Navy\nfor a number of years. When she left the military, she had difficulty finding employment\nand her marriage dissolved in 2004. She had a son to provide for. Her unemployment\nand relocation due to Hurricane Katrina contributed to her financial problems. These\ncircumstances beyond her control exacerbated her difficulties but this is not an isolated\nincident. She had a judgment against her in 1991 which she did not address until 1993\nwhen her security clearance was on the line. And in 1997, her wages were garnished\nfor debt owed to her Navy exchange account. She did file for bankruptcy in 2005. This is\na legal way to resolve debt but the petition was dismissed in 2006. She did not enroll in\na debt resolution plan until November 2007. Applicant did not provide any evidence to\nshow that she acted responsibly in this situation because once she had stable\nemployment she did not start paying her delinquent debt. This raises concerns about\nher good judgment. Of course, the issue is not simply whether all her debts are paidBit\nis whether her financial circumstances raise concerns about her fitness to hold a\nsecurity clearance. Applicant has not shown sufficient effort to resolve her delinquent\ndebts. She has not met her burden of proof in this case to overcome the government\u2019s\ncase. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I\nconclude Applicant has not mitigated the security concerns arising from financial\nconsiderations. \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a-n:\nAgainst Applicant\n\n7\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.\n                                              \n_________________\nNOREEN A. LYNCH\nAdministrative Judge\n",

Applicant accumulated delinquent debt and was unable to pay some\nobligations for a period of time. His credit reports confirm that he has not paid the\ncharged off collection accounts. The activity for the delinquent debts ranges from 2002\nuntil the present. The evidence is sufficient to raise these potentially disqualifying\nconditions, requiring a closer examination.\nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security\nconcerns arising from financial difficulties. Under AG \u00b6 20(a), the disqualifying condition\nmay be mitigated where Athe behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or\noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt\non the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.@ Applicant=s\nfinancial worries arose between about 2002 and 2003. He accumulated some\ndelinquent debt due to unemployment and low salary. While the unemployment may\nhave precipitated the debt, the inquiry does not end at that point. The Applicant\u2019s\nproblems have been ongoing and he has not resolved the debts. His inaction after being\nemployed raise concerns about his current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.\nThis potentially mitigating condition does not apply. \nUnder AG & 20(b), it may be mitigating where Athe conditions that resulted in the\nfinancial problem were largely beyond the person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a\nbusiness downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation),\n\n5\nand the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances.@ As noted above, some of\nthe financial problems arose from his unemployment and lower income.

Similarly, AG & 20(d) applies where the\nevidence shows Athe individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or\notherwise resolve debts.@ Applicant has not received counseling and has not resolved\nthe delinquent debts, either by payment or settlement. He presented no evidence or\ndocumentation to support payment on any of his debts. He is now financially sound and\nprepared for future contingencies. He even has investment properties that he pays on\nmonthly.  I conclude these potentially mitigating conditions do not apply.\nAG \u00b6 20(e) applies where the evidence shows \u201cthe individual has a reasonable\nbasis to dispute the legitimacy of the past due debt which is the cause of the problem\nand provides documented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides\nevidence of actions to resolve the issue.\u201d In this case, Applicant disputed the sixth debt\nof $239. He did not produce any documentation to support this claim. I conclude this\npotentially mitigating condition does not apply.\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness\nof the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include\nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which participation\nis voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent\nbehavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure,\ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d\nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security\nclearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful\nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.       \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. When these problems first began,\nApplicant was under great stress and caring for his father. He accumulated debt due to\ncircumstances largely beyond his control, including unemployment and low income.\nHowever, he did not act responsibly under the circumstances because once he had\nstable employment he did not start paying his delinquent debt. He still has the\ndelinquent debt. He provided no documentation to support his claim that he is paying on\nsome of the debts. He is, however, paying more than $1,000 a month on his investment\n\n6\nproperties. He has been gainfully employed with his current employer since 2004.\nHowever, he has not taken affirmative action to pay or resolve most of the delinquent\ndebts raising concerns about his good judgment. Of course, the issue is not simply\nwhether all his debts are paidBit is whether his financial circumstances raise concerns\nabout his fitness to hold a security clearance. Applicant has not shown sufficient effort to\nresolve his delinquent debts. He has not met his burden of proof in this case to\novercome the government\u2019s case. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I\nconclude Applicant has not mitigated the security concerns arising from financial\nconsiderations. \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.f:\nAgainst Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.\n                                              \n_________________\nNOREEN A. LYNCH\nAdministrative Judge\n",

Jeffreys, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro Se\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nHOWE, Philip S., Administrative Judge:\nApplicant submitted his Security Clearance Application (SCA), on October 24,\n2005. On September 8, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA)\nissued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns under Guideline F\n(Financial Considerations) and Guideline E (Personal Conduct) for Applicant. The action\nwas taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within\nIndustry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6,\nDefense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as\namended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the\nPresident on December 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for\nSORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on October 5, 2007.  The Department\nCounsel requested a hearing before an Administrative Judge on November 5, 2007.\nDepartment Counsel was prepared to proceed on November 9, 2007, and I received the\ncase assignment on November 16, 2007.  DOHA issued a Notice of Hearing on\nDecember 18, 2007, and I convened the hearing as scheduled on January 10, 2008.\nMarch 13, 2008\n\n2\nThe Government offered Exhibits (Ex.) 1 through 8, which were received without\nobjection. Applicant testified and submitted Exhibits A through F.  Exhibit A received an\nobjection, and I upheld the objection because the exhibit documents were the SOR and\nother documents already in the file.  DOHA received the transcript of the hearing (Tr.)\non January 22, 2008.  I granted Applicant\u2019s request to keep the record open until\nJanuary 25, 2008, to submit additional matters.  On January 25, 2008, he submitted\nExhibits G to O, without objection. The record closed on January 25, 2008. Based upon\na review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility for access to\nclassified information is granted.\nFindings of Fact\nIn his Answer to the SOR, dated June 25, 2007, Applicant denied the factual\nallegations in \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.c, 1.d., 1.f., and 1.g. of the SOR, with explanations. He admitted\nthe factual allegations in \u00b6\u00b6 1.i. of the SOR. He neither admitted nor denied the\nallegations contained in \u00b6\u00b6 1.b., 1.e., 1.h., 1.j., and 1.k. of the SOR.  He also provided\nadditional information to support his request for eligibility for a security clearance. \nApplicant is 43 years old, divorced with custody of his nine-year-old daughter,\nand works for a defense contractor.  He was divorced in 1999 after his daughter was\nborn.  His wife did not want to continue with the marriage or take care of the child.  A\nproperty settlement divided the property and debts between Applicant and his former\nwife.  His former wife was responsible for the automobile debt because she took the\nautomobile.  They were equally responsible for any debts incurred during the marriage,\nand separately responsible for debts they individually incurred after the marriage.\nApplicant\u2019s former wife was ordered to have reasonable visitation and to pay Applicant\n$300 monthly for child support.  Applicant has not received this money.  Applicant also\nis a military veteran, serving from 1986 until 2001. (Tr. 37, 38, 55, 107, 110; Exhibit 1)\nApplicant\u2019s credit reports show several unpaid judgments and delinquent debts.\nFrom 2005 onward, Applicant exerted efforts with increasing intensity, reflected in the\nvolume of the copies of his letters and emails to creditors, to resolve his delinquent\ndebts.  Some debts he repaid or settled before the SOR issuance date.  The current\nstatus of each of the delinquent debts listed in Paragraph 1 of the SOR is as follows\n(Exhibits C, N, O):\nDEBT ALLEGATION\nCURRENT STATUS/EVIDENCE\n1.a. \nDepartment \nstore \ncredit \ncard,\n$2,172, denied\nUnpaid.  Confirmed was wife\u2019s account.\nLetter from company, statement from\nsecurity officer who heard company tell\nApplicant account belonged to his former\nwife. Not on current credit report. (Tr. 61-\n66, 110; Exhibits 2, 3, 5-8, B, H, G. N)\n\n3\n1.b. Seven medical accounts, neither\nadmitted nor denied, $1,763.\nApplicant paid $825.21 on these debts\nover the past two years.  He paid $275\nfor three months on these debts. He paid\nthe co-pay at time of service, and his\ninsurance was to pay any balances\naccording to the contract.  The hospital is\nresearching their bills to determine exact\namount owed. (Tr. 66-71, 101, 103, 110;\nExhibits 2, 3, 5-8, C, G, I, N)\n1.c. Bank credit card debt, $2,198.\nDenies\nApplicant settled this debt for $1,232 in\nJanuary 2007.  It was a judgment and\nwhen seeking a mortgage loan for his\ncurrent house, the bank told him he\nneeded to pay judgments. (Tr. 74-84,\n112; Exhibits 2-8, Exhibits C, G, N, O,\nAnswer)\n1.d. Debt collector, $605, denies\nAccount cancelled by latest collection\nagency. (Tr. 85-87, 113; Exhibits 2-8, C,\nG, N, O)\n1.e. Collection agency for $588, neither\nadmits nor denies\nUnpaid because Applicant does not have\nany information on the debt and denies\nhe owes it.  He wrote several letters\nattempting to confirm this debt.  It is from\nan electric power company debt from\n2001 when he lived in another state.  He\nhas not gotten a response, but would pay\nit if it is confirmed as a legitimate debt of\nhis. (Tr. 87,113; Exhibits 2-8, C, G, J N,\nO)\n1.f. Collection agency for retailer, $4,884,\ndenies\nApplicant does not have an account with\nthe retailer, and the company told\nApplicant over the phone he does not\nowe any money.  This statement was\nwitnessed by a security officer at his work\nlocation.  Applicant wrote several letters\nover the past year attempting to resolve\nthis account.  Applicant does not owe this\ndebt. (Tr. 89, 113; Exhibits 2-8, C, G, K,\nN, O).\n\n4\n1.g. Catalog company collection, $835,\ndenies, unpaid\nApplicant does not have any account with\nthis company.  Company closed in 2002.\nJanuary 2008 letter from receiver states\naccount permanently closed.  Applicant\ndoes not owe this debt. (Tr. 91, 119, 120;\nExhibits 2-8, C, G, K, N, O)\n1.h. Cell telephone company debt, $217\nand $378, neither admits nor denies. \nApplicant paid $231 to one collection\nagency on September 28, 2007.  Another\nagency claims it owns the account.\nApplicant told it he paid the other creditor\nand for them both to work it out between\nthemselves. $378 is unpaid because no\ncreditor has information on the account,\naccording to Applicant, and without proof\nof the debt, he will not pay it. (Tr. 92-94,\n121; Exhibits 2-8, C, G, M, N, O)\n1.i. Sanitation company debt, $91, admits\nPaid debt on October 2, 2007. (Tr. 95,\n122; Exhibits 2-8, C, G, N, O, Answer)\n1.j. Telephone or cable company, $181,\ndenies knowledge of this debt\nPaid on September 27, 2007.  (Tr. 95,\n122; Exhibits 2-8, C, G, N, O, Answer)\n1.k. Telephone bill for $67, denies\nknowledge of this debt\nPaid on September 27, 2007. Creditor did\nnot \ncash \ncheck, \nApplicant \nstopped\npayment on check. (Tr. 95, 96, 104, 105,\n122; Exhibits 2-8, C, G, N, O, Answer)\nApplicant contacted a credit counseling agency.  He paid $400 for their services,\nattempting to resolve his debts through disputes or payment.  He received only three\ncredit reports from them, and he was not satisfied with their service.  Applicant paid\n$6,188 on his debts, including the $4,000 on the car loan judgment debt. (Tr. 101, 126;\nExhibits C, G)\nApplicant completed his SCA on October 24, 2005.  In response to Question 37\n(any judgments in the past seven years which remain unpaid), Applicant answered,\n\u201cno.\u201d   Unbeknownst to Applicant, he had a judgment against him in his former state of\nresidence, owed to a bank for $9,813 as the balance on a car loan.  He never received\nnotice of the lawsuit. This car loan pertained to the auto his former wife took when they\ndivorced.  She allowed the car to be repossessed, and never told Applicant about it.\nApplicant was able to settle it for $4,000 on January 25, 2007.  \nIn answer to SCA Question 38 (any debts in the past seven years more than 180\ndays delinquent), Applicant answered, \u201cno.\u201d  Applicant\u2019s credit reports showed the debts\nlisted in SOR Paragraph 1. Applicant answered the two questions based on the\ninformation he had at the time.  He did not think at that time he had any debts older than\n\n5\n180 days.  Applicant repeatedly stated he wanted proof that any debts were legitimately\nhis before he undertook to pay them.   Based on that belief, he answered these two\nSCA questions truthfully.  He did not intend to mislead or falsify his answers. (Tr. 47-50,\n128-130, 136-138, 154, 155, 170; Exhibits 2-8, C, G, N, O, Answer)\nApplicant submitted 19 character statements from the people for whom he works\nat his job location.  Applicant works in information technology.  His character statements\nwere written by general officers, field and company grade officers, civilians, and staff\nprofessionals.  All statements show the writers trust Applicant, and praise his personal\nand professional conduct on the job. (Exhibit E)  \nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, the administrative judge applies the guidelines in\nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s\nover-arching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision.\nAccording to AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of\nvariables known as the \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider\nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and\nunfavorable, in making a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\n\n6\ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of\nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \nAnalysis\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set\nout in AG & 18:      \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to\nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended\nis at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under\nAG & 19(a), an Ainability or unwillingness to satisfy debts@ is potentially disqualifying.\nSimilarly under AG & 19(c), Aa history of not meeting financial obligations@ may raise\nsecurity concerns. Applicant accumulated delinquent debt and was unable to pay these\nobligations. The evidence is sufficient to raise these potentially disqualifying conditions,\nrequiring a closer examination.\nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security\nconcerns arising from financial difficulties. Under AG \u00b6 20(a), the disqualifying condition\nmay be mitigated where Athe behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or\noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt\non the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.@ Applicant=s\ndelinquent debts occurred after his divorce.  He moved in 2001 from his former state of\nresidence to his present location.  He knew nothing about the judgments against him\nwhich were filed in his former state.  These debts occurred some years ago, with no\nevidence of recent debt except for his mortgage loan.  I find the behavior occurred\nunder unusual circumstances (his divorce, subsequent move, former wife\u2019s\nirresponsibility) that it is unlikely to recur, and it does not raise concerns about his\ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment. The evidence raises this\npotentially mitigating condition. \n\n7\nEvidence that Athe person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem\nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control@\nis potentially mitigating under AG & 20(c). Similarly, AG & 20(d) applies where the\nevidence shows Athe individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or\notherwise resolve debts.@ Applicant received counseling, though he was not satisfied\nwith the results.  He took it upon himself to write many letters from 2006 onward and\nsend emails to all the collection agencies, businesses, and other creditors he could\nlocate.  He testified he researched them on the internet, and made many telephone\ncalls attempting to resolve the debts.  The volume of correspondence and emails he\nintroduced into the record show his persistence and diligence in obtaining information\nattempting to pay his debts.  He paid six of the eleven listed delinquent debts, and spent\n$6,188 to do so.   He resolved the balance of the delinquent debts by obtaining letters\nor emails from the creditors that he was not liable, or a witness statement regarding two\ndebts when he knew he could not get a statement from the creditor. He is financially\nsound and prepared for future contingencies. I conclude these potentially mitigating\nconditions apply.\nGuideline E, Personal Conduct\nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Personal Conduct is set forth in\n\u00b615, and states as follows:\n\u201cConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or\nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions\nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect\nclassified information.  Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful\nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other\nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process.\u201d\nThe guideline states several Disqualifying Conditions that could raise security\nconcerns.  Under \u00b616(a), \u201cinvolving deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of\nrelevant facts from any personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or\nsimilar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, or\ndetermine trustworthiness, and \u00b616(b), \u201cdeliberately providing false or misleading\ninformation concerning relevant facts to an employer, investigator, security official, or\nother official government representative,\u201d apply if Applicant deliberately falsified his\nanswers to Questions 37 and 38.  However, after hearing Applicant\u2019s explanation, and\nexamining his exhibits, I conclude that he did not deliberately falsify his answers.  He\nsincerely believed that he had no debts more than 180 days delinquent, he knew of no\ndebts specifically proven to be his responsibility which were delinquent, and did not\nknow about the judgments against him in his former state of residence when he\ncompleted the SCA.  Applicant is persuasive and credible in his explanation.  The\nefforts Applicant took since 2006 to obtain information on these delinquent debts are so\ncomprehensive, persistent, and zealous, that only some one who truly did not know\nabout them would have gone to that extent to discover the information, and then\ndocument it in such detail and volume.\n\n8\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness\nof the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include\nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which participation\nis voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent\nbehavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure,\ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d\nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security\nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration\nof the guidelines and the whole person concept.       \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. While some debts remain unpaid,\nthey are insufficient to raise security concerns.  Some of these debts were clearly not\nApplicant\u2019s debts.  There are no recent debts which are delinquent, showing he is\nmanaging his money prudently.  The divorce gave rise to these debts, and Applicant is\ntrying to pay them.  There is no potential for pressure or coercion based on the extent of\nApplicant\u2019s efforts shown by his extensive documentation chronicling his persistent\nefforts to resolve his debts, and his demonstrated sincerity in trying to resolve these\ndebts.  His explanations and demeanor at the hearing show it is not likely that he will\nincur such debts in the future.  \nI also considered and gave substantial weight to Applicant\u2019s character\nreferences, and the fact that he has custody of his daughter after his wife did not want\nto be a mother and a wife.  His dedication to the care of his daughter demonstrates his\nheightened sense of responsibility, in addition to his zeal in resolving his debts.\nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts as to\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I\nconclude Applicant mitigated the security concerns arising from his financial\nconsiderations and personal conduct security concerns, and I conclude them for him.   I\nalso conclude the \u201cwhole person\u201d concept for Applicant.\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 1.a. to 1.k:\nFor Applicant\n\n9\nParagraph 2, Guideline E:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 2.a. and 2.b:\nFor Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is\nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is granted.\n                                              \n_________________\nPHILIP S. HOWE\nAdministrative Judge\n",

The action\nwas taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within\nIndustry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6,\nDefense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as\namended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the\nPresident on December 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for\nSORs issued after September 1, 2006. \nApplicant answered the SOR on October 25, 2007, and requested an\nadministrative determination. On March 12, 2008, the government prepared a File of\nRelevant Materials (FORM). It was sent to Applicant on March 17, 2008, and received\nMay 9, 2009. Applicant was instructed to file any objections or supply any additional\ninformation within 30 days of her receipt of the FORM.  She elected not to do so, and\nAugust 11, 2008\n\nSee F.R.C.P. Rule 16(a)(3)(A).\n1\nShe was discharged after becoming pregnant with her oldest child.\n2\n2\nthe case was assigned to me on July 7, 2008. Based upon a review of the FORM,\naccess to classified information is denied.\nEvidentiary and Procedural Rulings\n1. The government moved to amend the SOR by adding allegations under\nGuideline E that Applicant falsified a 2004 security clearance application by failing to list\na number of charges and a subsequent conviction related to a fraudulent check cashing\nscheme and a conviction for driving with a revoked license. The motion was filed five\nmonths after the SOR\u2019s issuance and four months after Applicant\u2019s Answer. Unlike the\nFederal Rules of Civil Procedure,  DoDD 5220.6 does not mandate time limits for\n1\namending SORs because the preservation of national security transcends technical\ncourt procedure. However, the government still needs to establish good cause for\namending the SOR (Additional Procedural Guidance Enclosure 3.1.17). Here, the\ngovernment has already included the criminal involvement, which Applicant allegedly\nomitted from her security clearance application, under Guideline J, criminal conduct\nBecause the nature of the alleged criminal conduct is essentially credibility-related, I can\nconsider any additional credibility evidence regardless of whether it is alleged in the\nSOR. (ISCR Case No. 98-0582 at 9 (App. Bd. Nov. 12, 1999)). I conclude the\ngovernment does not have good cause to amend the SOR. The motion is denied.\n2. SOR subparagraphs 2.a through 2.f allege delinquent financial debts owed to\nunidentified creditors. Applicant denied them. SOR subparagraph 3.a alleges, among\nother things, that Applicant failed to include these unidentified delinquent debts on her\nsecurity clearance application. Although SOR drafting is not held to the strict standards\nof criminal indictments, they must, at a minimum, be drafted with enough specificity to\nenable applicants to prepare responses. These subparagraphs fail to meet this\nminimum threshold, therefore, I resolve them in Applicant\u2019s favor, and will not address\nthem further. \nFindings of Fact\nApplicant is a 30-year-old single woman with three pre-teen children. She served\nin the U.S. Army from 1997 through her honorable discharge in 1999.  For the past\n2\nthree years, she has been working for a contractor, assisting families of deceased\nservice members (Answer).\nIn 1997, Applicant opened a federal credit union account. In 2000, she presented\nthree paychecks for the credit union to cash, collectively totaling $3,328, that were\n\nThe maker is the person or entity who signs or is identified in the check as the person undertaking to pay it\n3\n(U.C.C. \u00a7 3-103(a)(7)).\nThe drawee bank is the bank from which the check is drawn (U.C.C. \u00a73-103(a)(4)).\n4\nThis is the same apartment complex where the treasurer of the non-profit organization, whose checkbook\n5\nwas stolen and used by Applicant to forge checks, worked as a property manager.\n3\npayable to her and endorsed by her (Item 8 at 4-5). The maker of the checks was a\ncompany where Applicant purportedly worked.3\nThe credit union cashed the checks and posted the money to Applicant\u2019s\naccount. Over the next three days, Applicant had money wired to her from her credit\nunion account three times to locations in three different states (Item 7 at pages 4-6).\nWhen the credit union presented the checks to the bank of Applicant\u2019s alleged employer\n(the drawee bank)  for reimbursement, it was informed that the account had been\n4\nclosed. \nThe drawee bank then contacted its corporate security office, who then located\nthe company where Applicant allegedly worked, and began interviewing members of the\ncompany (Item 7 at 5). The investigation revealed that the company was a small, non-\nprofit volunteer organization that employed no paid employees (Item 8 at 6). It\nmaintained a checking account for operating expenses, which it had closed shortly after\nthe checks were stolen from the treasurer\u2019s car during a break-in. As part of the\ninvestigation, the authorities showed the treasurer Applicant\u2019s signature on the back of\nthe checks. The treasurer then identified Applicant as a past tenant of an apartment\nlocated in a complex that the treasurer managed, and stated that Applicant vacated the\napartment without paying a $2,000 rent debt (Id.). \nWhile the investigation was pending, Applicant attempted to cash three more\nchecks, totaling $6,000, through her credit union (Item 8 at 5). By then, the credit union\nwas aware of Applicant\u2019s fraudulent scheme, and contacted the Federal Bureau of\nInvestigation (FBI). \nIn February 2004, Applicant was indicted for bank fraud, a felony. She pleaded\nguilty to the lesser offenses of larceny within a special maritime jurisdiction, and\nreceiving stolen property within a special maritime jurisdiction (Item 7 at 2). The court,\non November 10, 2004, sentenced her to two years probation, and ordered her to pay\nrestitution (Item 8 at 3). By November 16, 2006, Applicant had paid the restitution (Id.).\nApplicant owes 19 creditors approximately $35,000 in delinquent debt. The debts\ninclude utilities (SOR subparagraphs 2.h, 2.i, 2.l through 2.o, and 2.r), credit accounts\nowed to banks and department stores (SOR subparagraphs 2.g, 2.j, 2.t,), medical bills\n(SOR subparagraphs 2.g and 2.j), two automobile delinquencies (SOR subparagraphs\n2.u, and 2.w), an account owed to an apartment complex (SOR subparagraph 2.x) , and\n5\n\nSOR subparagraph 2.s is a duplicate of subparagraph 2.g, and SOR subparagraph 2.z is a duplicate of 2.v.\n6\n4\nseveral miscellaneous delinquencies (2.g, 2.k, 2.v, 2.y, 2.aa, and 2.bb). Two of the\ndebts listed in the SOR, subparagraphs 2.s and 2.z, are duplicates of other SOR debts.6\nApplicant admitted SOR subparagraphs 2.h through 2.j, 2.r, and 2.t, and denied\nthe remainder. She asserts that she has either been satisfying them through payment\nplans, or is currently negotiating payment plans. She provided no documentary\nevidence supporting these assertions.\nAs for the denials, Applicant wrote the creditors listed in SOR subparagraphs 2.k\nthrough 2.m, and 2.o, either officially disputing them, or requesting further information.\nShe provided no evidence of any efforts to contact the creditors of the other denials.\nNone of the disputed delinquencies were substantiated with documentation.\nApplicant answered \u201cNo\u201d to Section 38 of a Questionnaire for National Security\nPositions (QNSP), executed on April 4, 2004, which required her to disclose whether\nshe had been more than 180 days delinquent on any debt within seven years of the\nQNSP\u2019s completion. SOR subparagraphs 2(l), 2(x), and 2(aa), either were not 180 days\ndelinquent or had not been reported as delinquent when Applicant completed the QNSP\n(See Item 15 at 6-7). The remainder were more than 180 days delinquent when she\ncompleted the QNSP. Applicant asserts that the omissions were unintentional. She also\ndid not disclose her 2004 bank fraud indictment and subsequent conviction for\nembezzlement theft on the QNSP.\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a\nscrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The\nAdministrative Judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person,\npast and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\n\n5\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nAnalysis\nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct\nUnder this guideline, \u201ccriminal activity creates doubt about a person\u2019s judgment,\nreliability, and trustworthiness\u201d (AG \u00b6 30). Also, \u201cby its very nature, it calls into question\na person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules and regulations\u201d (Id.). Here,\nApplicant organized a fraudulent scheme that enabled her to swindle more than $3,000\nfrom a federal credit union by presenting invalid checks to be cashed. She did not stop\nthis activity until the credit union detected the fraud, and refused to cash more invalid\nchecks. AG \u00b631(a), \u201ca single serious crime . . ., \u201c applies. \nI have considered the mitigating conditions and conclude none apply. Applicant\ncommitted a crime of deception, that on its face, is indicative of a lack of honesty. It was\ncompounded by her failure to disclose it on her security clearance application. She was\nconvicted less than five years ago. In her Answer, she alluded to pressures in her life\nthat led her to commit the crime, but did not elaborate. Although she paid restitution, it\nhas less probative value because it was court-ordered. Her employment at the same job\nfor three years demonstrates stability, but absent any evidence of her job performance,\nhas limited probative value. Applicant has not mitigated the criminal conduct security\nconcern.\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nUnder this guideline, \u201cfailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts,\nand meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about\nan individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information\u201d (AG\n\u00b6 18). Moreover, \u201can individual who is financially overextended is at risk of having to\nengage in illegal acts to generate funds\u201d (Id.). Here, Applicant\u2019s extensive financial\nproblems trigger the application of AG & 19(a), \u201can inability or unwillingness to satisfy\ndebts,@ and AG & 19(c), Aa history of not meeting financial obligations.\u201d\nI have considered the mitigating conditions and conclude none apply. Her\ncontention that the acknowledged delinquencies were being satisfied through current or\nimminent payment plans was not supported by documentary evidence. Similarly, she\nprovided no documentary evidence to establish a reasonable basis for the\ndelinquencies she denied. She has not mitigated the financial considerations security\nconcern.\n\n6\nGuideline E, Personal Conduct\nUnder this guideline, \u201cconduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor,\ndishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions\nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified\ninformation\u201d (AG \u00b6 15). Here, Applicant\u2019s omission of financial delinquencies from her\nsecurity clearance application raises the issue of whether AG \u00b6 16(a), \u201cdeliberate\nomission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from any personnel security\nquestionnaire, personal history statement, or similar form used to conduct\ninvestigations, determine employment qualifications, award benefits or status,\ndetermine security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary\nresponsibilities,\u201d applies. In light of the significant pattern of deception Applicant\ndemonstrated by executing the fraudulent check cashing scheme, I conclude her\nomission from her security clearance application was intentional. AG \u00b6 16(a) applies\nwithout mitigation. Applicant has not mitigated the personal conduct security concern.\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an\napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security\nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration\nof the guidelines and the whole person concept. \nApplicant engaged in illegal acts to generate funds. As the record indicates, she\nwas financially overextended at the time. Because she is still financially overextended,\nthe possibility that she may engage in similar future conduct remains unacceptably high.\nEvaluating this case using the whole person factors, I conclude that it is not clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to grant Applicant access to classified information.\nClearance is denied.\n\n7\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline J:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.b:\nAgainst Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline F:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 2.a - 2f:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraphs 2.g-2.r:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.s:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraphs 2.t-2.y:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.z:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraphs 2.aa-2.bb:\nAgainst Applicant\nParagraph 3, Guideline E:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 3.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.\n                                             \n_________________\nMARC E. CURRY\nAdministrative Judge\n",

On November 21, 2007, DOHA issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant\nof the basis for that decision\u2014security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations)\nof Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive).  Applicant\nrequested a hearing.  On March 12, 2008, after the hearing, Administrative Judge Edward W.\nLoughran denied Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.  Applicant timely appealed pursuant\nto the Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nApplicant raised the following issue on appeal: whether the Judge\u2019s failure to mitigate the\nGuideline F security concerns is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  Finding no error, we\naffirm.\nApplicant argues that the Judge\u2019s adverse decision should be reversed because the Judge did\nnot give sufficient weight to Applicant\u2019s mitigating evidence which he contends showed that the\noutstanding debts were old, that he had taken reasonable steps to resolve his financial problems, and\nthat he has outstanding character references.  Applicant\u2019s arguments do not demonstrate that the\nJudge erred. \nOnce the government presents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the\napplicant to establish mitigation.  The presence of some mitigating evidence does not alone compel\nthe Judge to make a favorable security clearance decision.  As the trier of fact, the Judge has to\nweigh the evidence as a whole and decide whether the favorable evidence outweighs the unfavorable\nevidence, or vice versa.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 06-10320 at 2 (App. Bd. Nov. 7, 2007).  An\napplicant\u2019s disagreement with the Judge\u2019s weighing of the evidence, or an ability to argue for a\ndifferent interpretation of the evidence, is not sufficient to demonstrate the Judge weighed the\nevidence or reached conclusions in a manner that is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  See,\ne.g., ISCR Case No. 06-17409 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct. 12, 2007).\nIn this case, the Judge found that Applicant had 18 delinquent debts totaling approximately\n$33,509, none of which had been paid.  He had completed mandatory credit counseling in November\n2007, in anticipation of a bankruptcy, and had filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy later that same month.\nApplicant\u2019s bankruptcy petition reflected three repossessed cars, although Applicant testified that\nhe believed there had actually been four voluntarily repossessed cars.  At the time of the hearing,\nApplicant\u2019s debts had not yet been discharged.  Decision at 3.  In  light of the foregoing, the Judge\ncould reasonably conclude that Applicant\u2019s financial problems were still ongoing.   See, e.g., ISCR\nCase No. 06-23894 at 2 (App. Bd. Mar. 6, 2008).  \nThe Judge weighed the mitigating evidence offered by Applicant against the length and\nseriousness of the disqualifying conduct and considered the possible application of relevant\nmitigating conditions.  He gave Applicant partial credit under the relevant mitigating conditions.\nHowever, he reasonably explained why the evidence which Applicant had presented in mitigation\nwas insufficient to overcome the government\u2019s security concerns.  The Board does not review a case\nde novo.  The favorable record evidence cited by Applicant is not sufficient to demonstrate the\nJudge\u2019s decision is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 06-11172 at\n\n3\n2 (App. Bd. Sep. 4, 2007).  Given the record that was before him, the Judge\u2019s ultimate unfavorable\nsecurity clearance decision under Guideline F is sustainable.\nOrder\nThe decision of the Judge denying Applicant a security clearance is AFFIRMED.\nSigned: Jean E.

Michael Lyles, Esq., Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro Se \n \n \n \n______________ \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \n \nLOUGHRAN, Edward W., Administrative Judge: \n \nApplicant failed to mitigate the security concerns raised by his financial history. \nEligibility for access to classified information is denied.  \n \nOn November 21, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) \nissued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns under Guideline \nF, Financial Considerations. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; \nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security \nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised \nadjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and \neffective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006.  \n  \n \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on December 18, 2007, and requested a \nhearing before an Administrative Judge. The case was assigned to another \nAdministrative Judge on January 17, 2008, and reassigned to me on February 4, 2008. \nDOHA issued a notice of hearing on January 28, 2008. I convened the hearing as \nMarch 12, 2008\n\n \n2 \n \n \nscheduled on February 21, 2008. The government offered Exhibits (GE) 1 through 3, \nwhich were received without objection. Applicant testified on his own behalf and \nsubmitted Exhibits (AE) A through I, without objection. DOHA received the transcript of \nthe hearing (Tr.) on March 7, 2008.   \n \nProcedural and Evidentiary Rulings \n \nI advised Applicant of his right under \u00b6 E3.1.8 of the Directive to 15 days notice \nbefore the hearing. Applicant affirmatively waived his right to 15 days notice.   \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn his Answer to the SOR, dated December 18, 2007, Applicant admitted all the \nfactual allegations in the SOR, with explanations. He also provided additional \ninformation to support his request for eligibility for a security clearance.   \n \n \nApplicant is a 30-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He is a high school \ngraduate and is attending classes toward an associate degree. He served in the U.S. \nmilitary from 1997 to 2001, and was honorably discharged. He is married and has two \nstepchildren, ages 12 and 13.1  \n \n \nApplicant joined the military when he was 19 years old. He was unsophisticated \nabout finances and the ways of the world. He met his future wife who was also in the \nmilitary. She had two children, and as he stated, \u201cshe was 23 and from the City.\u201d They \nmoved in together by the end of 1997. Applicant started accepting credit offers and \nbecame overextended. His future wife left the military in 1998 and did not work. She \nwent to school and some bills went unpaid. She handled the finances and told him, \u201cit\u2019s \nokay to miss a couple of payments until she got a job.\u201d They married in 1999. She \nfinished her education, but her employment was sporadic. Applicant was discharged \nfrom the military in 2001. He did not seek reenlistment because he felt he could earn \nmore in the civilian world. He could not. They moved a number of times over the next \nseveral years. They lived with her mother, and then with his parents, but they both \ncontinued to have employment problems. She went for lengthy periods between jobs. \nShe went back into the military in about 2002, but only stayed on active duty for about \nsix to eight months. They separated and reconciled a few times.2   \n \n \nApplicant realized his marriage was not working out and separated from his wife \nin 2006. He moved home to live with his parents. He obtained his job with his current \nemployer in November 2006. Applicant filed for divorce. He testified it should be final \nwithin about two weeks of the hearing date.3 \n                                                          \n1 Tr. at 29, 30; GE 1; AE A, D, I. \n \n2 Tr. at 16-17; Applicant\u2019s Answer to SOR; GE 1. \n \n3 Tr. at 17; Applicant\u2019s Answer to SOR; AE F. \n \n\n \n3 \n \n \n \nThe SOR alleges 18 delinquent debts totaling approximately $33,509. Applicant \nadmitted owing all the listed debts, and none of the 18 debts have been paid. He \ncompleted mandatory credit counseling on November 6, 2007, in anticipation of a \nbankruptcy. He filed Chapter 7 bankruptcy on November 30, 2007. His bankruptcy \npetition reflects three repossessed cars. Applicant testified that he believed there were \nfour voluntarily repossessed cars. His debts have not yet been discharged.4 \n \n \nApplicant submitted letters from two supervisors. He is described as an \nexemplary employee who has always received good evaluations. They state he is \nethical, a team player with a great attitude, and an asset to their organization. He has \nworked many hours of overtime without complaint.5 \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, Administrative Judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative \nJudge\u2019s over-arching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. \nAccording to AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of \nvariables known as the \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must \nconsider all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable \nand unfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n                                                          \n4 Tr. at 17-18, 31-32; Applicant\u2019s Answer to SOR; AE B, E. \n \n5 AE C, G, H. \n \n\n \n4 \n \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG \u00b6 18:       \n \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds.  \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. Two are potentially applicable in this case:   \n \n \n(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts; and \n \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \n \n \nApplicant accumulated a number of delinquent debts and was unable to pay his \nobligations for a period of time. The evidence is sufficient to raise the above potentially \ndisqualifying conditions.  \n \n  \nFive Financial Considerations Mitigating Conditions under AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a)-(e) are \npotentially applicable:  \n \n \n \n\n \n5 \n \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or \nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem \nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is \nunder control; \n \n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \notherwise resolve debts; and \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \n \n \nApplicant has 18 delinquent debts totaling more than $33,000. While a young \nand impressionable member of the military, he met and eventually married another \nservice member with two children. She is older than Applicant, but far from mature. \nThey both left the military and went through a number of years of sporadic employment. \nTheir employment issues are conditions that were largely beyond his control. However, \nhe permitted at least three cars to be repossessed, and there is no evidence that he \nmade an effort to pay any of his debts, even the small debts, since he started working \nfor his current employer in November 2006. I am unable to make a finding that Applicant \nacted responsibly under the circumstances. FC MC 20(b) is partially applicable.  \n \nApplicant will soon be divorced from his wife and his debts will be discharged in \nbankruptcy. He appears to be on the right track. He is living with his parents and is \nworking overtime for a company that values his work. He received mandatory financial \ncounseling as part of his bankruptcy and there are indications that the problem is being \nresolved and is under control. However, it is too soon for a determination that the \nproblems are unlikely to recur and do not cast doubt on his current reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment. Applicant satisfied the first prong of FC MC 20(c). \nThe second prong is partially applicable. No other mitigating condition is completely \napplicable. \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \n\n \n6 \n \n \nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant was young and \nunsophisticated when he became involved with another service member with two \nchildren. They lived together and then married. He left the military with an Honorable \nDischarge to seek a more lucrative job, but he failed to find one. She did not work for \nextended periods and debts became delinquent. He is attempting to resolve all his \nissues. His divorce is imminent, and barring something unforeseen, his debts should be \ndischarged in bankruptcy. He now has a good job where he is highly regarded. He lives \nat home, attends college, and works overtime. Applicant is still too early in the process \nfor a determination that his finances are in order. One year from now, his financial \nproblems may be a thing of the past. At this instant they remain a concern.  \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant has not mitigated the security concerns arising from his financial \nissues.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1r: \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n7 \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n_____________________ \nEdward W.

On October 10, 2007, DOHA issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant\nof the basis for that decision\u2014security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations)\nof Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive).  Applicant\nrequested a hearing.  On April 2, 2008, after the hearing, Administrative Judge Matthew E. Malone\ndenied Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.  Applicant timely appealed pursuant to the\nDirective \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nApplicant raised the following issue on appeal: whether the Judge\u2019s adverse clearance\ndecision is arbitrary, capricious or contrary to law.\n \nApplicant asks that the Judge\u2019s adverse decision be reversed, based on a general assertion\nthat it is \u201cunfair.\u201d  Applicant has not demonstrated that the Judge erred. \nThe presence of some mitigating evidence does not alone compel the Judge to make a\nfavorable security clearance decision.  As the trier of fact, the Judge has to weigh the evidence as a\nwhole and decide whether the favorable evidence outweighs the unfavorable evidence, or vice versa.\nSee, e.g., ISCR Case No. 06-10320 at 2 (App. Bd. Nov. 7, 2007).  An applicant\u2019s disagreement with\nthe Judge\u2019s weighing of the evidence, or an ability to argue for a different interpretation of the\nevidence, is not sufficient to demonstrate the Judge weighed the evidence or reached conclusions in\na manner that is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 06-17409 at 3\n(App. Bd. Oct. 12, 2007).\nIn this case, the Judge found that Applicant had a lengthy and serious history of not meeting\nfinancial obligations.  At the time of the hearing, Applicant still had a significant number of\ndelinquent debts.  In light of the foregoing, the Judge could reasonably conclude that Applicant\u2019s\nfinancial problems were still ongoing.   See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 05-07747 at 2 (App. Bd. Jul. 3,\n2007).  The Judge weighed the mitigating evidence offered by Applicant against the length and\nseriousness of the disqualifying conduct and considered the possible application of relevant\nconditions and factors.  He found in favor of Applicant as to some of the SOR allegations.1\nHowever, he reasonably explained why the evidence which the Applicant had presented in mitigation\nwas insufficient to overcome the government\u2019s security concerns.  The Board does not review a case\nde novo.  After reviewing the record, the Board concludes that the Judge examined the relevant data\nand articulated a satisfactory explanation for his decision, \u201cincluding a \u2018rational connection between\nthe facts found and the choice made.\u2019\u201d Motor Vehicle Mfrs.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Under Guideline F, the government alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a - 1.q that Applicant was delinquent on 17 debts totaling $11,234. Eight of the debts (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a - 1.d, 1.i, 1.j, 1.m, 1.n) had been referred to collection agencies, four had been enforced through judgments against Applicant (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.e - 1.h), and the remaining five had been charged off as business losses (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.k, 1.l, 1.o - 1.q). Applicant responded to the SOR on November 8, 2007, and admitted all of the SOR allegations, but did not say if she wanted a hearing or not. On December 7, 2007, apparently in response to DOHA\u2019s request she specify her intentions, she submitted a revised answer whereby she admitted owing a total of $3,691 for the debts listed in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a - 1.c, 1.e, 1.f, and 1.k - 1.p (the total for these debts as alleged in the SOR was $3,114). She denied owing $7,543 for the debts listed in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.g - 1.j, and 1.q (the total for these debts as alleged in the SOR was $6,447).

Blank, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro Se\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nMALONE, Matthew E., Administrative Judge:\nBased upon a review of the pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, Applicant\u2019s\nrequest for a security clearance is denied.\nOn October 16, 2006, Applicant submitted an Questionnaire for Sensitive\nPositions (SF 86) to request a security clearance for her employment with a defense\ncontractor. After reviewing the results of the ensuing background investigation,\nadjudicators for the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) were unable to\nmake a preliminary affirmative finding  that it is clearly consistent with the national\n1\ninterest to grant Applicant\u2019s request. On October 10, 2007, DOHA issued to Applicant a\nStatement of Reasons (SOR) alleging facts which raise security concerns addressed in\nthe Revised Adjudicative Guidelines (AG)  under Guideline F (financial considerations).\n2\nApril 2, 2008\n\nEnclosure 2 to the Directive, and they apply to all adjudications or trustworthiness determinations in which an\nSOR was issued on or after September 1, 2006.\n Tr. 71 - 72, 75 - 77, 109 - 110.\n3\n See, Section E3.1.17 of the Directive\u2019s Enclosure 3.\n4\n2\nApplicant timely responded to the SOR and requested a hearing. The case was\nassigned to an administrative judge on December 27, 2007. On January 4, 2008, the\ncase was re-assigned to me, and I scheduled a hearing to be held on January 23, 2008.\nThe parties appeared as scheduled. The government presented four exhibits (Gx. 1 - 4).\nApplicant testified in her own behalf. DOHA received the transcript (Tr.) on January 31,\n2008. Additionally, I left the record open to allow Applicant to submit additional relevant\ninformation; however, she failed to make any post-hearing submission and the record\nclosed on February 15, 2008.3\nProcedural Issues\n1. Applicant did not receive DOHA\u2019s Notice of Hearing, which is dated January 7,\n2008, until January 15, 2008, less than 15 days before the hearing date. At the hearing,\nshe waived her right to 15 days of advance notice as provided by Section E3.1.8 of\nEnclosure 3 to the Directive. (Tr. 17 - 19)\n2. At hearing, Department Counsel moved to amend SOR \u00b6 1.d to conform to the\nevidence of record.  Specifically, the proposed amendment substituted the words \u201cPark\n4\nDans/ Allied for MCI\u201d in place of the words \u201can unknown medical provider.\u201d The motion\nwas supported by the information in Gx. 4, page 2, and Applicant did not object to the\ngovernment\u2019s request. Accordingly, I granted the motion. (Tr. 10 - 12, 37 - 42)\nFindings of Fact\nUnder Guideline F, the government alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a - 1.q that Applicant\nwas delinquent on 17 debts totaling $11,234. Eight of the debts (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a - 1.d, 1.i,\n1.j, 1.m, 1.n) had been referred to collection agencies, four had been enforced through\njudgments against Applicant (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.e - 1.h), and the remaining five had been\ncharged off as business losses (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.k, 1.l, 1.o - 1.q).\nApplicant responded to the SOR on November 8, 2007, and admitted all of the\nSOR allegations, but did not say if she wanted a hearing or not. On December 7, 2007,\napparently in response to DOHA\u2019s request she specify her intentions, she submitted a\nrevised answer whereby she admitted owing a total of $3,691 for the debts listed in\nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a - 1.c, 1.e, 1.f, and 1.k - 1.p (the total for these debts as alleged in the SOR\nwas $3,114). She denied owing $7,543 for the debts listed in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.g - 1.j, and 1.q\n(the total for these debts as alleged in the SOR was $6,447). At hearing, she admitted\nowing the debt listed in SOR \u00b6 1.d as amended. After a thorough review of the\npleadings, transcript, and exhibits, I make the following additional findings of fact.\n\n Directive. 6.3.\n5\n3\nApplicant is 43 years old and has been employed by a defense contractor since\nOctober 2006 as an assembly operator. She previously worked as a production worker\nfor an optical cable manufacturer from October 2003 until October 2006. Prior to that,\nshe was unemployed due to a lay off from July 2002 until October 2003. (Gx. 1; Tr. 86 -\n88)\nApplicant was married from December 1986 until obtaining a divorce in January\n2002. Of the 15 years they were together, Applicant\u2019s husband abused drugs,\nparticularly crack cocaine, for at least 12 years. They have four children together, ages\n23, 20, 19, and 18, all of whom still live with Applicant. Applicant\u2019s 20-year-old son is\nmentally challenged and is still in high school, as are her two youngest children. Her ex-\nhusband provides no support, was a financial and emotional drain on the family, was\nrecently released from jail, and is out of work. (Tr. 48, 80 - 83, 102 - 103) \nDuring and after the marriage, Applicant incurred several delinquent debts. She\nhas often had to borrow from her mother to make ends meet. She estimates she has\nreceived from her mother about $15,000 over the past 13 years, and she tries to pay\nher back every month. Applicant also uses about half her tax refund each year to repay\nher mother. (Tr. 83 - 85) Applicant also liquidated her 401(k) account from her previous\nemployer in late 2007 because she was behind on her mortgage for August through\nOctober 2007. In January 2008, she finished repaying the arrearage in addition to her\nregular monthly payments. (Tr. 65 - 68) \nOf the debts listed in the SOR, Applicant has repaid the debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.g - 1.j,\nand 1.q. She also claims to have made repayment arrangements with her remaining\ncreditors, but has not provided documentation of those arrangements. \nApplicant currently makes about $14 an hour, and her take home pay each\nmonth is about $2,000. She anticipates being eligible to earn the maximum $17 hourly\nrate by June 2008. Each month, she pays $440 for her mortgage, $360 for her car loan,\nand another $500 on insurance and utilities. After food and other expenses, she has\nabout $500 remaining each month. Applicant\u2019s check for her December car payment\nbounced. (Tr. 47, 90 - 97)\nApplicant and her children still live in the house she and her husband bought in\n1995 for $46,000. She estimates it is worth about $75,000 today. She would like to use\nthe equity in her house to get money to pay her debts, but her credit rating is too low.\nPolicies\nEach security clearance decision must be a fair, impartial, and commonsense\ndetermination based on examination of all available relevant and material information,\nand consideration of the pertinent criteria and adjudication policy in the Revised\nAdjudicative Guidelines (AG).  Decisions must also reflect consideration of the factors\n5\n\n See Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518 (1988).\n6\n See Egan, 484 U.S. at 528, 531.\n7\n See Egan; Revised Adjudicative Guidelines, \u00b6 2(b).\n8\n4\nlisted in \u00b6 2(a) of the new guidelines. Commonly referred to as the \u201cwhole person\u201d\nconcept, these factor are:\n(1) The nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nThe presence or absence of a disqualifying or mitigating condition is not\ndeterminative of a conclusion for or against an applicant. However, specific applicable\nguidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against them as they\nrepresent policy guidance governing the grant or denial of access to classified\ninformation. In this case, the pleadings and the information presented by the parties\nrequire consideration of the security concerns and adjudicative factors addressed under\nGuideline F (financial considerations) at AG \u00b6 18.\nA security clearance decision is intended to resolve whether it is clearly\nconsistent with the national interest  for an applicant to either receive or continue to\n6\nhave access to classified information. The government bears the initial burden of\nproducing admissible information on which it based the preliminary decision to deny or\nrevoke a security clearance for an applicant. Additionally, the government must be able\nto prove controverted facts alleged in the SOR. If the government meets its burden, it\nthen falls to the applicant to refute, extenuate or mitigate the government\u2019s case.\nBecause no one has a \u201cright\u201d to a security clearance, an applicant bears a heavy\nburden of persuasion.  A person who has access to classified information enters into a\n7\nfiduciary relationship with the government based on trust and confidence. The\ngovernment, therefore, has a compelling interest in ensuring each applicant possesses\nthe requisite judgement, reliability and trustworthiness of one who will protect the\nnational interests as his or her own. The \u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d\nstandard compels resolution of any reasonable doubt about an applicant\u2019s suitability for\naccess in favor of the government.8\nAnalysis\nFinancial Considerations.\nThe security concern about Applicant\u2019s finances, as stated in AG \u00b6 18, is that \n\n5\n[f]ailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to\nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended\nis at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.\nThe government presented sufficient information to support the allegations in\nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a - 1.q that Applicant was responsible for seven delinquent debts totaling\n$11,234. Most of the debts reflected in the credit reports submitted by the government\nwere incurred in or before 2002. Available information about Applicant\u2019s finances\nsupports application of the disqualifying conditions listed in AG \u00b6 19(a) (inability or\nunwillingness to satisfy debts) and AG \u00b6 19(c) (a history of not meeting financial\nobligations).\nIn response to the government\u2019s information, Applicant showed she has paid the\ndebts listed in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.g - 1.j, and 1.q totaling $6,447, or more than half the total debt\nlisted in the SOR. She also established that most of her past delinquent debts were left\nover from her marriage to a drug abuser who has failed to support his family, and were\nexacerbated by a year of unemployment in 2002 and 2003. Accordingly, I have\nconsidered the mitigating conditions at AG \u00b6 20(b) (the conditions that resulted in the\nfinancial problem were largely beyond the person's control (e.g. loss of employment, a\nbusiness downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation),\nand the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances) and AG \u00b6 20(d) (the\nindividual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve\ndebts). As to her repayment efforts, it appears Applicant has been trying to repay or\notherwise resolve her debts over the years and AG \u00b620(d) applies here. As to AG \u00b6\n20(b), although Applicant is entitled to some mitigation here, the benefit is reduced by\nthe passage of more than five years since her marriage ended, and by her continued\nemployment since 2003. \nAlso to be considered here is evidence of her own poor financial management.\nDespite apparently having a significant positive cash flow each month, Applicant failed\nto pay her mortgage for several months last year, bounced a check for her car payment\nin December 2007, and still relies on help form her mother to help make ends meet.\nFurther, I have considered here claims that she has made repayment arrangements\nwith her remaining creditors. However, despite being afforded extra time after the\nhearing, she provided no supporting documentation of the agreements or of any\npayments made. On balance, I conclude Applicant has failed to mitigate the security\nconcerns about her finances.\nWhole Person Concept. \nI have evaluated the facts presented and have applied the appropriate\nadjudicative factors under Guideline F. I have also reviewed the record before me in the\ncontext of the whole person factors listed in AG \u00b6 2(a). Applicant is a mature adult who\nhas had to support her family through adverse circumstances. However, despite\nprogress made in resolving her past due debts, available information about Applicant\u2019s\n\n See footnote 5, supra.\n9\n See footnote 8, supra. \n10\n6\nfinances present an unacceptable risk to the national interest were she to be granted\naccess to classified information at this time. Without tangible signs of payment or other\nresolution of his debts, a fair and commonsense assessment  of all of the information\n9\nbearing on Applicant\u2019s finances shows there are still doubts about her ability to protect\nthe government\u2019s interests as her own. Much of the information that would support a\nconclusion that her finances are improving \u2013 future pay raises, use of tax refunds to\nrepay her debts, and the existence of settlement agreements with her remaining\ncreditors \u2013 is speculative at best. As such, doubts remain about her current finances\nand her ability to avoid such problems in the future. Because the protection of the\nnational interest is paramount in these determinations, such doubts must be resolved in\nfavor of the national interest.10\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required by section\nE3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b: \nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d: \nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e: \nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.f:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.g: \nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.h: \nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.i:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.j:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.k: \nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.l:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.m: \nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.n:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.o:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.p: \nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.q:\nFor Applicant\n\n7\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the foregoing, it is not clearly consistent with the national interest\nto grant Applicant eligibility for a security clearance.

He also entered and exited Taiwan using his Taiwanese passport\n(TR at page 29 line 25 to page 30 line 23, and at page 33 line 14 to page 34 line 1).\nThis passport does not expire until October of 2013, but he has surrendered it to his\nemployer\u2019s Facility Security Officer (AppX C).\nAt his hearing, the Applicant also indicated that he was willing to renounce his\nTaiwanese citizenship, but he has failed to do so (TR at page 26 line 11 to page 27 line\n5, at page 28 lines 1~7, and at page 27 line 6 to page 28 line 11).  Were he to do so, he\nwould be unable to handle his parents affairs when they pass away; and as their sole\nheir, he would give up any property rights he might inherit in Taiwan (TR at page 47 line\n3 to page 48 line 8).\n2.e.  The Applicant traveled to Singapore in March of 2004, using his U.S.\npassport (TR at page 34 line 24 to page 35 line 2, and at page 36 line 23 to page 38\nline 3).\nI take administrative notice of the following facts: Taiwan has an elected\ndemocratic government.  It has the 17  largest economy in the world that is a leading\nth\nproducer of high-technology goods.  It engages in industrial and economic espionage.\nProprietary information technology is high on the Taiwanese list of targeted information\nto be acquired by their agents from foreign governments and businesses.  Although the\nU.S. now recognizes Taiwan as part of China as \u201cone-China,\u201d it continues to maintain\nstrong unofficial relations with Taiwan.\nPolicies\nPositions designated as ADP I and ADP II are classified as \u201csensitive positions\u201d\n(See Regulation \u00b6\u00b6 C3.1.2.1.1.7 and C3.1.2.1.2.3.).  \u201cThe standard that must be met for\n. . . assignment to sensitive duties is that, based on all available information, the\nperson\u2019s loyalty, reliability, and trustworthiness are such that . . . assigning the person to\nsensitive duties is clearly consistent with the interests of national security\u201d (See\nRegulation \u00b6 C6.1.1.1.).  The Deputy Under Secretary of Defense (Counterintelligence\nand Security) Memorandum, dated November 19, 2004, indicates trustworthiness\nadjudications will apply to cases forwarded to DOHA by the Defense Security Service\nand Office of Personnel Management.  Department of Defense contractor personnel\nare afforded the right to the procedures contained in the Directive before any final\nunfavorable access determination may be made (See Regulation \u00b6 C8.2.1.).\nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a public trust position, the\nAdministrative Judge must consider the disqualifying and mitigating conditions in the\n\n4\nAG.  These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process.  The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision.  According to AG \u00b6\n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as\nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d  The Administrative Judge must consider all available,\nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in\nmaking a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\n[sensitive] information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d  In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based\non the evidence contained in the record.  Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d  The\nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable\ntrustworthiness decision.\nA person who seeks access to sensitive information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence.  This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours.  The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to sensitive information.  Decisions include, by necessity, consideration\nof the possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard sensitive information.  Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nsensitive information.\nSection 7 of Executive Order (EO) 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin\nterms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty\nof the applicant concerned\u201d (See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple\nprerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information)).\nAnalysis\nGuideline B - Foreign Influence\nParagraph 6 of the new adjudicative guidelines sets out the security concern\nrelating to Foreign Influence: \u201cForeign contacts and interests may be a security concern\nif the individual has divided loyalties or foreign interests, may be manipulated or\ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a way that is\nnot in U.S. interests, or is vulnerable to pressure or coercion by a foreign interest.\u201d\n\n5\nHere, Paragraph 7(a) is applicable: \u201ccontacts with a foreign family member . . .\nwho is a citizen of or resident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened\nrisk of foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion.\u201d  The\nApplicant\u2019s parent\u2019s are dual nationals, but reside in Taiwan.  This is countered,\nhowever, by the first mitigating condition, as \u201cthe nature of the relationships with foreign\npersons, the country in which these persons are located . . . are such that it is unlikely\nthe individual will be placed in a position of having to choose between the interests of a\nforeign individual . . . and the interests of the U.S.\u201d  The Applicant averred credibly at\nhis hearing that, although he is very close to his mother, he could not be coerced by her\npresence in Taiwan by the Taiwanese government.  Furthermore, in the unlikely event\nthat were to occur; as they are U.S. citizens, they could easily return to the U.S.\nGuideline C - Foreign Preference\nParagraph 9 of the new adjudicative guidelines sets out the security concern\nrelating to Foreign Preference: \u201cWhen an individual acts in such a way as to indicate a\npreference for a foreign country over the United States, then he or she may be prone to\nprovide information or make decisions that are harmful to the interests of the United\nStates.\u201d\nHere, Paragraphs 10(a)(1) and (5) are applicable. \u201cexercise of any right, privilege\nor obligation of a foreign citizenship after becoming a U.S. citizen or through the foreign\ncitizenship of a family member.  This includes but is not limited to: (1) possession of a\ncurrent foreign passport; . . . (5) using foreign citizenship to protect financial or business\ninterests in another country.\u201d  Although mitigating condition under Paragraph 11(e) is\nclearly applicable, as Applicant\u2019s \u201cpassport has been . . . surrendered to the cognizant\nsecurity authority,\u201d I can not find that Paragraph 11(b) is also applicable.  At his hearing,\nalthough the Applicant \u201cexpressed a willingness to renounce dual citizenship,\u201d he was\nhesitant in this regard, at best.  It is clear that he wishes to retain his Taiwanese\ncitizenship to protect his financial interests as his parent\u2019s sole heir.\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a public trust position by considering the totality of the\nApplicant\u2019s conduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should\nconsider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature,\nextent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct,\nto include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct;\n(4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which\nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other\npermanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for\npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or\nrecurrence.\u201d Under AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility\nfor a public trust position must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon\ncareful consideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.\n\n6\nHe has the support of both his Branch Chief and his Team Leader, both of whom\nhave known the Applicant for two years.\nI considered all of the evidence, including the potentially disqualifying and\nmitigating conditions surrounding this case.  Overall, the record evidence leaves me\nwith questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a public trust\nposition.  For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant has not mitigated the\ntrustworthiness concerns arising from his Foreign Preference. \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline B:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nFor Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline C:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.b:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.c:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.d:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.e:\nFor Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a public trust\nposition.  Eligibility for access to sensitive information is denied.\nRichard A. Cefola\nAdministrative Judge\n\n7\n",

Mardula, Esquire\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nMETZ, John Grattan, Jr., Administrative Judge:\nOn 25 October 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA)\nissued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing security concerns under\nGuidelines B and C.  Applicant answered the SOR 12 November 2007, and requested a\n1\nhearing. DOHA assigned the case to me 26 December 2007, and I convened a hearing\n12 February 2008. DOHA received the transcript (Tr.) 21 February 2008.\n \nApril 30, 2008\n\n2\nFindings of Fact\nApplicant admitted the SOR allegations. He is a 72-year-old theoretical physicist\nemployed by a defense contractor since February 2003. When he was hired, his\nposition did not require him to have access to classified information, but his hiring was\nconditioned on his obtaining U.S. citizenship. He has not previously held a clearance.\nApplicant was born in Casablanca, Morocco in 1935, the son of two Italian\nexpatriates living and working in Morocco. In 1935, Morocco was a French protectorate,\nand Applicant was born an Italian citizen. However, when his father died while Applicant\nwas still a child, his mother became a French citizen, and Applicant derived French\ncitizenship from her. Applicant grew up in Morocco and was educated there through\nhigh school.\nIn 1959, Applicant was drafted into the French Army, and served two years in\nAlgeria, reaching the rank of sergeant. He is eligible, but has not applied, for a small\nmilitary retirement based on this service. After completing his military obligation,\nApplicant attended college in France, obtaining an undergraduate degree in\nmathematics, a master\u2019s degree in theoretical physics in 1969, and a doctoral degree in\ntheoretical physics in 1975. After obtaining his doctoral degree, he spent two years\ndoing post-doctorate work at a prestigious university in the U.S., where, he met the\nwoman he would later marry.\nApplicant worked for France\u2019s Center for Scientific Research (CSC) from 1973\nuntil his retirement in 2000, having served as a research director since the late 1980s.\nThe CSC\u2014like its U.S. counterpart, the National Science Foundation (NSF)\u2014is a\ngovernment-funded research organization. Although the projects Applicant worked on\ndid not involve classified information, the modeling programs he ran required him to be\ncleared for access to the most sophisticated computers the French government used,\nwhich themselves contained classified data. Applicant draws an annual pension of\n$50,000 from the French government for this 27 years of work. That income represents\nabout one-third of Applicant\u2019s current income, but will be about 50 percent of his annual\nincome once he retires from his current employment. He maintains a French bank\naccount for direct deposit of his retirement pay, but otherwise has no financial interests\nin France. He has $300,000 equity in his home in the U.S., and $400,000 in U.S.\ninvestments.\nApplicant married his wife\u2014a U.S. born citizen\u2014in July 1985, after she\nimmigrated to France. After meeting French residency requirements, she became a\nnaturalized French citizen in 1988 or 1989. She has both a French passport and a U.S.\npassport.\nAfter he retired from the CSC, Applicant immigrated to the U.S. using his French\npassport. He renewed his French passport as required under U.S. immigration law in\nApril 2002; it is valid until April 2012. He, and his wife, used their French passports to\ntravel to France in 2001 and 2006, and to St. Maarten\u2014part of the French overseas\n\n3\ndepartment of Guadalupe\u2014in 2007. Applicant stated an intent to renew his French\npassport to facilitate travel within the European Union (EU).\nApplicant started work with his current employer in February 2003, conditioned\non his obtaining U.S. citizenship. As the spouse of a U.S. citizen, he was eligible for\nU.S. citizenship after three years residence, and he became a naturalized U.S.\ncitizenship in January 2004. It seems that he did not contemplate obtaining U.S.\ncitizenship until it became an employment issue. He obtained his U.S. passport in June\n2004.\nApplicant maintains casual contact with many friends and professional\ncolleagues from the scientific community around the world, and in France. In 2005, he\nvoted in the French referendum\u2014ultimately rejected\u2014on ratifying the EU constitution.\nApplicant voted in the referendum (he was for ratification) because he thought it\nimportant for the EU He did not think it would be a problem for the U.S., and he is willing\nto refrain from voting in France if it is an issue.\nApplicant and his wife may consider living outside the U.S. after they retire,\npossibly in the Caribbean. They have no children together, and her children from an\nearlier marriage are all grown. Applicant is willing to surrender his French passport to\nobtain his clearance. His company has agreed to hold it if that is acceptable to the U.S.\ngovernment. He claims that his loyalties are to the U.S. and does not believe the French\ngovernment could exploit him. However, he is reluctant to renounce his French\ncitizenship, because he believes he would lose his French pension if he did. Similarly,\nhe would not have become a U.S. citizen if doing so would have put his pension at risk.\nApplicant\u2019s supervisor\u2014the man who hired him originally\u2014considers him an\nexcellent employee. Applicant has raised no security concerns while employed, and the\nsupervisor has no reason to doubt Applicant\u2019s loyalty to the U.S. When he hired\nApplicant, the company\u2019s work did not require Applicant to have a clearance.\nFrance is a democratic republic and close ally of the U.S. However, France is a\nknown practitioner of industrial espionage, for both military and commercial purposes.\nNevertheless, there is no evidence that France targets U.S. citizens for this information.\nPolicies\nThe Revised Adjudicative Guidelines (RAG) list factors to be considered in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for access to classified information. Administrative\nJudges must assess both disqualifying and mitigating conditions under each issue fairly\nraised by the facts and circumstances presented. Each decision must also reflect a fair\nand impartial common sense consideration of the factors listed in RAG \u00b6 2(a). The\npresence or absence of a disqualifying or mitigating condition is not determinative for or\nagainst Applicant. However, specific adjudicative guidelines should be followed where a\ncase can be measured against them, as they represent policy guidance governing the\n\nSee, Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518 (1988).\n2\nRevised Adjudicative Guidelines, \u00b6 6.\n3\nRevised Adjudicative Guidelines, \u00b6 7.(a).\n4\n4\ngrant or denial of access to classified information. Considering the SOR allegations and\nthe evidence as a whole, the relevant, applicable, adjudicative guidelines are  Guideline\nB (Foreign Influence) and Guideline C (Foreign Preference).\nSecurity clearance decisions resolve whether it is clearly consistent with the\nnational interest to grant or continue an Applicant\u2019s security clearance. The government\nmust prove, by something less than a preponderance of the evidence, controverted\nfacts alleged in the SOR. If it does so, it establishes a prima facie case against access\nto classified information. Applicant must then refute, extenuate, or mitigate the\ngovernment\u2019s case. Because no one has a right to a security clearance, the Applicant\nbears a heavy burden of persuasion.\nPersons with access to classified information enter into a fiduciary relationship\nwith the government based on trust and confidence. Therefore, the government has a\ncompelling interest in ensuring each Applicant possesses the requisite judgement,\nreliability, and trustworthiness of those who must protect national interests as their own.\nThe \u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d standard compels resolution of any\nreasonable doubt about an Applicant\u2019s suitability for access in favor of the government.2\nAnalysis\nUnder Guideline B (Foreign Influence), an applicant\u2019s foreign contacts and\ninterests may raise security concerns if the individual 1) has divided loyalties or foreign\nfinancial interests, 2) may be manipulated or induced to help a foreign person, group,\norganization, or government in a way contrary to U.S. interests, or 3) is vulnerable to\npressure or coercion by any foreign interest. Foreign influence adjudications can and\nshould consider the identity of the foreign country in which the foreign contact or\nfinancial interest is located\u2014including, but not limited to, whether the country is known\nto target U.S. citizens to obtain protected information and/or is associated with a risk of\nterrorism.  Evaluation of an individual\u2019s qualifications for access to protected information\n3\nrequires careful assessment of both the foreign entity\u2019s willingness and ability to target\nprotected information, and to target ex-patriots who are U.S. citizens to obtain that\ninformation, and the individual\u2019s susceptibility to influence, whether negative or positive.\nMore specifically, an individual\u2019s contacts with foreign family members (or other foreign\nentities or persons) raise security concerns only if those contacts create a heightened\nrisk or foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion.  In\n4\naddition, an individual\u2019s connections to a foreign government or country may create a\npotential conflict of interest between the individual\u2019s obligation to protect sensitive\ninformation or technology and the individual\u2019s desire to help a foreign country by\n\nRevised Adjudicative Guidelines, \u00b6 7.(b).\n5\nRevised Adjudicative Guidelines, \u00b6 7.(e).\n6\nRevised Adjudicative Guidelines, \u00b6 10.(a) exercise of any right, privilege, or obligation of foreign\n7\ncitizenship after becoming a U.S. citizen or through the foreign citizenship of a family member. This\nincluded but is not limited to: (1) possession of a current foreign passport; (2) military service . . . for a\nforeign country; (3) accepting . . . retirement . . .  or other such benefits from a foreign country; (5) using\nforeign citizenship to protect financial . . . interests in another country; (7) voting in a foreign election; (b)\naction to acquire or obtain recognition of a foreign citizenship by an American citizen;\n5\nproviding that information.  Finally, an individual\u2019s substantial financial interest in a\n5\nforeign country could subject an individual to a heightened risk of foreign influence or\nexploitation.6\nIn this case, the government established a case for disqualification under\nGuideline B regarding his direct, continuing contacts with friends and colleagues in\nFrance, and his financial reliance on the French government for a significant portion of\nhis annual income. Considering first the foreign country involved, France and the U.S.\nenjoy generally good foreign relations. Although France is not associated with a risk of\nterrorism or known to target U.S. citizens to obtain protected information, the fact that\nFrance is a known collector of U.S. intelligence or sensitive economic information\npresents security concerns. Applicant spent 80 percent of his adult life as a French\ncitizen, most of it working for the French government. His retirement is so recent that he\nis likely to still be remembered at his agency. Certainly he is well-known and well-\nregarded in the scientific community in which he moves. Applicant\u2019s situation raises the\nrisk of foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion by both\npositive and negative means because of appeals to his friendships and loyalties to\nFrance, coupled with hints about consequences for his pension. Applicant stated his\nown concern that renouncing his French citizenship would cost him his pension, and\nindicated that he would not have obtained U.S. citizenship if it risked losing his pension.\nThe scenario for foreign influence is neither speculative nor fanciful. I resolve Guideline\nB against Applicant.\nThe government established a case for disqualification under Guideline C by\nshowing that Applicant has been a U.S. citizen only since January 2004, became a U.S.\ncitizen largely for employment reasons, and possesses, uses, renewed, and intends to\nrenew a French passport. He served in the French military and government, retains his\nFrench citizenship to preserve his pension, and has voted in French elections since\nbecoming a U.S. citizen.  Applicant has not mitigated the Guideline C security concerns.\n7\nHe has been a dual citizen of France and the United States only since January 2004.\nHis dual citizenship cannot reasonably be said to be based solely on his parents\u2019\ncitizenship or birth in a foreign country where all but four years of his life were spent as\na citizen of either Italy or France. The circumstances of his acquiring U.S. citizenship\nalso suggest a preference for a foreign nation over the United States. Further, inimical\nintent or detrimental impact on the interests of the United States is not required before\nthe government can seek to deny access under Guideline C. The government has a\n\nRevised Adjudicative Guidelines, \u00b6 11.(a) dual citizenship is based solely on parents\u2019 citizenship or birth\n8\nin a foreign country;\n\u00b6 11.(b) the individual has expressed a willingness to renounce dual citizenship;\n9\nHowever the exercise of French citizenship over more than 40 years of his adult life, and the resulting\n10\npension, tie him permanently to France in ways most naturalized U.S. citizens do not experience.\n\u00b6 11.(c) exercise of the rights, privileges, or obligations of foreign citizenship occurred before the\n11\nindividual became a U.S. citizen or when the individual was a minor;\n\u00b6 11.(d) use of a foreign passport is approved by the cognizant security authority;\n12\n\u00b6 11.(e) the passport has been destroyed, surrendered to the cognizant security authority, or otherwise\n13\ninvalidated; \n6\ncompelling interest in ensuring those given public trust positions will make decisions\nfree of concerns for the foreign country of which they may also be a citizen.\n \nApplicant\u2019s information supports none of the mitigating conditions (MC) for\nforeign preference. His dual citizenship is not based solely on his parents\u2019 citizenship,\nbut is based on his active exercise of dual citizenship after becoming a naturalized U.S.\ncitizen.  He has not expressed a willingness to renounce his foreign citizenship.  While\n8\n9\nthe vast majority of his exercises of French citizenship occurred before he became a\nU.S. citizen,  significant  exercise of dual citizenship occurred after he obtained U.S.\n10\ncitizenship, while he was an adult.  Applicant's use of his French passport has not been\n11\nsanctioned by the U.S.  He stated only conditional willingness to invalidate his\n12\npassport, and had previously stated an intent to retain it.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact DOHA alleged that Applicant owes delinquent debt totaling $35,186 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.z), including five outstanding judgments (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b, 1.k, 1.l, 1.m). In her Answer, Applicant admitted several of the debts (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.j, 1.r, 1.s, 1.v, 1.w, 1.z), but she denied others (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.k, 1.l, 1.o, 1.p, 1.q, 1.t, 1.u, 1.y). Applicant acknowledged she has a poor credit rating but it was a \u201chard struggle\u201d being a single mother with a child in daycare. She added that she had taken measures to improve her financial situation. She moved in with her mother, signed up for an online credit counseling course, disputed some items on her credit report, asked for old debts to be removed from her credit report, and contacted the assignee of her student loan debt to make payment arrangements (Item 3). After a review of the government\u2019s FORM, including Applicant\u2019s Answer, I make the following findings of fact: Applicant is 31 years old and an employee of a TRICARE managed care support contractor since December 2004. She had worked in provider relations for the previous support contractor from mid-April 2003 to late June 2004 (Item 4). She requires access to sensitive health care information so that she can assist TRICARE Prime beneficiaries needing prior authorization for civilian health care (Item 3). Applicant attended two years of college from 1995 to 1997 (Item 3). She took out four federal student loans: two in March 1996 in the amounts of $2,126 (SOR \u00b6 1.d) and $2,625 (",

On November 15, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA)\nissued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant, detailing the trustworthiness\nconcerns under Guideline F. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865,\nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended,\nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security\nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); Department of\nDefense (DoD) Regulation 5200.2-R, Personnel Security Program, dated Jan. 1987, as\namended (Regulation), and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the\nPresident on December 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for\nSORs issued after September 1, 2006.\nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on January 3, 2008, and requested a\ndecision on the written record without a hearing. On February 25, 2008, the government\nsubmitted a File of Relevant Material (FORM) consisting of eight exhibits (Items 1-8).\nDOHA forwarded a copy of the FORM to Applicant and instructed her to respond within\n30 days of receipt. Applicant did not respond by the March 30, 2008, due date. On May\nMay 22, 2008\n\n2\n2, 2008, the case was assigned to me to consider whether it is clearly consistent with\nthe national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for her. Based upon a\nreview of the FORM, including Applicant\u2019s Answer to the SOR (Item 3), eligibility for a\npublic trust position is denied.\nFindings of Fact\nDOHA alleged that Applicant owes delinquent debt totaling $35,186 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6\n1.a-1.z), including five outstanding judgments (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b, 1.k, 1.l, 1.m). In her\nAnswer, Applicant admitted several of the debts (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.j, 1.r, 1.s, 1.v, 1.w, 1.z),\nbut she denied others (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.k, 1.l, 1.o, 1.p, 1.q, 1.t, 1.u, 1.y). Applicant\nacknowledged she has a poor credit rating but it was a \u201chard struggle\u201d being a single\nmother with a child in daycare. She added that she had taken measures to improve her\nfinancial situation. She moved in with her mother, signed up for an online credit\ncounseling course, disputed some items on her credit report, asked for old debts to be\nremoved from her credit report, and contacted the assignee of her student loan debt to\nmake payment arrangements (Item 3). After a review of the government\u2019s FORM,\nincluding Applicant\u2019s Answer, I make the following findings of fact:\nApplicant is 31 years old and an employee of a TRICARE managed care support\ncontractor since December 2004. She had worked in provider relations for the previous\nsupport contractor from mid-April 2003 to late June 2004 (Item 4). She requires access\nto sensitive health care information so that she can assist TRICARE Prime beneficiaries\nneeding prior authorization for civilian health care (Item 3).\nApplicant attended two years of college from 1995 to 1997 (Item 3). She took out\nfour federal student loans: two in March 1996 in the amounts of $2,126 (SOR \u00b6 1.d)\nand $2,625 (SOR \u00b6 1.e), one in October 1996 of $2,625 (SOR \u00b6 1.f), and one in\nFebruary 1997 of $4,000 (SOR \u00b6 1.c) In Spring 1997, she also received an $800 grant\ncheck from the university (SOR \u00b6 1.k). The grant was not funded. She did not return the\ngrant monies and the university eventually obtained a judgment against her in\nSeptember 2002 for $716 (Items 5, 6, 7, 8).\nIn September 1997, Applicant began working as an office manager (Item 3). She\nbroke her apartment lease when she relocated for her job, and the landlord eventually\nobtained a judgment of $669 against her in May 2000 (SOR \u00b6 1.a) (Item 5). She was\nunemployed from February 2000 to October 2000 (Item 4) and made no effort to repay\nthe judgment (Item 5). She also fell behind in an automobile loan taken out in\nDecember 1998 because of her lack of income, and the 1990 model vehicle was\nrepossessed in August 2000 (Items 5, 7). In April 2001, the lender obtained a judgment\nagainst her in the amount of $2,814 (SOR \u00b6 1.b). A $151 unpaid medical debt was\nplaced for collection in August 2000 (not alleged) (Items 5, 6, 7, 8).\nFrom mid-October 2000 until March 2002, Applicant worked as a customer\nservice representative. She got married in June 2001 (Item 4), but it cannot be\ndetermined from the available record whether her spouse contributed financially to the\nhousehold. Applicant was consistently employed, but she defaulted on her student loan\n\nThe government alleged a $297 debt in collection for a computer (SOR \u00b6 1.o). However, the credit reports\n1\nshow two debts for collection with the same assignee. The account opened with the original creditor named\nin SOR \u00b6 1.o had a $2,886 past due balance as of November 2006 (Item 7). The $297 debt that was alleged\nin \u00b6 1.o was placed with the assignee by a telephone provider in January 2005 (Item 8).\nOn her SF 85P, Applicant inconsistently listed a period of unemployment from January 14, 2003 to April 16,\n2\n2004, but also that she worked in provider relations in military healthcare from April 17, 2003 to June 20, 2004\n(Item 4). In her Answer (Item 3), Applicant indicated that she has worked for her previous employer for three\nyears after having worked on the previous contract for 18 months. It appears that Applicant was unemployed\nonly from January 24, 2003 to April 16, 2003.\n3\ndebt (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c, 1.d, 1.e, 1.f). The delinquent student loans were referred for\ncollection in September 2001, and in May 2002 a delinquent debt of $2,886 (not\nalleged) was placed for collection   (Items 7, 8). \n1\nApplicant was again unemployed from mid-March 2002 to October 2002. Her\nspouse was supposed to make payments on an automobile loan in her name, but he\nfailed to do so. In January 2003, the creditor obtained a $4,962 judgment against her\n(SOR \u00b6 1.m) (Items 5, 7, 8). Applicant also incurred medical costs not covered by\ninsurance that she did not pay. In 2002, delinquent medical debt totaling $857 was\nplaced for collection (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.g, 1.h, 1.i, 1.j). In September 2002, a judgment was\nawarded to a collection agency seeking to collect another $3,082 in unpaid medical\ndebt (SOR \u00b6 1.l) (Items 6, 7, 8).\nApplicant stopped working in January 2003 on the birth of her daughter (Item 4).\nIn March 2003, another $239 in delinquent medical debt was referred for collection\n(SOR \u00b6 1.n). In about April 2003, Applicant began working in the military healthcare\nindustry.  In October 2003, Applicant took out a personal loan of about $1,000 for\n2\nhurricane expenses (Item 5). That same month, she and her spouse separated (Item\n4). Applicant subsequently defaulted on the loan and a $425 debt balance was charged\noff in August 2004 (SOR \u00b6 1.s) (Items 6, 7). Applicant claims that her spouse had been\narrested for check fraud and she had been forced to reimburse the bank so was unable\nto make her loan payments (Item 5). Several delinquent cable/telephone accounts were\nreferred for collection around this time as well:  in December 2003 for $485 (SOR \u00b6\n1.p), in March 2004 for $1,373 (SOR \u00b6 1.q) in charges run up on her account by her\nspouse after they separated (Item 5), also in March 2004 for $85 (SOR \u00b6 1.r), and in\nJanuary 2005 for $297 (SOR \u00b6 1.o) (Items 7, 8). In April 2005, a $120 credit card debt\nwas placed for collection (SOR \u00b6 1.u) (Items 6, 7). Additional medical debt totaling $181\nwas placed for collection in 2006 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.v, 1.w, 1.z) (Items 6, 7, 8).\nOn October 24, 2005, Applicant completed a SF 85P on which she disclosed\nthat financial judgments had been obtained against her in January 2003 (SOR \u00b6 1.m)\nand September 2002 (SOR \u00b6 1.l). As to whether she was now over 180 days delinquent\non any loan or financial obligation, Applicant listed a student loan incurred in December\n1996 (Item 4). A check of Applicant\u2019s credit in December 2005 revealed three additional\njudgments against her (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b, 1.k), and several other debts in collection not\ndisputed by Applicant (SOR \u00b6 1.g, 1.h, 1.i, 1.j, 1.v, 1.w) as well as debts of $297 (SOR \u00b6\n1.o), $485 (SOR \u00b6 1.p), $1,373 (SOR \u00b6 1.q) and $155 (SOR \u00b6 1.t) that she now\n\n4\ndisputes (Item 8). A check of her credit one year later showed no progress toward\nresolving her delinquent debt (Item 7).\nOn March 21, 2007, Applicant was interviewed by a government investigator\nabout her credit issues. Applicant admitted the judgments in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b, 1.k, and\n1.m were still unpaid. She claimed to have no knowledge of the judgment in SOR 1.l,\nbut also admitted she had not paid medical deductibles/co-pays and had been\ncontacted by the creditor who held the $3,082 judgment. She did not deny her\nresponsibility for the $2,814 for the repossessed car (SOR \u00b6 1.b), the student loans\n(SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c-1.f), the personal loan (SOR 1.s), or the computer debt (reported by the\ncredit bureaus as $2,687 past due). She averred the $120 collection debt (SOR \u00b6 1.u)\nwas likely a VISA account. Applicant claimed to have paid about $1,500 toward her\nstudent loans and stated she was in the process of arranging for repayment of the\n$14,000 aggregate balance. She indicated there was \u201cno specific reason as to why the\nloans went into default.\u201d Applicant denied any knowledge of some of the debts listed on\nher credit report, including a $362 telephone debt placed for collection in March 2006\n(SOR 1.x) and a $155 debt placed for collection in January 2005 (SOR \u00b6 1.t), and she\ndisputed the $1,373 cable/phone debt (SOR \u00b6 1.q) because her spouse had run up the\ndebt on her account after they separated. She indicated that most of the other debts\nwould be resolved through a planned bankruptcy filing. Applicant added that she had\nrecently opened a new credit card account on which she was current (Item 5).\nAs of June 2007, the aggregate balance of Applicant\u2019s delinquent student loans\nwas about $17,461 (Item 6). In July 2007, Applicant took out an automobile loan of\n$11,244, to be repaid at $390 per month. Her account was current as of September\n2007 (Item 6). As of October 2007, Equifax Information Services was reporting $11,574\nin judgment debt (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b, 1.k, 1.l, 1.m), $4,052 in unpaid inactive collection debt\n(\u00b6\u00b6 1.g-1.j, 1.n, 1.q, 1.t-1.x, 1.z), three open collection debts totaling $1,285 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6\n1.n, 1.r, 1.y), the $17,461 in student loan debt, and the $425 personal loan debt (SOR \u00b6\n1.s). The $669 judgment debt (SOR \u00b6 1.a) had been dropped by Equifax from her credit\nreport, although there is no indication it has been paid.\nOn December 31, 2007, Applicant notified the three credit bureaus that she was\ndisputing several debts (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.k, 1.l, 1.o, 1,p, 1.q, 1.t, 1.u, 1.x, 1.y), and she asked\nthat they be removed from her credit record. She also asked that any reference to the\n$669 judgment (SOR \u00b6 1.a) be deleted as it was over seven years old (Item 3). On\nJanuary 3, 2008, Applicant told DOHA that she had signed up for online credit\ncounseling, disputed those accounts that she did not recognize, and contacted the\nassignee of her defaulted student loans to arrange for repayment. She expressed her\nintent to repay the remaining debts through consolidation (Item 3).\nApplicant\u2019s supervisor has had an opportunity to assess her work for the past\ntwo years. She has been impressed by Applicant\u2019s \u201chard work, dedication, and\ntrustworthiness.\u201d In 2007, Applicant was selected to participate in a high level project\ndue to her knowledge, reliability, and excellent customer service (Item 3).\n\n5\nPolicies\nPositions designated as ADP I and ADP II are classified as \u201csensitive positions.\u201d\n(See Regulation \u00b6\u00b6 C3.1.2.1.1.7 and C3.1.2.1.2.3.)  \u201cThe standard that must be met for\n. . . assignment to sensitive duties is that, based on all available information, the\nperson\u2019s loyalty, reliability, and trustworthiness are such that . . . assigning the person to\nsensitive duties is clearly consistent with the interests of national security.\u201d (See\nRegulation \u00b6 C6.1.1.1.) The Deputy Under Secretary of Defense (Counterintelligence\nand Security) Memorandum, dated November 19, 2004, indicates trustworthiness\nadjudications will apply to cases forwarded to DOHA by the Defense Security Service\nand Office of Personnel Management.  Department of Defense contractor personnel\nare afforded the right to the procedures contained in the Directive before any final\nunfavorable access determination may be made. (See Regulation \u00b6 C8.2.1.)  \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a public trust position, the\nadministrative judge must consider the disqualifying and mitigating conditions in the\nAdjudicative Guidelines (AG). These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead,\nrecognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in\nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative\njudge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision.\nAccording to AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of\nvariables known as the \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider\nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and\nunfavorable, in making a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\n[sensitive] information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based\non the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable\ntrustworthiness decision.\nA person who seeks access to sensitive information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\ngovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to sensitive information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of\nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard sensitive information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\n\n6\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nsensitive information.\n \nSection 7 of Executive Order (EO) 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin\nterms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty\nof the applicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple\nprerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information).  \nAnalysis\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nThe trustworthiness concern relating to the guideline for financial considerations\nis set out in AG & 18:\nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to\nprotect \n[sensitive] \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially\noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate\nfunds. \nApplicant has a record of serious financial delinquency since the late 1990s. Five\ncourt judgments were obtained against her between 2000 and 2003, totaling $12,243.\nShe also defaulted on her federal student loan debt, which has accumulated to about\n$17,461. Furthermore, Applicant did not make her payments on several phone/cable\nservice accounts. Assuming that her spouse ran up $1,373 in phone charges after they\nseparated, she showed poor judgment in not cancelling the account. She also did not\nmake her medical co-pays or deductible amounts and accumulated about $1,360 in\ndelinquent medical debt. AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) (\u201cinability or unwillingness to satisfy debts\u201d) and\n19(c) (\u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations\u201d) apply.\nApplicant\u2019s financial problems are too pervasive and too recent to satisfy AG \u00b6\n20(a) (\u201cthe behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such\ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s\ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment\u201d). Five delinquent accounts were\nreferred for collection in 2006. Applicant\u2019s failure to make her payments on so many\ndifferent types of debt (car loans, student loans, the personal loan, cable/phone bills, an\napartment rental, and medical co-pays) raises considerable concerns about her ability\nto manage her financial obligations.\nApplicant submits in mitigation the struggles of being a single mother with a child\nin daycare, and instability in employment before her current job (Item 3). The economic\nburden of raising a child as a single parent, unemployment, as well as medical costs\nare circumstances contemplated within AG \u00b6 20(b) (\u201cthe conditions that resulted in the\nfinancial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a\n\n7\nbusiness downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or\nseparation).\u201d There is no evidence that Applicant has received any child support, and\nmedical costs are not a discretionary expense. Applicant was unemployed from\nFebruary to October 2000, mid-March to October 2002, and January to April 2003.\nAlthough she did not explain in detail its impact on her financial situation (for example,\nthere is no indication whether she collected unemployment or social service benefits), it\nreasonably explains her failure to remain current on her obligations. However, for AG \u00b6\n20(b) to fully apply, Applicant must also have \u201cacted responsibly under the\ncircumstances.\u201d Applicant has worked for her current employer for the past three years\nbut made no payments on her debts, some of which are as little as $50. She has not\npresented any evidence that could justify her inattention to her indebtedness. As of May\n2007, she knew the government was concerned about her credit issues, and she\nindicated that she planned to file for bankruptcy, would consolidate her other debts, and\nhad made a payment on her student loans as recently as 2006. However, there is no\nevidence of the claimed $1,500 in payments on her student loans, and her October\n2007 credit report does not show any progress toward resolving the debts.\nIn December 2007, Applicant indicated that she had taken steps to improve her\nfinancial situation. According to her SF 85P, Applicant has resided with her mother\nsince September 2005. Yet it is not enough to implicate AG \u00b6 20(d) (\u201cthe individual\ninitiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts\u201d)\nwhere she has not devoted any of the monies saved to her old debts. Promises to pay\nor to resolve indebtedness through a possible bankruptcy do not substitute for concrete\naction. There is no evidence that she has completed any counseling, online or in\nperson, even if she has registered for an online course. Applicant also has not\nadequately demonstrated that she has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of\nthose debts that she now disputes. While she now contests her liability for two of the\njudgments and seeks removal of a third from her credit report based on the passage of\ntime, she did not meet her burden of disproving her legal responsibility. She admitted to\na government investigator in May 2007 that the $716 judgment was for a grant that was\nnever funded, the $669 judgment resulted from her terminating an apartment lease\nprematurely, and that she had not paid for some medical services. The credit reports\nconfirm the $3,082 judgment is for unpaid medical costs. She expressed her belief that\nthe $120 debt was for a VISA account. AG \u00b6 20(e) (\u201cthe individual has a reasonable\nbasis to dispute the legitimacy of the past-due debt which is the cause of the problem\nand provides documented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides\nevidence of actions to resolve the issue\u201d) cannot be applied based on the available\nrecord. \nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a public trust position by considering the totality of the\nApplicant\u2019s conduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should\nconsider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature,\nextent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct,\nto include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct;\n\n8\n(4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which\nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other\npermanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for\npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or\nrecurrence.\u201d Under AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility\nfor a public trust position must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon\ncareful consideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.       \nI considered the disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and\ncircumstances surrounding this case.  While Applicant\u2019s financial situation was likely\nimpacted by her unemployment, the government must be assured that those persons in\nsensitive positions can be counted on to exercise good judgment at all times. She\nremains under a significant debt burden that is not likely to be resolved in the near\nfuture given her track record of disregard. Applicant indicates that she has learned a\nhard lesson because of her poor credit, and she does not want to be punished further\nby losing her employment. Without an income, Applicant would not be in a position to\naddress her debts. At the same time, the issue before me is whether it is clearly\nconsistent with the national interest for her to hold a position of trust. While she has\ndemonstrated reliability and trustworthiness on the job, it is not enough to overcome the\nfinancial considerations concerns.\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.f:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.g:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.h:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.i:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.j:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.k:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.l:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.m:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.n:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.o:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.p:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.q:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.r:\nAgainst Applicant\n\n9\nSubparagraph 1.s:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.t:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.u:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.v:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.w:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.x:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.y:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.z:\nAgainst Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a public trust\nposition.

On November 5, 2008, the\nDefense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR)\ndetailing the security concerns under Guideline G concerning the Applicant.  The action\nwas taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within\nIndustry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6,\nDefense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as\namended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by\nPresident Bush on December 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense\nfor SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n \nApplicant submitted an Answer to the SOR on November 21, 2008, and\nrequested a hearing before an Administrative Judge.  Department Counsel was\nprepared to proceed on December 19, 2008.  The case was assigned to another\nAdministrative Judge on December 22, 2008.  I received the case assignment on\nJanuary 8, 2009.  DOHA issued a notice of hearing on January 9, 2009, and I convened\n\n2\nthe hearing as scheduled on February 6, 2009.  The Government offered Government\nExhibits 1 through 4, which were received without objection. Applicant testified on his\nown behalf and called three additional witnesses.  DOHA received the transcript of the\nhearing on February 12, 2009.  Based upon a review of the case file, pleadings,\nexhibits, and testimony, eligibility for access to classified information is granted.\nFindings of Fact\nThe Applicant is 54 and married.  He is employed by a defense contractor and\nseeks to retain a security clearance previously granted in connection with his\nemployment.\nGuideline G - Alcohol Consumption\nThe Government alleges in this paragraph that the Applicant is ineligible for\nclearance because he uses intoxicants to excess.  The Applicant admitted the factual\nallegations in subparagraphs 1.b. and 1.c. of the SOR.  Those admissions are hereby\ndeemed findings of fact.  \nThe Applicant has had two alcohol related arrests - in 2003 and 2007.  The\nApplicant began drinking when he was a teenager.  He would drink to intoxication on an\ninfrequent basis, maybe once or twice a year.  The Applicant basically stopped drinking\nin August 2007, with the exception of part of one beer.  It is also worth noting that the\nApplicant had gastric bypass surgery in 2002 and 2006, reducing his weight from about\n300 pounds to 150 pounds.  The surgery severely limits the ability of his body to\nprocess alcohol.  (Transcript at 80-81.)  The Applicant worked for his company from\n1989 through 1999.  He then went to work for a second firm until 2006.  At that time he\nreturned to his original employer and has worked for them ever since.  Finally, the\nApplicant works at a remote location away from his home during the work week, with a\nsmall cadre of co-workers.  \nThe first alcohol related arrest of the Applicant occurred in June 2003.  The\nApplicant was working out of his home state.  He had been having dinner and drinking\nwine with some work associates.  After dinner, he was stopped by police for Driving\nUnder the Influence (DUI).  He hired an attorney and, after several trips to this state,\nplead guilty to the charge of Obstructing the Highway.  His sentence included a fine,\nprobation and to attend alcohol courses.  The Applicant successfully completed the\ncourses.  (Transcript at 71-76; Government Exhibit 4 at 3-4.)\nThe Applicant\u2019s second alcohol related arrest happened in February 2007.  This\nwas a difficult year.  Both of the Applicant\u2019s parents were seriously ill and would pass\naway later that year, in addition, the Applicant\u2019s wife was also suffering from long-term\nhealth problems.  On the day in question the Applicant had met a former neighbor.  He\nand the neighbor had some alcoholic drinks while they talked at a bar about the\nApplicant\u2019s problems.  After he left the restaurant, the Applicant was stopped by police\nand arrested for Driving Under the Influence.  The Applicant eventually plead guilty to\n\n3\nhaving a blood alcohol level above .08%.  His sentence included a fine, three years\nsummary probation, and attend a first offender DUI program.  He successfully\ncompleted the program.  The probation is due to end in October 2010.  The Applicant\nhas stated that this was an unusual situation and that he is not an irresponsible person.\n(Transcript at 76-84; Government Exhibit 3 and Exhibit 4 at 5-6.)\nSince the 2007 incident the Applicant has virtually stopped drinking alcohol.  He\nhad a few sips of beer on one occasion.  He does not intend to drink in the future,\nfinding no interest in it.  He attends AA meetings occasionally, but does not believe he\nhas an alcohol problem.  (Transcript at 84-89, 96-99.)\nMitigation\nThree co-workers of the Applicant testified.  The Facility Security Officer of the\nApplicant\u2019s company testified.  He has worked for the company since 1989, and has\nknown the Applicant for most of that time.  The witness testified that the Applicant is an\noutstanding employee and should retain his security clearance.  He further stated, \u201cIf I\nthought [the Applicant] had an ongoing issue with alcohol, I wouldn\u2019t be here.\u201d\n(Transcript at 18-30.)\nA co-worker who is a personal friend of the Applicant\u2019s also testified.  He has\nalso known the Applicant since 1989.  He stated that the Applicant is an excellent\nemployee, very trustworthy, and recommended that the Applicant retain his security\nclearance.  (Transcript at 33-45.)\nThe Applicant\u2019s immediate supervisor also testified on his behalf.  This person\nhas known the Applicant since 2006.  The supervisor testified that the Applicant is a\nvaluable employee, above average very trustworthy and honorable.  The witness has\nconsiderable personal experience with people with alcohol problems, and sees no\nevidence of that with the Applicant.  He also recommends that the Applicant retain his\nsecurity clearance.  (Transcript at 47-65.)  \nPolicies\nSecurity clearance decisions are not made in a vacuum.  When evaluating an\nApplicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the Administrative Judge must consider\nthe revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief introductory explanations for\neach guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially disqualifying conditions and\nmitigating conditions, which are useful in evaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access\nto classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6\n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as\n\n4\nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available,\nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in\nmaking a decision.  In addition, the Administrative Judge may also rely on his own\ncommon sense, as well as his knowledge of the law, human nature, and the ways of the\nworld, in making a reasoned decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Security clearance decisions include, by\nnecessity, consideration of the possible risk that the Applicant may deliberately or\ninadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a\ncertain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk\nof compromise of classified information.\n \nFinally, as emphasized by President Eisenhower in Section 7 of Executive Order\n10865, \u201cAny determination under this order . . . shall be a determination in terms of the\nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \nAnalysis\nGuideline G - Alcohol Consumption\nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Alcohol Consumption is set out\nin AG & 21:      \nExcessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of\nquestionable judgment or the failure to control impulses, and can raise\nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness.\n\n5\nThe Applicant was involved in two alcohol related incidents in 2003 and 2007.\nThe evidence also shows that the Applicant has used alcohol, occasionally to excess,\nfrom about 1970 until February 2007.  With one minor exception, he has not drank since\nthat date.\nThere are two Disqualifying Conditions that arguably apply to this case.  AG \u00b6\n22(a) \u201cAlcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while under the\ninfluence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or other incidents of\nconcern, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed as an alcohol abuser or\nalcohol dependent.\u201d  In addition, AG \u00b6 22(c) states a concern is, \u201cHabitual or binge\nconsumption of alcohol to the point of impaired judgment, regardless of whether the\nindividual is diagnosed as an alcohol abuser or alcohol dependent.\u201d  \nUnder the particular facts of this case, the following mitigating condition currently\napplies to the Applicant\u2019s situation. AG \u00b6 23(a) states that it can be a mitigating\nconditions when, \u201cSo much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or it\nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast\ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness or good judgment.\u201d\nThe record shows that the Applicant had two alcohol related incidents within four\nyears.  While certainly nothing to be taken lightly, there is, in my opinion, no evidence of\na pattern of abuse here.  His last incident occurred two years before the record closed\nand he has abstained from alcohol use since that time.  What is particularly telling is the\ncompelling, credible, testimony of the Applicant\u2019s three witnesses, including his direct\nsupervisor.  These people have intimate knowledge of the Applicant and his conduct on\nand off the job, and all recommend him for a position of trust and see no evidence of an\nalcohol problem.  This mitigating condition applies and, when viewed along with the\nWhole Person Concept discussion below, supports a finding for the Applicant.\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances.  The Administrative Judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness\nof the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include\nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which participation\nis voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent\nbehavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure,\ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d\nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security\nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration\nof the guidelines and the whole person concept.\n       \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case.  The Applicant is a hard-working,\n\n6\nrespected, professional person who has had two alcohol related incidents in his life.\nThere is little to no evidence that these incidents show a pattern, or that he is alcohol\ndependent or an alcohol abuser.  In viewing all the facts of this case, I find that the\nApplicant has mitigated the security significance of his prior conduct.  As set forth at\nlength above, I find that the conduct was not recent (AG \u00b6 2(a)(3)); that there have been\npermanent behavioral changes under AG \u00b6 2(a)(6); and that the likelihood of\ncontinuation or recurrence is close to nil (AG \u00b6 2(a)(9). \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with no questions and/or doubts as to\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I\nconclude the Applicant has mitigated the security concerns arising from his alcohol\nrelated incidents.  \nOn balance, it is concluded that the Applicant has successfully overcome the\nGovernment's case opposing his request for a DoD security clearance.  Accordingly, the\nevidence supports a finding for the Applicant as to the factual and conclusionary\nallegations expressed in Paragraph 1 of the Government's Statement of Reasons. \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline G:\nFOR THE APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nFor the Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nFor the Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.c:\nFor the Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is granted.\n                                              \nWILFORD H. ROSS\nAdministrative Judge\n",

    "summary": "Findings of Fact. Findings of Fact In her Answer to the SOR, dated December 10, 2007, Applicant admitted the factual allegations in \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b of the SOR. Those admissions are incorporated into the following findings: Applicant is 50 years old. She was born in Iraq. She attended high school and undergraduate college there, earning a Bachelor of Arts Degree in Education with a minor in Psychology. In 1975, at the age of 18, she married her husband, an Iraqi resident and citizen. At an early age, she expressed an interest in immigrating to the United States and began studying English in contemplation of that move. In 1978, Applicant and her husband immigrated to the United States.1 She was 21 years old. She and her husband became naturalized U.S. citizen in March 1991. They have a 21 year-old son, who was born in the United States. After arriving here, she and her husband bought property and started an automobile business that he continues to own and operate.

Murphy, Esquire, Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Dale Saran, Esquire \n \n \n______________ \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \n \nDAM, Shari, Administrative Judge: \n \n \nBased upon a review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility \nfor access to classified information is granted. \n \nOn June 17, 2005, Applicant submitted her Security Clearance Application (SF \n86). On November 16, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) \nissued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant, detailing the security concerns \nunder Guideline B (Foreign Influence). The action was taken under Executive Order \n10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as \namended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel \nSecurity Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the \nrevised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, \n2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September \n1, 2006.  \n  \n \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on December 10, 2007, and requested a \ndecision be issued without a hearing. On January 8, 2008, she withdrew her previous \nrequest and elected to have a hearing before an administrative judge. I received the \nApril 30, 2008\n\n \n \n \n \n2\ncase assignment on January 25, 2008.  DOHA issued a Notice of Hearing on March 10, \n2008, and I convened the hearing as scheduled on April 1, 2008. The Government \noffered Exhibits (GE) 1 through 4 into evidence without objection. Applicant testified, \ncalled three witnesses, and submitted exhibits (DE) A through I without objection. \nDOHA received the transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on April 11, 2008.  \n \nProcedural and Evidentiary Rulings \n \nRequest for Administrative Notice \n \nDepartment Counsel submitted a formal request that I take administrative notice \nof certain facts relating to Iraq. (Tr. 18). The request and the attached documents were \nnot admitted into evidence but were included in the record as Administrative Notice \nExhibits (Exh.) I through V. Applicant\u2019s counsel did not object to my consideration of \nthose Exhibits. (Id.). Hence, the facts administratively noticed are limited to matters of \ngeneral knowledge and matters not subject to reasonable dispute. Those facts are set \nout in the Findings of Fact.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn her Answer to the SOR, dated December 10, 2007, Applicant admitted the \nfactual allegations in \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b of the SOR.  Those admissions are incorporated \ninto the following findings: \n \n \nApplicant is 50 years old. She was born in Iraq. She attended high school and \nundergraduate college there, earning a Bachelor of Arts Degree in Education with a \nminor in Psychology. In 1975, at the age of 18, she married her husband, an Iraqi \nresident and citizen. At an early age, she expressed an interest in immigrating to the \nUnited States and began studying English in contemplation of that move.  \n \n \nIn 1978, Applicant and her husband immigrated to the United States.1 She was \n21 years old. She and her husband became naturalized U.S. citizen in March 1991. \nThey have a 21 year-old son, who was born in the United States. After arriving here, \nshe and her husband bought property and started an automobile business that he \ncontinues to own and operate. From May 1994 to August 2001, she was the office \nmanager for the company. She subsequently worked as a teaching assistant for a local \nMontessori school. (DE A).  In May 2004, she and her husband separated and in \nNovember 2006 they divorced. As part of the divorce decree, she received a cash \nsettlement that she placed in the bank. Her son lives with her former husband and \nworks in the business. \n \n \nAfter separating from her husband in 2004, Applicant began looking for full time \nemployment.  Cognizant of her strong language skills and knowledge of Iraqi culture \nand customs, she decided to apply for a position with Operation Iraqi Freedom, in order \n                                                          \n1 Saddam Hussein was not president of Iraq in 1978.  \n\n \n \n \n \n3\nto help our troops.  In early 2005, she completed an application for an Arabic linguist \nposition with a federal contractor that provided assistance to U.S. Army troops in Iraq. \nShe was hired and then sent for a couple weeks of training. In July 2005, she returned \nto a major Iraqi city where she was assigned duties as an interpreter for the military \nintelligence division. In that position, she performed interrogations and medical \nscreenings for detainees. She remained there for nine months, before returning home \nfor a short vacation. In February 2006, she went to another city in Iraq and performed \nscreenings of individuals that were seeking admittance to the base. She stayed there for \none year before going home for a short vacation. Over all, she worked in Iraq for two \nand a half years. (Tr. 85). \n \n \nAccording to Department of Defense policy that governs federal contractors, \nApplicant was not permitted to leave the bases where she worked in Iraq. (Tr. 88). She \nabided by that rule. She received an interim Secret Clearance and had access to \nclassified information while performing her duties in Iraq. (Tr. 85-86). There is no \nevidence in the record that while holding a security clearance in Iraq, she breached any \nsecurity policies. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s elderly parents were born in Iraq and reside there. She is one of three \nchildren, all born in Iraq. Her parents are Catholic. Her two brothers are married and \nresident citizens of Iraq. Both of them served in the Iraqi army, as did her husband, as \nrequired under Iraqi law. Her parents are retired. Her father, age 76, was a salesman \nand her mother, age 74, was a registered nurse, who worked for the Iraqi government. \nShe currently collects a government pension. (Tr. 103-105). Her brothers, along with \ntheir families, live with her parents. One of her brothers works in a government office \nand the other brother works as an accountant for a hospital. One of them is seeking to \nimmigrate to Canada. (Tr. 108-109). \n \n \nAfter leaving Iraq in 1978, the next time Applicant saw her parents was in 1980 \nwhen her mother visited her in the United States. Both parents came in November 1993 \nand contemplated moving here. However, they returned to Iraq in March 1994, after \ndeciding they were too old to learn a new language and customs. Applicant returned to \nIraq in 2000 to visit her family. That was the last time she physically saw her family. (Tr. \n120).   \n \n \nPrior to going to Iraq for her job, Applicant spoke to her parents about once a \nmonth. After arriving there in July 2005, she generally spoke to her mother once or \ntwice a week.2 She has had very limited conversations with her father or brothers over \nthe years.  While in Iraq, she sent $1500 to one of her brothers because he was out of \nwork. (Tr. 111). Since returning to the United States in December 2007, she telephones \nher mother monthly.  \n \n \nApplicant has a U.S. bank account, but no longer owns property in the United \nStates.  She does not own any property in Iraq. There is no derogatory information \n                                                          \n2 The Department of Defense permits federal contractors to phone friends or relatives in Iraq while \nworking there, provided they do not disclose any vital information. (Tr. 120-121). \n\n \n \n \n \n4\nconcerning her police or financial records. She has never been fired from a job or \narrested. She has never used illegal drugs, or been involved in an alcohol-related \nincident. (GE 1).  \n \n \nThe senior pastor of Applicant\u2019s church testified. He has known her since the fall \nof 2001 and is aware of Applicant\u2019s background and work with the U.S. military in Iraq.  \nThey have had numerous conversations over the years, and he has no doubts about \nher loyalty to the United States.  (Tr. 26-34). \n \n \nOne of Applicant\u2019s friends from church testified. He is a lawyer and active \nmember in various ministries. He has known her for six years. They have maintained \nperiodic communication over those years. Although he did not know what her position \nwas in Iraq, he knew she was required to be careful in communicating with her family, \nresiding there. (Tr. 37-42). \n \n \nA Major with the U.S. Marines, presently stationed in Iraq, testified by telephone. \nHe met Applicant in early February 2006, while serving as an assistant force protection \nofficer. He knows her professionally, as an interpreter, and personally as a member of a \nbible studies group. They worked in a division that screened individuals, many of them \nlocal nationals, seeking admittance to the military base. (Tr. 53).  They interacted three \nto four times a week for about a year. (Tr. 55; 61). He observed that she took her job \nvery seriously and carefully complied with all confidentially requirements. (Tr. 57).  He \nwas aware that Applicant had family living in Iraq, which is common for many Iraqis \nworking on the base and living in Iraq. He was never concerned that Applicant\u2019s family \nrelationships would cause a potential problem for her. (Tr. 58). He knew she had \ntelephone conversations with her mother. (Tr. 65).  He considered her to be in the \u201ctop \n10 percent\u201d of the translators with whom he worked. (Tr. 59). He was grateful to have \nher present and was able to perform his job better because of her skills. (Tr. 60).  He \nthinks \u201cshe\u2019s trustworthy. I mean there\u2019s no doubt in my mind. I would trust her with my \nlife.\u201d (Tr. 67). In an affidavit, he wrote as follows: \n \nShe sacrificed her time and risked her life in support of Operation Iraqi \nFreedom for over two years. Her service has been nothing less than \ncommendable. Without the service of people like [Applicant] our military \nwould not have been able to accomplish the things we have thus far \naccomplished. Her role was priceless. She was a loyal patriot who used \nher language ability to the benefit of the mission and well-being of our \nMarines and Soldiers on the ground in Iraq. She is a true citizen of this \ngreat nation. (DE I). \n \n \n \nApplicant submitted several exhibits attesting to her capabilities and contributions \nto the U.S. Armed Forces\u2019 efforts in the war on terror. On October 2005, she received a \nCertificate of Achievement from the Major of the combat team with whom she was \nworking. The Certificate states that Applicant \u201cperformed her duties with outstanding \nprofessionalism and courage . . . . [Her] cultural knowledge of the Arabic Region \nprovided useful insight about the people and customs of Iraq. Working shoulder to \n\n \n \n \n \n5\nshoulder with soldiers, she often put herself in harms way to accomplish the mission.\u201d \n(DE A at 7).   \n \n \nA team leader for Applicant\u2019s group wrote, \u201cDuring January 2006 through \nNovember 2007, [Applicant] performed her duties in a responsible and thorough \nmanner. Her attention to detail and ability to translate difficult and challenging language \ndifferences was done in a professional manner and was greatly appreciated.\u201d (DE A at \n8). Another interpreter, who worked with Applicant for 22 months, complimented \nApplicant for her hard work and professionalism. (DE D). She was aware of Applicant\u2019s \nimmediate family members living in Iraq and was not concerned about it. She wrote, \n\u201cMany of the Iraqi interpreters working on the base have family in Iraq \u2013 it\u2019s how they \nspeak the language! It is very common and as far as I know has never been an issue.\u201d \n(DE D). \n \n \nApplicant credibly and sincerely asserted her pride of U.S. citizenship at this \nhearing and desire to resume her work with the U.S. Army. Currently, she is \nunemployed because her contract terminated, as a result of her security clearance \nissues. (DE H; Tr. 118). \n \nI take administrative notice of the following facts: In 2003, The United States led \na coalition to remove Saddam Hussein from power in Iraq. After free elections, Iraq\u2019s \nnew government took office. Despite the elections and new government, Iraq remains \nengulfed in violence, perpetrated by Al Qaeda terrorists and other insurgents. \nNumerous attacks and kidnappings have target the U.S. Armed Forces, contractors, \nand other civilians, as well as Iraqis.  Although the new governmental has taken \naggressive action against terrorists, the threat of terrorism in Iraq remains high, as do \nhuman rights abuses. Terrorist groups conduct intelligence activities as effectively as \nstate intelligence services.  \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s over-arching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \n\n \n \n \n \n6\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel....\u201d The \nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n  \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline B, Foreign Influence \n \nAG & 6 expresses the security concern pertaining to foreign influence:  \n \nForeign contacts and interests may be a security concern if the individual \nhas divided loyalties or foreign financial interests, may be manipulated or \ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a \nway that is not in U.S. interest, or is vulnerable to pressure or coercion by \nany foreign interest. Adjudication under this Guideline can and should \nconsider the identity of the foreign county in which the foreign contact or \nfinancial interest is located, including, but not limited to such \nconsiderations as whether the foreign country is known to target United \nStates citizens to obtain protected information and/or is associated with a \nrisk of terrorism. \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 7. Two are potentially applicable in this case: \n\n \n \n \n \n7\n \n(a) contact with a foreign family member, business or professional \nassociate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or resident in a \nforeign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of foreign \nexploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion;3 and \n \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual\u2019s obligation to \nprotect sensitive information or technology and the individual\u2019s desire to \nhelp a foreign person, group, or country by providing that information. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s mother, father and two brothers are citizens and residents of Iraq. \nWhile Iraq struggles with the creation of a democracy, it continues to be routinely \nvictimized by terrorist attacks. This creates a heightened risk of foreign exploitation, \ninducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion. It also creates a potential conflict of \ninterest. AG \u00b6 7(a) and (b) have been raised by the evidence. \n \n \nThe Government produced substantial evidence of those two disqualifying \nconditions, and the burden shifted to Applicant to produce evidence and prove \nmitigation.  Two conditions that could mitigate the disqualifications are provided \nunder AG \u00b6 8:  \n \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of \nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, group, government, or country is \nso minimal, or the individual has such deep and longstanding relationships \nand loyalties in the U.S., that the individual can be expected to resolve any \nconflict of interest in favor of the U.S. interest; and \n \n(c) contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and \ninfrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign \ninfluence or exploitation; \n \nApplicant established the application of AG \u00b6 8(b). Based on her relationship and \ndepth of loyalty to the U.S., she can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in \nfavor of the U.S. interests. At an early age, she expressed an interest in immigrating to \nthe United States and began learning English. In 1978, she moved here with her \nhusband and became a naturalized citizen in 1991. Her son was born in the United \nStates. She worked in the United States since her arrival, until beginning her position \nwith a federal contractor in 2005. She previously owned property and a business here \nwhile married to her former husband. She does not own any property in Iraq, but has a \n                                                          \n3 The mere possession of close family ties with a person in a foreign country is not, as a matter of law, \ndisqualifying under Guideline B. However, if only one relative lives in a foreign country and an applicant \nhas contacts with that relative, this factor alone is sufficient to create the potential for foreign influence \nand could potentially result in the compromise of classified information. See ISCR Case No. 03-02382 at \n5 (App. Bd. Feb. 15, 2006); ISCR Case No. 99-0424 (App. Bd. Feb. 8, 2001). \n \n\n \n \n \n \n8\nU.S. bank account. She established close relationships with members of her church and \nmaintains those connections.  She did not return to Iraq until 2000, when she returned \nfor a family visit.  Her ties to the United States are much stronger than her ties to her \ntwo siblings and elderly parents living in Iraq. \n \nAG \u00b6 8(c) has limited application to Applicant\u2019s relationships with her brothers, \nwith whom she has infrequent communication, albeit she sent one of them some \nmoney. Although there is a remote possibility that terrorists could attempt to coerce or \nthreaten Applicant through her two siblings, it is highly unlikely.   \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \n \n (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which \nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and \nother permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole person concept.        \n \nThe Appeal Board requires the whole person analysis address \u201cevidence of an \napplicant\u2019s personal loyalties; the nature and extent of an applicant\u2019s family\u2019s ties to the \nU.S. relative to his [or her] ties to a foreign country; his or her ties social ties within the \nU.S.; and many others raised by the facts of a given case.\u201d ISCR Case No. 04-00540 at \n7 (App. Bd. Jan. 5, 2007).   \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Four circumstances weigh against \nApplicant in the whole person analysis.  First, there is a significant risk of terrorism and \nhuman rights abuses in Iraq. More importantly for security purposes, terrorists are \nhostile to the United States and actively seek classified information. Terrorists, and even \nfriendly governments, could attempt to use her siblings and parents, who live in Iraq, to \nobtain such information. Second, she had numerous connections to Iraq before she \nimmigrated to the United States in 1991. She was born in Iraq and spent her formative \nyears there. She was educated at an Iraqi university. Third, her parents and two siblings \n\n \n \n \n \n9\nremain citizens and residents of Iraq. Fourth, she maintains some contact with her \nfamily, in particular her mother. \n \n \nSubstantial mitigating evidence weighs in favor of granting Applicant a security \nclearance. Applicant is a mature person. At an early age, she began studying English, in \norder to come to the United States, where she has lived for 30 years and been a \nnaturalized citizen for 17 years. Her son was born here. She owned a business and \nproperty here for over ten years, and presently has a bank account here. Out of her \nsense of love and dedication to the United States, she joined the U.S. Army, as an \nArabic-speaking linguist. She takes her loyalty to the United States very seriously, and \nhas worked diligently for a defense contractor for more than two years in an important \ncapacity for our troops. I give great weight to the major\u2019s testimony, who assesses her \nas loyal and trustworthy, praising her capabilities and significant contributions to the \ncause of freedom in Iraq. Other colleagues confirm that assessment. After leaving Iraq \nin 1978, she did not return for 22 years. Five years after that trip, she returned solely for \nthe purpose of helping the U.S. Army. No witnesses recommended denial of her \nsecurity clearance. There is no evidence she has ever taken any action that could \ncause potential harm to the United States or failed to abide by her employer\u2019s rules and \nregulations. There is not any derogatory information about her in the record.  \n \nApplicant held an interim security clearance during her tenure in Iraq without any \nindication that she breached security policies or procedures. While that fact is not \nnormally to be considered a factor in granting a clearance, the Appeal Board noted in \nISCR Case No. 05-03846 as follows: \n \nAs a general rule, Judges are not required to assign an applicant\u2019s \nprior history of complying with security procedures and regulations \nsignificant probative value for purposes of refuting, mitigating, or \nextenuating the security concerns raised by the applicant\u2019s more \nimmediate disqualifying conduct or circumstances. See, e.g., ISCR Case \nNo. 01-03357 at 4 (App. Bd. Dec. 13, 2005); ISCR Case No. 02-10113 at \n5 (App. Bd. Mar. 25, 2005); ISCR Case No. 03-10955 at 2-3 (App. Bd. \nMay 30, 2006). However, the Board has recognized an exception to that \ngeneral rule in Guideline B cases, where the applicant has established by \ncredible, independent evidence that his compliance with security \nprocedures and regulations occurred in the context of dangerous, high-risk \ncircumstances in which the applicant had made a significant contribution \nto the nation security. See, e.g. ISCR Case No. 04-12363 at 2 (App. Bd. \nJuly 14, 2006). The presence of such circumstances can give credibility to \nan applicant\u2019s assertion that he can be relied upon to recognizes, resist, \nand report a foreign power\u2019s attempts at coercion or exploitation. \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant mitigated the security concerns arising from foreign influence. \n \n\n \n \n \n \n10\nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline B:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.b:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance is denied. \n \nOn December 31, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) \nissued to Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security concerns under \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations. The action was taken under Executive Order \n10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as \namended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel \nSecurity Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the \nrevised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, \n2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September \n1, 2006.  \n \n \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on January 19, 2008, and elected to have \nher case decided on the written record. Department Counsel submitted the \ngovernment\u2019s file of relevant material (FORM) on February 8, 2008. The FORM was \nmailed to Applicant on February 12, 2008, and it was received on February 14, 2008. \n \n1 \n \n \nMay 8, 2008\n\n \n2 \n \n \n                                                          \nApplicant was afforded an opportunity to file objections and submit material in refutation, \nextenuation, or mitigation. Applicant did not object to the FORM and did not submit \nadditional evidence. The case was assigned to me on May 2, 2008.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant admitted all of allegations in the SOR except 1.c. After a thorough and \ncareful review of the pleadings, exhibits, and statements submitted, I make the following \nfindings of fact. \n \n \nApplicant is a 33 years old and has been working for a federal contractor since \nOctober 2005. She served in the Army from 1996 to 2005 and was honorably \ndischarged. She is divorced, remarried, and has three children.  \n \n \nApplicant has accounts that have been delinquent starting in 2001 and continuing \nthrough 2007.1 Her total delinquent debt is approximately $32,000.2 Applicant stated \nthat, in September 2007, she set up a payment plan with Consumer Credit Counseling \nService (CCCS) to begin paying back some of her delinquent debts, and began making \npayments in October 2007. She provided a document that lists certain debts included in \nthe plan and a copy of the contract with only her signature.3 She did not provide any \nproof that she has actually made any payments to the plan or reduced the amount of \nher delinquent debts.  \n \n \nThe following debts are listed on Applicant\u2019s plan with CCCS: 1.b, 1.d, 1.e, 1.f, \n1.g, 1.j, 1.l, and 1.m. Applicant believes the debt listed in 1.a is her ex-husband\u2019s debt \nand that he is paying it. Applicant disputes the debt in 1.c and stated she has had \ndifficulty getting the creditor to provide her with information about the account. Applicant \nstates the debts in 1.h and 1.k are included in her husband\u2019s CCCS account.4 Applicant \nstates she is making payments on the debt in 1.i. Applicant has not provided any \nsupporting documents to corroborate any of her assertions.  \n \n \n1 The debt listed in SOR 1.a was placed for collection in September 1999; 1.b was placed for \ncollection in May 2001; 1.c was placed for collection in 2002; 1.d was placed for collection 2002, 1.e was \ncharged off as a bad debt in June 2002; 1.f was placed for collection in November 2002; 1.g was \ndelinquent for at least 120 days in July 2005; 1.h was charged off as a bad debt in March 2006; 1.i was \nplaced for collection in May 2006; 1.j was placed for collection in June 2006; 1.k was placed for collection \nin June 2006; 1.l was charged off as a bad debt in February 2007; and 1.m was placed for collection in \nMay 2007.  \n \n2 Applicant disputes the debt in 1.c stating it belongs to her ex-husband. It is listed on her credit \nreport, but even giving her the benefit of the doubt, her delinquent debts are approximately $22,000. \n \n3 Item 5.at p. 15.  \n \n4 Apparently Applicant\u2019s husband also has an account with CCCS, but no other amplifying \ninformation was provided, except she lists it on her financial statement showing that he is making \npayments of $350 to the account.  \n\n \n3 \n \n \n                                                          \n \nApplicant\u2019s personal financial statement shows she and her husband earn \napproximately $8,728 a month, and after expenses they have a remainder of $3,858 a \nmonth. She lists she is making a monthly payment of $185 to CCCS and her husband is \nmaking a monthly payment of $350 to his CCCS account. She does not list any other \npayments to creditors.  \n \n \nApplicant provided the following statement with regard to her financial situation: \n\u201cIn the past, I was not able to keep up with financial responsibility because of \n\u2018overdoing\u2019 it. My husband and I, thankfully make enough together to be able to start \nfixing our past problems and mistakes. I have every intention of paying these items that \nare my responsibility and moving forward.\u201d5 No other information was provided. \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in \nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \n \n5 Item 5 at p. 18. \n\n \n4 \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin \nterms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty \nof the applicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple \nprerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG & 18:  \n \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds. \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. I have \nconsidered all of them, especially AG & 19(a) (\u201cinability or unwillingness to satisfy \ndebts\u201d) and (c) (\u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations\u201d). Applicant has delinquent \ndebts dating back as far as 1999 and forward. She has not provided any credible proof \nthat she is making consistent payments towards her debts. I find both disqualifying \nconditions apply. \n \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns arising from financial difficulties. I have considered all of the mitigating \nconditions. I especially considered AG \u00b6 20(a) (\u201cthe behavior happened so long ago, \nwas so infrequent, or occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment\u201d), (b) (\u201cthe conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the individual \nacted responsibly under the circumstances\u201d), (c) (\u201cthe person has received or is \n\n \n5 \n \n \nreceiving counseling for the problem and/or there are clear indications that the problem \nis being resolved or is under control\u201d), and (d) (\u201cthe individual initiated a good-faith effort \nto repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts\u201d).  \n \nApplicant has numerous delinquent debts and has not provided proof that she is \npaying them. Applicant provided a document with a list of debts and a proposed \npayment amount, but failed to prove she has actually been making payments on the \nplan. Her only explanation for her financial situation is that she was \u201coverdoing\u201d it, \npresumably meaning spending beyond her means. She and her husband have more \nthan $3,500 in expendable income each month. Despite this fact, these debts have \nbeen delinquent for years. Even if Applicant provided proof she is paying $185 a month \nto the creditors listed in the plan, she only recently started the plan. In addition, it does \nnot rise to the level of making a good-faith effort to repay her creditors, because it will \ntake years to repay them, and it does not include all of her creditors. With regard to \ndelinquent debts she claimed are being paid by her ex-husband, she failed to provide \ndocuments to substantiate her assertion. Even though Applicant contacted CCCS in \nSeptember 2007 to address her delinquent debts, this does not negate the years of \nneglecting her obligation to responsibly pay her bills. Therefore, I find mitigating \nconditions (a), (b), and (d) do not apply. There is evidence Applicant has a proposed \nplan with CCCS, but no evidence she has received any type of financial counseling. \nHence, I find mitigating condition (c) only partially applies. \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which \nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and \nother permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant has a long history of not \nfulfilling her financial obligations. Only recently did she contact CCCS for assistance. \nShe and her husband have considerable expendable income, yet even if she \n\n \n6 \n \n \nsubstantiated her payments, they are minimal at best. I am unable to conclude \nApplicant has successfully mitigated the security concerns raised. Overall the record \nevidence leaves me with serious questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and \nsuitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant failed to \nmitigate the security concerns arising from financial considerations.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.m: \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nCarol G.

The action\nwas taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within\nIndustry (February 20, 1960), as amended, and Department of Defense Directive\n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2,\n1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised Adjudicative Guidelines (AG)\npromulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective within the\nDepartment of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \nOn June 20, 2008, Applicant signed a notarized document in which she admitted\nall allegations. This occurred one day following her request that a determination be\nmade without a hearing. On August 8, 2008, Department Counsel submitted its File of\nRelevant Material (FORM).

Academically, she has earned both a bachelor\u2019s and a\nmaster\u2019s degree. After a first marriage that lasted from 1992 through 1998, Applicant\nremarried in December 1999.

She understood the\nagreement was unenforceable when he stopped making the payments by June 2006.\nApplicant felt betrayed. She was also convinced he was monitoring her bank accounts\nand income. In her anger, she went on-line, opened a credit card account in his name,\nand paid off one of her own credit cards. In the application process, Applicant gave her\nown home address and email address.\nApplicant\u2019s husband eventually became aware that a fraudulent use of his\nidentity had taken place. He reported his suspicion to the credit card company, then\nmade a report to the local sheriff\u2019s department on October 10, 2006. The subsequent\ninvestigation revealed that Applicant had used her own addresses in opening the\naccount. Advised of the investigation\u2019s results, Applicant\u2019s ex-husband chose to press\ncharges for the identity theft and theft. Applicant was ultimately arrested for the crimes\non January 16, 2007. In March 2007, Applicant agreed to plead guilty to\nmisrepresentation of another person\u2019s identity and theft of $4,500.  As a result,\n1\njudgement was deferred on the condition she complete a diversion program with ten\nhours of community service per month, appointments with a diversion specialist,\nattendance in group decision making sessions for 18 to 36 sessions, and make\nrestitution of $4,500 to the bank.  She began the program on or about April 2007. Upon\n2\ncompletion of her program, the matter is to be removed from her permanent record.\nAt no time between her arrest and her plea did Applicant inform the government,\nher employer, or her security officer of her situation. She first mentioned the incident\nduring a security clearance investigation in June 2007. In stating that she thought that\nher admission to those investigators, who apparently already knew the facts,\nconstituted her official notification, Applicant remarked: \u201cI have never attempted to\n\n SOR Response, dated June 20, 2008.\n    3\n FORM Response, dated September 15, 2008.\n    4\n Id.\n    5\n3\nwithhold information regarding my security clearance.\u201d  The incident was subsequently\n3\nnoted on Applicant\u2019s February 2008 up-date to her e-QIP.\nApplicant notes that she attended and completed 18 Adult Decision Making and\nResponsibility Sessions, but has not produced any documentary evidence supporting\nthis assertion. She states she has learned how to manage her anger. She recognizes\nshe was weak and felt betrayed by her ex-husband. She alleges that she has made\nrestitution and completed all requirements of her diversion program, although she failed\nto offer any corroborative documentation. She writes: \u201cIt is expected that I will complete\nthat program in October 2008.\u201d  Applicant is contrite and feels genuine remorse; she\n4\nfeels she is fully rehabilitated and notes that she has not committed any other crimes.5\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG).

The ultimate burden of persuasion is on the applicant.  \n7\n8\nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration\nof the possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \u201cThe clearly consistent standard\nindicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of\ndenials.\u201d  Any reasonable doubt about whether an applicant should be allowed access\n9\nto sensitive information must be resolved in favor of protecting such sensitive\ninformation. The decision to deny an individual a security clearance is not necessarily a\ndetermination as to the loyalty of an applicant.  It is merely an indication that the\n10\napplicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense\nhave established for issuing a clearance.\nAnalysis\nBased upon consideration of the evidence, I find Guideline J (Criminal Conduct)\nand Guideline E (Personal Conduct) to be the most pertinent to the case.\nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct\nCriminal activity creates doubt about a person\u2019s judgment, reliability, and\ntrustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person\u2019s ability or willingness\nto comply with laws, rules, and regulations. With respect to Guideline J (Criminal\nConduct), the Government has established its case. Applicant admits she fraudulently\nobtained a credit card in her ex-husband\u2019s name and used it to pay her own debts.\nCriminal Conduct Disqualifying Conditions (CC DC) AG \u00b6 31(a) (\u201ca single serious crime\n\n5\nor multiple lesser offenses\u201d), and CC DC AG \u00b6 31(c) (\u201callegation or admission of\ncriminal conduct, regardless of whether the person was formally charged, formally\nprosecuted, or convicted\u201d) apply.\nThe crime at issue occurred only two years ago and Applicant has yet to\ncomplete her diversion program. While the circumstances were unique, they were not\nunforeseeable. Applicant knew her agreement for alimony was informally made outside\nof the divorce decree and unenforceable. Yet she still felt betrayed and sought revenge\nwhen he reneged on the scheme. As a result, she committed fraud. She may never\nagain find herself in a similar situation. Her knee-jerk reflex or reckless pursuit to seek\nrevenge, however, affects current consideration of her present judgment. Similarly, the\nactual fraud she perpetrated calls into question her recent reliability and\ntrustworthiness. Consequently, Criminal Conduct Mitigating Condition (CC MC) AG \u00b6\n32(a) (\u201cso much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it happened\nunder such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on\nthe individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment\u201d) does not apply.\nApplicant admits she committed the crime at issue. She also admits she pled to\nthe charges. Consequently, CC MC AG \u00b6 32(b) (\u201cthe person was pressured or coerced\ninto committing the act and those pressures are no longer present in the person\u2019s life\u201d)\nand AG \u00b6 32(c) (\u201cevidence the person did not commit the act\u201d) do not apply.\nToday, Applicant feels she is rehabilitated. She points to her completion of 18\nAdult Decision Making and Responsibility Sessions and the sense she has regained her\nability to deal with anger. She also points to her completion of all diversion program\nrequirements, including restitution, and states she expects to be released from the\nprogram in October 2008. The fact that Applicant feels she has been rehabilitated is\nimportant; her contrition is apparent. She failed, however, to introduce any corroborative\ndocumentation establishing that she has completed this minimum number of sessions\nrequired by her diversion program. She similarly declined to submit any certifications,\nevaluations, or other paperwork supporting her contention that she has completed all\ndiversion program requirements or that she has been evaluated as rehabilitated. Most\nimportantly, she is still a participant in her diversion program. Given these\nconsiderations, CC MC AG \u00b6 32(d) (\u201cthere is evidence of successful rehabilitation,\nincluding but not limited to the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity,\nremorse or restitution, job training or higher education, good employment record, or\nconstructive community involvement\u201d) does not apply. In sum, Applicant is still a\nparticipant in a diversion program after committing a fraudulent act. She failed to\nproduce any documentation as to her diversion program progress and has not yet had\ntime to demonstrate post-program rehabilitation. Therefore, Applicant has failed to\nmitigate criminal conduct security concerns.\nGuideline E \u2013 Personal Conduct\nSecurity concerns arising from matters of personal conduct are controlled by\nGuideline E, \u00b6 15 of the AG. Such security concerns arise in the presence of\nquestionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, dishonesty, or\n\n6\nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations which could indicate that the person\nmay not properly safeguard classified information.\nIn January 2007, Applicant was arrested for her crime. She accepted a guilty\nplea in March 2007 and entered into a diversion program in April 2007. It was not until\nshe was interviewed by investigators in June 2007 that she disclosed her arrest, plea,\nand subsequent diversion program to the government or her employer. Such facts give\nrise to Personal Conduct Disqualifying Condition AG \u00b6 16(e) (\u201cpersonal conduct, or\nconcealment of information about one\u2019s conduct, that creates a vulnerability to\nexploitation, manipulation, or duress, such as (1) engaging in activities which, if known,\nmay affect the person\u2019s personal, professional, or community standing. . . . \u201c). \nArrested in January 2007, Applicant did not inform her security officer, employer,\nor the government of her predicament. Nor did she contemporaneously disclose her\nsubsequent plea in March 2007 or her entry into a diversion program in April 2007.\nInstead, such information was withheld until she met with investigators in June 2007.\nPersonal Conduct Mitigating Condition (PC MC) AG \u00b6 17(a) (\u201cthe individual made\nprompt, good faith efforts to correct the omission, concealment, or falsification before\nbeing confronted with the facts\u201d) does not apply. \nMoreover, although Applicant\u2019s concealment of her arrest and plea occurred over\na year ago, such concealment directly undermines that level of reliability, judgment, and\ncandor expected of one possessing a security clearance. Consequently, it raises issues\nof concern that cannot be erased simply by the passage of one year and the\nexpectation one might soon be released from a diversion program. Personal Conduct\nMitigating Condition (PC MC) \u00b6 17(c) (\u201cthe offense is so minor, or so much time has\npassed, or the behavior is so infrequent, or it happened under such unique\ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s\nreliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment\u201d) does not apply. Further, inasmuch as\nApplicant failed to offer little more than words of contrition and uncorroborated\ntestimony that she is soon to be released from her diversion program, an assessment\nunder PC MC AG \u00b6 17(e) (\u201cthe individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate\nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress\u201d) cannot be explored. Taken\ntogether, Applicant failed to carry her burden in mitigating personal conduct security\nconcerns.\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the\nApplicant\u2019s conduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should\nconsider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature,\nextent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct,\nto include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct;\n(4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which\nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other\npermanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for\n\n7\npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or\nrecurrence.\u201d Under AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility\nfor a public trust position must be an overall common sense judgment based upon\ncareful consideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of the\nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case, as well as the \u201cwhole person\u201d factors.\nApplicant is a mature woman with years of work experience and a master\u2019s degree.\nFeeling betrayed by her ex-husband, she sought revenge. She stealthily and illegally\nobtained a credit card in his name, although she carelessly used her home and email\naddress in the process. The passions that enraged her are not unique, given the\nemotions often accompanying divorce. Her revenge, however, was puerile and\namateurishly executed. It demonstrated rash judgment, not the sound judgment\nexpected of one seeking to be entrusted with classified information. Similarly, her failure\nto timely report her arrest and her plea to the government or to her employer\ndemonstrated poor reliability and trustworthiness. While Applicant may feel she is\nrehabilitated, she failed to document her progress within her diversion program, which\nshe has yet to complete. Upon release from her diversion program, Applicant may\nbetter demonstrate genuine rehabilitation. At present, however, security concerns\nremain with regard to her criminal conduct and personal conduct. Clearance is denied.\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline J:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline E:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with national security to continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security\nclearance. Clearance is denied.\nARTHUR E. MARSHALL, JR.\nAdministrative Judge\n",

However, viewed in light of the Judge\u2019s sustainable findings concerning\nthe nature and extent of Applicant\u2019s foreign relatives and associates, and in light of the record as a\nwhole, the Board concludes that any factual errors in the decision are harmless.

On April 25, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings \nand Appeals (DOHA) issued Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security \nconcerns under Guideline B, Foreign Influence.

His answer was received by DOHA on May 22, 2008.  On June 12, 2008, \nApplicant\u2019s case file was forwarded to Department Counsel Jaksetic, along with a cover \nmemorandum. After reviewing the case, Department Counsel concluded that a hearing \nin the matter of Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance would be advisable. \nPursuant to DoD Directive 5220.6, Additional Procedural Guidance, \u00b6 E3.1.7, \nDepartment Counsel requested a hearing in the case.  DOHA\u2019s Administrative Division \ndesignated the case for hearing, and the case was processed accordingly. \n \nThe case was assigned to me on September 3, 2008.  I convened a hearing on \nOctober 22, 2008, to consider whether it is clearly consistent with the national interest to \ngrant or continue a security clearance for Applicant. The Government called no \nwitnesses, introduced three exhibits (Ex. 1, 2, and 3), and offered facts found in eight \nofficial documents of the U.S. Government for administrative notice. (Hearing Exhibit \n(HE) I.)  The Government\u2019s exhibits were admitted without objection.  I took \nadministrative notice of HE 1.  Applicant testified on this own behalf and called three \nwitnesses. At the hearing, he introduced three exhibits, which were identified as Ex. A, \nB, and C and admitted without objection.  DOHA received the transcript (TR) of the \nhearing on October 30, 2008. \n                                                    \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nThe SOR contains nine allegations of disqualifying conduct under AG B, Foreign \nInfluence (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a. through 1.i.). In his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted all \nnine allegations and provided additional information. Applicant\u2019s admissions are \nadmitted as findings of fact.   \n \n \nAfter a thorough review of the record in the case, including witness testimony, \nexhibits, relevant policies, and the applicable adjudicative guideline, I make the \nfollowing findings of fact:  \n \n \nApplicant is 50 years old and employed as a senior associate by a government \ncontractor. Applicant was born in the United States and received a Bachelor of Science \ndegree in physics from a U.S. university. He studied in a non-degree master\u2019s program \nin international security. He has worked as a government contractor with special \nemphasis on propulsion science.  He has also specialized in nuclear weapons safety \nand cooperative security. As a government contractor, he has carried out threat \nreduction projects in Russia and other locations in the former Soviet Union.  He was first \ngranted a security clearance in about 1983 or 1984.  (Ex. 1; Ex. A; Tr. 33-38.) \n \n\n \n3 \n \n \n \nApplicant was married to a U.S. citizen in 1985.  He and his wife divorced in \nabout January of 1989.  (Ex. 1 at 19-20.)    \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s work in arms control has brought him in contact with foreign nationals \nfrom Russia, Romania, Israel, Iraq, and Pakistan.  Some of Applicant\u2019s professional   \ncontacts have also resulted in personal relationships. With regard to his relationships  \nwith foreign nationals working in weapons and arms control, Applicant stated:  \n \nI think, first and foremost, the assumption is when you travel, especially to \na place like Russia or any foreign country, when you\u2019re dealing with \nmembers of either the military or even their industrial complex that [do]  \n. . .work. . . with weapons, you automatically assume that they either work \nfor their country\u2019s intelligence bureaus, report to them in some way, \nwhether informally or formally, or could be subjected to some kind of \npressure to gain information from some of their contacts or counterparts.  \n(Tr. 50-51.) \n \n \nApplicant explained that he and his U.S. colleagues who worked with classified \ninformation in international settings had a code of conduct in which \u201cyou just don\u2019t make \ninquiries into details of what [colleagues] do because you never want to put someone in \na position where they could make a mistake and . . . give you information you have no \nneed to know. . . . So you behave in such a way where you are very guarded about any \ndetails with your work.\u201d  (Tr. 52.) \n \n \nApplicant also stated that \u201c[i]f you have more than a casual contact with a foreign \nnational, \nyou \nare \nto \nreport \nit \nto \nSecurity \nServices \nor \nthe \nSecurity  \nDepartment.\u201d (Tr. 104-105.)  \n \n \nWhen he completed an e-QIP in January 2006, Applicant acknowledged \nfriendships with a number of foreign nationals and indicated that he could supply more \ninformation about these relationships if necessary.  He was interviewed by an \nauthorized investigator from the U.S. Office of Personnel Management (OPM) on \nDecember 18, 2006, and he provided information about travel and relationships with \nforeign nationals. In response to DOHA interrogatories in August 2007, Applicant \nprovided some corrections to the report of the OPM investigator. In February 2008, \nApplicant provided information about several foreign associates with whom he has had \npast business contacts that resulted in personal friendships.  (Ex. 1; Ex. 2; Ex. 3.) \n \n \nApplicant reported past professional dealings and personal friendships with two \nRussian citizens. One of the Russian citizens resides in Russia; the other resides in the \nUnited States. The Russian resident and citizen served in the Russian military.  \nApplicant assumed this individual also served in a Russian intelligence unit. At one time, \nthe Russian had a work relationship with Applicant and reported to him, but he has not \nhad such a work relationship with Applicant for about three years. In response to \ninterrogatories, Applicant identified the individual as \u201cfriend, colleague, former \n\n \n4 \n \n \nemployee.\u201d He reported weekly to monthly e-mail and telephone exchanges with this \nindividual.  (SOR \u00b6 1.d; Ex. 3; Tr. 183.) \n \n \nThe other Russian citizen has served in a unit of the Russian government and is \ncurrently working in the United States for an international organization.  Applicant \nidentified this individual as \u201cformer colleague; professional friendship.\u201d He stated he has \nhad monthly e-mail contact with this person since 2002.  (SOR \u00b6 1.f; Ex. 3.) \n \n \nApplicant also reported a professional relationship and personal friendship with a \ncitizen of Romania, who is retired from the Romanian military and who resides in the \nUnited States.  Applicant reported weekly e-mail contact with this individual since 2003. \n(SOR \u00b6 1.e; Ex. 3.) \n \n \nApplicant has not informed his current employer of his contacts with the two \nRussians and of his Russian friend\u2019s possible connection to Russian intelligence.  He \nhas not reported his on-going contacts with the former Romanian military officer to his \ncurrent employer.  (Ex. 2; Ex. 3; Tr. 54-58, 88-94, 107-108.) \n \n \nApplicant has a professional associate and friend who is a citizen and resident of \nIsrael. The individual has worked for the Israeli government and is now retired. \nApplicant identified this person as \u201ccolleague, friend.\u201d  He has had monthly e-mail \ncontact with this individual since 1990, and he considers the relationship as \u201cprimarily \nsocial.\u201d (SOR \u00b6 1.g; Ex. 3; Tr. 95.)  \n \n \nApplicant also has a professional and social relationship with a retired military \nofficer who is a citizen and resident of Pakistan and related to a political leader in \nPakistan.  Applicant reported monthly e-mail exchanges with this individual, who has \nalso visited Applicant\u2019s home for dinner.  (SOR \u00b6 1.i; Ex. 3; Tr. 61-63, 103-104.)   \n \n \nAdditionally, Applicant had a friendship with a citizen and resident of Iraq who \nwas employed by the Iraqi government. He exchanged e-mails with her approximately \nfive to eight times a year. He stopped communicating with her when he began to feel \nuneasy about the tone of her messages and her attitudes about the Iraq war. He did not \ninform his security officer of his suspicions about the Iraqi or the fact that he had broken \noff e-mail contact with her. (SOR \u00b6 1.h; Ex. 3; Tr. 60-61, 98-101, 109.) \n \n \nOne of Applicant\u2019s professional associations with a citizen and resident of \nRussia, described in SOR \u00b6 1. d, merits more discussion. In about 1995 or 1996, \nApplicant met and had a professional relationship with the Russian, hereinafter referred \nto as \u201cA,\u201d who was formerly assigned to a Russian army intelligence unit. \u201cA\u201d served as \na translator and logistics organizer for a project Applicant was working on in Russia.  \nApplicant and \u201cA\u201d came to know one another well and to have a social as well as a \nprofessional relationship.  When Applicant first met \u201cA,\u201d he reported the contact to his \nsecurity office.  (Tr. 53-55, 82-83, 105.) \n \n\n \n5 \n \n \n \n\u201cA\u201d resided in Moscow, but traveled to the United States on occasion in recent \nyears to take part in defense-related training or to act as a consultant to government \ncontractors.  At present he works as an independent consultant to a U.S. government \ncontractor. Applicant last met \u201cA\u201d for dinner about six months ago when he was in the \nUnited States.  (Tr. 83-84.)   \n \n \nIn 1999, \u201cA\u201d was responsible in part for recruiting translators and logistics \nplanning for a public hearing that Applicant and other U.S. contractors attended in \nRussia. One of the translators hired was a 23-year-old woman, hereinafter referred to \nas \u201cB,\u201d who was a recent English literature and language graduate of a Russian \nuniversity. For about two years, from 1999 to 2001, \u201cA\u201d was \u201cB\u2019s\u201d supervisor. (Tr. 134, \n144-146.)  \n \n \nApplicant and \u201cB\u201d became acquainted at the meeting.  As time went on, their \nrelationship became romantic. Applicant reported his relationship with \u201cB\u201d to his \nemployer\u2019s security officer when he first met her, and he also reported to his security \noffice when he and \u201cB\u201d began to date. In 2001, Applicant was in Moscow on \nassignment. \u201cB,\u201d who at the time lived elsewhere in Russia, came to Moscow and was \nassigned to work as a contractor on the same project that Applicant was working on. In \nabout March of 2001, Applicant and \u201cB\u201d began to live together. Via courier, Applicant \nsent a message informing his program manager in the United States that he and \u201cB\u201d \nwere cohabiting. He asked his program manager to report his cohabitation to the \ncompany security manager. At his hearing, Applicant did not know if the program \nmanager had passed the information to the security officer, although his relationship \nwith \u201cB\u201d was known to many of his coworkers and foreign colleagues.  (Tr. 144-146, \n167-170, 185-188.) \n \n  \nIn 2003, Applicant took a job with an international organization in the United \nStates.  \u201cB\u201d joined him in February 2003.  They were married in October 2003.  (Ex. 1; \nTr. 124-125, 146, 172.) \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s wife, \u201cB,\u201d is a citizen of Russia and resides with him in the United \nStates.  Applicant\u2019s father-in-law and mother-in-law are residents and citizens of Russia.  \nApplicant\u2019s mother-in-law is a retired teacher. Applicant\u2019s father-in-law, who retired in \n2001, was employed by a Russian government law enforcement organization. In his \nretirement, the father-in- law has held positions as a security consultant.  (Tr. 129, 149-\n51, 171.) \n \n \nWhen she was growing up in the former Soviet Union, \u201cB\u201d was told by her \nparents that her father was employed as an engineer. When she was about twelve \nyears old, her classmates teased her about her father\u2019s work and said he was an agent \nof a Russian government law enforcement organization.  \u201cB\u201d confronted her father and \nasked him if the story about him was true. He replied that it was, but he cautioned her \nnot to disclose his true occupation.  (Tr. 129-131, 150-153.) \n \n\n \n6 \n \n \n \nApplicant never asked \u201cB\u201d about her father\u2019s occupation or employment.  He only \nlearned of his father-in-law\u2019s pre-retirement occupation when he prepared for his \nsecurity clearance hearing.  (Tr. 75-77.)   \n \n \n\u201cB\u201d is close to her parents. She speaks on the telephone with her mother several \ntimes a week. In her current employment, she travels to Russia on business about twice \na year, and she tries to visit her parents when she is in Russia on these business trips.  \nSince 2003, when she first came to the United States, \u201cB\u201d has visited her parents in \nRussia five times.  (Tr. 127-129, 157.) \n \n \n \n\u201cB\u201d has an older half-sister, with whom she is also close. She communicates with \nher sister by telephone. The sister has two sons, ages 19 and 20. \u201cB\u201d sometimes sends \ngifts to her nephews.  (Tr. 147-148, 172-174, 159-160.) \n \n \n\u201cB\u201d has met several of Applicant\u2019s foreign friends. When Applicant\u2019s Russian \nfriend \u201cA\u201d, who employed \u201cB,\u201d was in the United States six months ago, Applicant and \n\u201cB\u201d met him for dinner. \u201cA\u201d has also, on occasion, been a dinner guest at Applicant\u2019s \nhome. \u201cB\u201d has met Applicant\u2019s Romanian friend several times.  She has met her \nhusband\u2019s other Russian contact once or twice.  She has also met the Pakistani \ncontact.  She has not met her husband\u2019s Israeli or the Iraqi contacts. (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.d, \n1.e, 1.f, 1.g, 1.h, 1.i; Tr. 83-84; 134-136, 198.) \n \n \nTwo of Applicant\u2019s witnesses were individuals who were friends and who had \nalso been colleagues of his. One witness, who held a security clearance, stated his \nunderstanding that individuals who hold security clearances have an obligation to report \nforeign contacts that are not work related.  He noted that to comply with this \nrequirement, he reported to his security officer his social contact with Applicant\u2019s wife \n\u201cB.\u201d  (Tr. 223-224, 233.)  \n \n \nI take administrative notice of the following facts about Russia which appear in \nofficial U.S. government publications: \n \n \nThe United States and Russia share certain common strategic interests. Of \nmutual interest to the United States and Russia are counterterrorism and the reduction \nof strategic arsenals.  Russia and the United States share a common interest in \ncontrolling the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and the means to deliver \nthem.  The Cooperative Threat Reduction (CRT) program was launched in 1992 to \nprovide for the dismantlement of weapons of mass destruction in the former Soviet \nUnion. The CRT program was renewed in 2006 for seven years, until 2013. (HR1: \nBackground Note: Russia, Bureau of European and Eurasian Affairs, U.S. Department \nof State, July 2008, at 10.) \n \n \nSince at least 1997, Russia has targeted U.S. technologies and has sought to \nobtain protected information through industrial espionage. Russia\u2019s Directorate of the \nGeneral Staff (GRU) provides intelligence to Russia\u2019s military. The GRU carries out \nspecialized technical collection activities that threaten U.S. interests.  Additionally, a \n\n \n7 \n \n \nKGB-successor organization, the Federal Security Service (FSB), operates outside \nRussia by targeting national security and environmental researchers.  Russia also \noperates a signal intelligence facility in Cuba that targets the United States.  (HE 1: \nSummary at 1-3.)  \n \n \nIn addition to its technology collection and espionage activities against the U.S., \nRussia supports missile programs and nuclear and biotechnology projects in other \ncountries. These technologies can be used in the construction of weapons of mass \ndestruction.  Despite U.S. concerns, Russia has refused to cease constructing nuclear \nreactors in Iran. (HE 1: Summary at 3-4.) \n \n \nRussia\u2019s internal problems include terrorism and a poor human rights record.  \nThe U.S. Department of State has warned U.S. citizens of safety concerns related to \ntravel in Russia.  (HE 1: Summary at 4.) \n \n \nThe U.S. Department of State reports allegations that Russian government \nofficials and others conduct electronic surveillance without judicial permission.  This \nsurveillance includes FSB monitoring of internet and e-mail traffic.  Additionally, Russian \nlaw enforcement agencies have legal access to the personal information of users of \ntelephone and cell phone services.  (HE 1: Summary at 6-7.) \n \n \nNeither party provided facts for administrative notice regarding the U.S. \ngovernment\u2019s relationships with governments of Romania, Pakistan, Israel, and Iraq.        \n    \n  \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the  \nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, the administrative judge applies these guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \nover-arching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. \nAccording to AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of \nvariables known as the \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \n\n \n8 \n \n \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \n \nUnder Guideline B, Foreign Influence, \u201c[f]oreign contacts and interests may be a \nsecurity concern if the individual has divided loyalties or foreign financial interests, may \nbe manipulated or induced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government \nin a way that is not in U.S. interests, or is vulnerable to pressure or coercion by any \nforeign interest.\u201d  AG \u00b66. \n \n \nAdditionally, adjudications under Guideline B \u201ccan and should consider the \nidentity of the foreign country in which the foreign contact or financial interest is located, \nincluding, but not limited to, such considerations as whether the foreign country is \nknown to target U.S. citizens to obtain protected information and/or is associated with \nthe risk of terrorism.\u201d  AG \u00b66. \n \n \nA Guideline B decision concerning Russia must take into consideration the \ngeopolitical situation in Russia, as well and the dangers existing in Russia.  Russia is a \ndiplomatic and strategic partner of the United States in some areas where both \ncountries have mutual interests.  For example, Russia is a key partner in efforts to \nreduce proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and control of nuclear materials.   \nRussia is also one of the most aggressive nations in the collection of U.S. intelligence \nand sensitive economic information. \n\n \n9 \n \n \n                                           \n \n \nI have considered all of the disqualifying conditions under the Foreign Influence \nguideline.  The facts of Applicant\u2019s case raise security concerns under disqualifying \nconditions AG \u00b6 7(a) and AG \u00b67(d).1  \n \n \nThe United States is a primary intelligence target of Russia. American citizens \nwith immediate family members who are citizens or residents of Russia could be \nvulnerable to coercion, exploitation, or pressure. \n \n \nApplicant has personal friendships with two citizens of Russia who have held \npositions in the government of Russia. Applicant\u2019s wife is a citizen of Russia.  His father-\nin-law and mother-in-law are citizens and residents of Russia. Applicant\u2019s father-in-law \nwas employed by a Russian law enforcement agency, and, in his retirement, he works \nas a security consultant. Applicant shares his home with his wife, who has close familial \nrelationships with her parents. Applicant\u2019s wife speaks with her parents on the \ntelephone frequently. She has traveled to Russia to visit her parents five times since \ncoming to the United States in 2003. These facts raise a security concerns under AG \u00b6\u00b6 \n7(a) and 7(d). \n \n \nSeveral mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 8 might be applicable to Applicant\u2019s \ncase.  If \u201cthe nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in which these \npersons are located, or the positions or activities of those persons in that country are \nsuch that it is unlikely the individual will be placed in a position of having to choose \nbetween the interests of a foreign individual, group, organization, or government and the \ninterests of the U.S.,\u201d then AG \u00b6 8(a) might apply.  If \u201cthere is no conflict of interest, \neither because the individual\u2019s sense of loyalty or obligation to the foreign person, \ngroup, government, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such deep and \nlongstanding relationships and loyalties in the U.S., that the individual can be expected \nto resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the U.S. interest,\u201d then AG \u00b6 8(b) might \napply.  If \u201ccontact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and infrequent that \nthere is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign influence or exploitation,\u201d \nthen AG \u00b6 8(c) might apply.  If \u201cthe foreign contacts and activities are on U.S. \nGovernment business or are approved by the cognizant security authority,\u201d then AG \u00b6 \n8(d) might apply. \n \n \nAlthough Applicant met his two Russian friends while on official government \nbusiness, his current relationship with them is not work-related but social and based on \nfriendship. He has not informed his current employer of these on-going contacts or his \nsuspicion that one of his Russian contacts may have involvement with Russian \nintelligence. \n \n \n1 AG \u00b6 7(a) reads: \u201ccontact with a foreign family member, business or professional associate, friend, or \nother person who is a citizen of or resident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of \nforeign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion.\u201d  AG \u00b6 7(d) reads: \u201csharing living \nquarters with a person or persons, regardless of citizenship status, if that relationship creates a \nheightened risk of foreign inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion.\u201d \n\n \n10 \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s relationships with his wife, and his wife\u2019s relationships with her \nparents, are neither casual nor infrequent. Instead, these relationships are based on \nlong-standing family ties of affection and obligation. Applicant is a devoted husband, \nand his wife, a citizen of Russia, is a dutiful daughter to her parents, who are citizens \nand residents of Russia. These close relationships raise a heightened risk that Applicant \ncould be targeted for exploitation, pressure, or coercion by the government of Russia in \nways that might also threaten U.S. security interests.  \n \nApplicant offered no evidence to rebut the Government\u2019s assertion that his \ncontacts with two friends, who are citizens of Russia, as well as his wife, a citizen of \nRussia, and his in-laws, who are citizens and residents of Russia, created a heightened \nrisk of foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion. Applicant\u2019s \nrelationships with his friends and family members who are citizens of Russia could force \nhim to choose between loyalty to his relatives and the security interests of the United \nStates.  (ISCR Case No. 03-15485 at 4-6 (App. Bd. June 2, 2005)   I conclude that none \nof the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6\u00b6 8(a), 8(b), 8(c), or 8(d) apply to the facts of \nApplicant\u2019s case. \n \n \nNothing in Applicant\u2019s answers to the Guideline B allegations in the SOR \nsuggested he was not a loyal U.S. citizen. Section 7 of Executive Order 10865 \nspecifically provides that industrial security clearance decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d   \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which \nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and \nother permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of the \nwhole person concept and all the facts and circumstances surrounding this case. \n\n \n11 \n \n \n \nApplicant is a native-born U.S. citizen and a mature adult of 50 years of age. He \nhas broad experience as a government contractor and international civil servant. His \nexpertise is in propulsion science and nuclear weapons safety, and he enjoys the \nrespect of his professional associates who are also government contractors.  \n \nAdditionally, Applicant has several business and professional associations with \nforeign citizens who have worked in the military services or military intelligence units of \ntheir respective countries. While these contacts were necessary when Applicant was on \nofficial U.S. business, they could raise security concerns now that Applicant no longer \nsees them on official business and does not report on-going social contacts with these \nindividuals to his security officials. Of particular note, because of Applicant\u2019s existing \ncontacts with family members who are citizens and residents of Russia, are his on-\ngoing social contacts with the former Russian military official and former Russian \ngovernment official identified at SOR \u00b6 1.d and 1.f. \n \nRussia and the United States cooperate in certain strategic areas of mutual \ninterest, such as the reduction of nuclear proliferation and the war on terrorism. At the \nsame time, Russia aggressively targets U.S. national security researchers and U.S. \nindustries to obtain protected information. Russia\u2019s targeting activities threaten U.S. \nsecurity interests. \n \nWhile assigned to work in Russia as a government contractor, Applicant became \nromantically involved with a Russian woman eighteen years his junior. He did not make \ninquiry about her family background or associations before becoming romantically \ninvolved with her. Had he done so, he might have learned that her father was employed \nby a Russian government law enforcement agency, a fact that may have raised security \nconcerns and increased his vulnerability to the possibility of coercion or duress.  \n \nApplicant also should have been aware that \u201cB\u201d was hired and supervised by \u201cA,\u201d \na citizen and resident of Russia and a person Applicant knew had a likely background in \nRussian military intelligence. Applicant cohabited with \u201cB\u201d in Moscow for several months \nwhen he was assigned to put U.S. security interests before his personal interests. His \nactions did not comport with the code of conduct he claimed he carried out as one \nentrusted with classified information by the U.S. government. Additionally, he did not \nkeep his security officers apprised of his developing relationship with \u201cB\u201d so that they \ncould have determined whether it was in the government\u2019s and the company\u2019s interest \nfor him to remain on duty in Russia. \n \n  Applicant did not show good judgment in the choices he made. His conduct had \nthe potential to seriously compromise the work he was assigned to carry out on behalf \nof the United States. He put relationships with Russian foreign nationals before U.S. \nsecurity interests.  \n \nApplicant also had professional relationships and friendships with Romanian, \nIsraeli, Iraqi, and Pakistani foreign nationals.  The record reflected that he failed to keep \nhis cognizant security officials aware of some of his on-going social contacts with these \n\n \n12 \n \n \n                                           \nindividuals, after he was no longer assigned to work with them on official U.S. \nbusiness.2 However, the record contains insufficient factual information for me to \nconclude that Applicant\u2019s contacts with citizens and residents of Romania, Iraq, \nPakistan, and Israel raised Guideline B security concerns.  There is no evidence in the \nrecord concerning the diplomatic, economic, military, or international relationship of the \nUnited States with these countries. \n \n Overall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant failed to mitigate the security concerns arising under AG  B.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the \namended SOR, as required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline B:  \n \nAGAINST  APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.b:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.c:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.d:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.e:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.f:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.g:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.h:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.i:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n2 The SOR does not allege Applicant failed to report his foreign contacts. \n\n \n13 \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant\u2019s admissions to the SOR allegations are incorporated herein. In addition, after a thorough review of the pleadings, testimony and exhibits, I make the following findings of fact: Applicant is 49 years old. She has been employed as a patient care advocate by a defense contractor since June 2006. She was continuously employed outside the defense industry as a team leader from August 1992 until August 2000, and by a second company that assumed the contract she was working under from August 2000 to August 2004. Although she listed continuous employment with four different employers from the time she was given a severance from her longtime employer in August 2004 until the present, she testified she was unemployed for a short period of time in or about May 2006 (Tr. pp. 39- 40). Applicant has been married since July 1996. She has an 11-year-old daughter. Applicant\u2019s husband has been continuously employed by the same employer during their marriage. Applicant and her husband filed a Chapter 7 bankruptcy petition in July 2002. The petition lists seven creditors owed $40,500 in unsecured nonpriority claims. Six of those creditors, totaling $33,500, appear to be credit cards and the seventh, owed in the amount of $7,000, appears to be a consumer loan. Two automobile loans, totaling $27,000, and a residential mortgage, owed in the amount of $150,000, were reaffirmed in the petition. Applicant was granted a discharge in January 2003.

The SOR\n1\nalleges a security concern under Guideline F (financial considerations). Applicant\nsubmitted a response to the SOR that was received by DOHA on May 15, 2008. She\nadmitted the allegations contained in SOR subparagraphs 1.a, 1.d, 1.e, 1.f, 1.j, 1.m, 1.n,\n1.p and 1.q, denied all other allegations and requested a hearing. \nDEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE\nDEFENSE OFFICE OF HEARINGS AND APPEALS\nDecember 18, 2008\n\n Applicant\u2019s post-hearing submissions, AE 4-13, consist of bank statements verifying various checks\n2\nhaving been paid, most with copies of checks included. None of the checks are payable to any creditor alleged\nin the SOR and few are for a sum that is even closely connected to the amount of any debt alleged in the\nSOR. Accordingly, Applicant has failed to carry her burden of establishing that any of the checks represent\nsatisfaction, in whole or in part, of any allegation contained in the SOR.\n2\nThe case was assigned to me on September 9, 2008. A notice of hearing was\nissued on October 24, 2008, scheduling the hearing for November 14, 2008. An amended\nnotice of hearing was issued on November 10, 2008, rescheduling the hearing to\nNovember 13, 2008. The hearing was rescheduled at Applicant\u2019s request with the\nagreement of Department Counsel (Tr. pp. 18-19). The government submitted eight\ndocumentary exhibits that were marked as Government Exhibits (GE) 1-8 and admitted\ninto the record without objection. Applicant testified and submitted two documentary\nexhibits that were marked as Applicant Exhibits (AE) 1 and 2 and admitted into the record\nwithout objection. \nThe record was held open to provide Applicant the opportunity to submit additional\ndocumentation in support of her case. Eleven documents were timely received, marked as\nAE 3-13 and admitted into the record without objection.  Department Counsel\u2019s forwarding\n2\nmemorandum was marked as App. Ex. I and is included in the file. The transcript was\nreceived on November 21, 2008.      \nFindings of Fact\nApplicant\u2019s admissions to the SOR allegations are incorporated herein. In addition,\nafter a thorough review of the pleadings, testimony and exhibits, I make the following\nfindings of fact:\nApplicant is 49 years old. She has been employed as a patient care advocate by a\ndefense contractor since June 2006. She was continuously employed outside the defense\nindustry as a team leader from August 1992 until August 2000, and by a second company\nthat assumed the contract she was working under from August 2000 to August 2004.\nAlthough she listed continuous employment with four different employers from the time she\nwas given a severance from her longtime employer in August 2004 until the present, she\ntestified she was unemployed for a short period of time in or about May 2006 (Tr. pp. 39-\n40).\n  \nApplicant has been married since July 1996. She has an 11-year-old daughter.\nApplicant\u2019s husband has been continuously employed by the same employer during their\nmarriage. \nApplicant and her husband filed a Chapter 7 bankruptcy petition in July 2002. The\npetition lists seven creditors owed $40,500 in unsecured nonpriority claims. Six of those\ncreditors, totaling $33,500, appear to be credit cards and the seventh, owed in the amount\nof $7,000, appears to be a consumer loan. Two automobile loans, totaling $27,000, and\na residential mortgage, owed in the amount of $150,000, were reaffirmed in the petition.\nApplicant was granted a discharge in January 2003. \n\n  Regulation \u00b6\u00b6 C3.1.2.1.1.7 and C3.1.2.1.2.3.\n3\n  Regulation \u00b6 C6.1.1.1.\n4\n3\nApplicant testified the bankruptcy was caused by bad advice she received while\nattempting to obtain a debt consolidation loan. The loan officer advised her to not make\ncar payments as they came due and then declined to grant her the consolidation loan she\nhad sought (Tr. pp. 49-52).  \nThe SOR alleges 11 delinquent accounts that have been submitted for collection,\ntotaling $4,146. In her response to the SOR, Applicant admitted responsibility for seven of\nthose accounts, totaling $3,197. Four additional accounts were alleged in the SOR that had\nbeen charged off, totaling $12,777. Applicant admitted she was liable for one of those\naccounts, owed in the amount of $1,006. Also alleged were one past due account, owed\nin the amount of $114, and a judgment, owed in the amount fo $5,265. Applicant denied\nboth of those accounts.\nOne of the charged off accounts, owed in the amount of $5,770, represents the\nbalance after the repossession of one of the automobiles. Applicant and her husband\nreaffirmed in the Chapter 7 bankruptcy petition they filed in 2002. A second charged off\naccount, owed in the amount of $5,108, was discharged in that bankruptcy. Although\nApplicant testified she satisfied one or both of the other charged off accounts, she failed\nto submit proof of any payments having been made. (see: fn 2)\nApplicant submitted proof she satisfied the judgment alleged in the SOR. (AE 2 &\n3) She borrowed the money to pay the judgment from her parents-in-law. In response to\ninterrogatories she answered in November 2007, Applicant stated she had either satisfied\na number of the accounts alleged in the SOR or would make arrangements to pay others.\nShe testified she satisfied the past due account and several of the collection accounts.\nHowever, she again failed to submit proof of any payments having been made on any of\nthese accounts. (see: fn 2)\nApplicant\u2019s need to seek Chapter 7 bankruptcy protection clearly arose from the\nabuse of credit cards. In an effort to live more frugally, she sold her house and moved into\nan apartment. However, she and her husband shared the apartment with another person\nwho failed to pay her share of the rent, including after Applicant moved, resulting in the\njudgment being entered against her. In a continuing effort to live within their income,\nApplicant and her family are now living with her cousin.     \nPOLICIES\nPositions designated as ADP I and ADP II are classified as sensitive positions.  \n3\nThe standard to be met for assignment to sensitive duties is that, based on all available\ninformation, the person\u2019s loyalty, reliability, and trustworthiness are such that assigning the\nperson to sensitive duties is clearly consistent with the interests of national security.4\nTrustworthiness adjudications apply to cases forwarded to DOHA by the Defense Security\n\n Deputy Under Secretary of Defense (Counterintelligence and Security) Memorandum, dated\n5\nNovember 19, 2004.\n  Regulation \u00b6 C8.2.1.  \n6\n  Section 7 of Executive Order (EO) 10865. \n7\n  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14.\n8\n  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.\n9\n4\nService and Office of Personnel Management.  Department of Defense contractor\n5\npersonnel are afforded the right to the procedures contained in the Directive before any\nfinal unfavorable access determination is made.6\nAn Administrative Judge must consider the disqualifying and mitigating conditions\nin the Adjudicative Guidelines when evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a public trust\nposition. The Administrative Judge must also consider all available, reliable information\nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. The\nentire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole\nperson concept.\u201d  The protection of the national security is the paramount consideration,\nand any doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to sensitive information\nwill be resolved in favor of national security. Decisions are made in terms of the national\ninterest and are not determinations as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.7\nThe Government is required to present evidence to establish controverted facts\nalleged in the SOR.  The Applicant is responsible for presenting witnesses and other\n8\nevidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by\nDepartment Counsel.  The Applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining\n9\na favorable trustworthiness decision. \nAnalysis\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial\nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to abide by\nrules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability,\ntrustworthiness and ability to protect [sensitive] information. An individual who is financially\noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. . . .\n(Adjudicative Guideline [AG] 18)\nApplicant obtained a Chapter 7 bankruptcy discharge in January 2003, that was\ncaused by an abuse of consumer credit. She quickly acquired numerous new delinquent\naccounts that have been submitted for collection, charged off as bad debts, listed as past\ndue, or that resulted in a judgment being entered against her. She currently has\napproximately $12,000 in delinquent debt that remains outstanding. Disqualifying\n\n5\nConditions (DC) 19(a): inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts; and DC 19(c): a history\nof not meeting financial obligations apply.\nApplicant\u2019s financial problems are long standing and unresolved. They were\noriginally caused by an abuse of credit and have never been brought under control despite\nmost of that original debt having been discharged in January 2003. Applicant testified she\nsatisfied a number of the alleged delinquent accounts and the record was held for over\nthree weeks to provide her the opportunity to submit proof in support of that assertion.\nHowever, while she submitted bank statements and copies of checks she has written to\nvarious creditors, it is impossible to conclude that any of those relate to any debt alleged\nin the SOR. I have considered all mitigating conditions and conclude that none apply. \nThe objective of a trustworthiness determination is the fair-minded, commonsense\nassessment of a person\u2019s trustworthiness and fitness for access to sensitive information.\nIndeed, the \u201cwhole person\u201d concept recognizes we should view a person by the totality of\nher acts and omissions. Each case must be adjudged on its own merits, taking into\nconsideration all relevant circumstances, and applying sound judgment, mature thinking,\nand careful analysis.   \nConsidering all relevant and material facts and circumstances present in this case,\nthe whole person concept, the factors listed in \u00b6 6.3.1 through \u00b66.3.6 of the Directive, and\nthe applicable disqualifying and mitigating conditions, Applicant has failed to mitigate the\nfinancial considerations security concerns. She has not overcome the case against her nor\nsatisfied her ultimate burden of persuasion. It is not clearly consistent with the national\ninterest to grant Applicant access to sensitive information. \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as\nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 1.a-g:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.h:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraphs 1.i-q:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.r:\nFor Applicant\nConclusion  \n             \nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a public trust position.\nEligibility for access to sensitive information is denied.\nHenry Lazzaro\nAdministrative Judge\n\n",

Howry, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro Se\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nWHITE, David M., Administrative Judge:\nApplicant pled guilty to manslaughter in juvenile court for a gang-related murder\nthat occurred in 1996, when he was 16. He denied this felony arrest and conviction on\nhis current security application, and falsified the details of the incident and a later traffic\nconviction in a subsequent interview. Based upon a review of the case file, pleadings,\nexhibits, and testimony, eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nApplicant submitted his Electronic Questionnaires for Investigation Processing\n(e-QIP), on April 4, 2006. On July 31, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and\nAppeals (DOHA) issued Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security\nconcerns under Guidelines J and E. The action was taken under Executive Order\n10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as\namended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel\nSecurity Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the\nrevised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29,\n2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September\n1, 2006. \nApril 8, 2009\n\n2\nApplicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on August 26, 2008. He answered\nthe SOR in writing (AR) on September 7, 2008, and requested a hearing before an\nadministrative judge. Department Counsel was prepared to proceed on October 20,\n2008, and the case was assigned to a different administrative judge on the following\nday. DOHA issued a Notice of Hearing on November 3, 2008, setting the case to be\nheard on December 2, 2008. On November 12, 2008, Applicant requested to\nreschedule the hearing because he was leaving the following week to work in another\nstate. On November 18, 2008, DOHA issued a notice cancelling the hearing, and\nreassigned the case to me. After Applicant\u2019s company representative confirmed that he\nwould not be available until mid-January 2009, DOHA issued another Notice of Hearing\non December 17, 2008, and I convened the hearing as rescheduled on January 15,\n2009. The Government offered exhibits (GE) 1 through 5, which were admitted without\nobjection. The Government also offered HE II, a section of the applicable state criminal\ncode, to support a request that I take administrative notice of the fact that the provision\nunder which Applicant was originally charged was for murder. Applicant had no\nobjection, and administrative notice was taken of this fact. Applicant testified on his own\nbehalf. I granted Applicant\u2019s request to leave the record open until January 22, 2009, to\npermit him to submit additional evidence. On January 21, 2009, Applicant submitted the\nadditional evidence to Department Counsel, who forwarded it without objection to its\nconsideration. This evidence was admitted, marked AE A, and the record was closed.\nDOHA received the transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on January 26, 2009. \nFindings of Fact\nIn his Answer to the SOR, Applicant denied all of the factual allegations\nconcerning his criminal and personal conduct. Applicant is a 29-year-old employee of a\ndefense contractor. He has worked for his present employer since March 2005. He has\nnot served in the military, and has never held a security clearance except on an interim\nbasis. (GE 1 at 2, 6, 13, 18.)\nIn 1996, Applicant was involved in a gang-related incident during which a\nmember of his gang shot and killed a member of a different gang after a confrontation.\nIn 1998, two members of Applicant\u2019s gang were arrested on related charges, and\nidentified him as a gang member possibly involved in the murder. He was eventually\narrested in February 2000, shortly after being identified in a police photo lineup by a\nmember of the other gang, and charged with murder. He spent about ten months in jail\nawaiting trial. His attorney finally arranged a plea agreement under which he pled guilty\nto voluntary manslaughter, with gang affiliation and handgun felony enhancements, in\njuvenile court. He was sentenced to time served, a fine, and probation. He says he no\nlonger hangs out with the gang members, having severed ties with them at age 18. (AR\nat 2; GE 2; GE 4; GE 5; Tr. at 46, 50, 63.)\nWhen Applicant completed his e-QIP, he answered \u201cNo\u201d to question 23.a, that\nasked whether he had ever been charged with or convicted of a felony. (GE 1 at 16.)\nHis explanation was that he had asked his attorney how to answer a question asking\nwhether he had any felony convictions on a job application for a former employer, and\n\n3\nwas told that he did not have to list his manslaughter conviction because it was handled\nin juvenile court. This explanation is contradicted by Applicant\u2019s statement, on page 8 of\nhis e-QIP, that he began working for this same former employer in September 1999,\nsome five months before he was arrested, and by his testimony and statement to an\ninvestigator that his arrest took place while he was driving to work for that employer.\n(AR at 4. Tr. at 72.) He further said that he did not ask this attorney, or anyone else, for\nadvice concerning how to answer the broader question on his security clearance\napplication. He just decided he did not need to report it based on his lawyer\u2019s earlier\ncomment. (Tr. at 47, 52-54.)  \nApplicant was interviewed by an investigator from the Office of Personnel\nManagement (OPM) on January 10, 2007. The investigator asked him about the murder\ncharge. According to the investigator\u2019s report of investigation, which Applicant confirmed\nwas accurate in his January 8, 2008, sworn interrogatory response, Applicant described\nhis involvement as follows:\nSubject related that the incident occurred in 1996. Subject was 16 years\nold, and he and his cousin [name], had attended a party at a [name] (club\nthat serves no alcohol) in [town]. While at the club, a gunshot was heard\nand everybody in the club, exited and went home. Approximately two days\nlater, subject was approached by the [town] police department and\nquestioned about the incident. Subject was informed during the\nquestioning that a person had been killed at the [name] club. Subject\ninformed police that he had no knowledge who had committed the crime,\nand that he had no involvement in the incident. Subject was subsequently\nreleased with no further action. Approximately four (4) years later, Subject\nwas driving to work at the [name] company, when he was stopped by the\n[name] Sheriffs Department. Subject was placed under arrest for the\nmurder at the [name] club which occurred in 1996.\n(GE 2 at 3, 6, 7.) In further response to interrogatories, Applicant provided copies of his\nprobation officer\u2019s report detailing his June 27, 2000, description of the shooting. In that\nversion, Applicant said the incident began when the other gang members approached\nand threw gang signs, then sticks and rocks at him and his car as he and a friend sat\nacross the street from the club. He and his friend approached the others \u201cto find out\n\u2018what\u2019s up\u2019,\u201d when they started to run away. Applicant then saw \u201cthe other car\u201d chasing\nthem and heard gunshots. He then got back in his car and left. (GE 4 at 5.) This version\nmost closely tracks with what police were told by the surviving members of the other\ngang. They reported fleeing the initial confrontation when they realized they were\noutnumbered, and being chased by a car from which multiple shots were fired at them.\nOne of those shots struck the victim in the chest, from which he later died at the\nhospital. (GE 4 at 4.)\nDuring the hearing, Applicant said he and his cousins were inside the club when\nsome other members of his gang decided to leave. Shortly thereafter, the others called\nhim on the phone to ask him to come to a place where they were going to fight the other\n\n4\ngang members. He and his cousins went to the scene, got out of their car, and the\nmembers of the other gang started to flee. As Applicant and his cousins were getting\nback in their car, they heard several shots. They then returned to the club and continued\nto party. He gave differing versions of how and when he found out the victim had died.\n(Tr. at 67-79.)\nApplicant concluded his January 10, 2007, interview with the OPM investigator\nby stating that he had not had any law enforcement issues since the murder incident,\nand he did not feel that incident could be used to blackmail or coerce him to conduct\nany illegal act against the United States. (GE 2 at 4.) Subsequent investigation revealed\nthat he had another unreported violation resulting from his failure to stop for a school\nbus while driving on September 15, 2005. (GE 4 at 1.) He contested the $500 citation in\ntraffic court, where he was found guilty but his fine was reduced to $175. (GE 2 at 5.)\nDuring the hearing, he offered no valid explanation for not revealing this arrest and\nconviction to the OPM investigator during the January interview, except that he possibly\nthought he was being asked about more serious crimes than this offense. (Tr. at 55-63.)\nHe did subsequently admit the incident when re-interviewed about it. (GE 2 at 5.)\nApplicant said the birth of his daughter, now age eight, has changed his life and\nhe does nothing that could interfere with his opportunity to provide her financial support\nand continue parental visits. His aunt also wrote that she considers him to have become\nmuch more mature, considerate, and law-abiding after growing out of his rebellious\nteenage years. (AE A.) Applicant testified that he was very fortunate to have been tried\nas a juvenile for the murder/manslaughter charge, since he would probably still be in jail\nhad he been tried as an adult. He thought that since God and society had given him this\nsecond chance, the Government should also give him the chance to continue his\npresent employment by granting his security clearance. (Tr. at 80, 95.) Applicant\u2019s\ndemeanor and testimony during the hearing were not particularly forthright or credible.\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s over-arching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6\u00b6\n2(a) and 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of applicable guidelines in\nthe context of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The\nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person,\npast and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision.\n\n5\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to classified\ninformation will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I\nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on the\nevidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, \u201cThe applicant is\nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or\nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the\nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d Section 7\nof Executive Order 10865 provides that \u201cAny determination under this order adverse to\nan applicant shall be a determination in terms of the national interest and shall in no\nsense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d \nA person applying for access to classified information seeks to enter into a\nfiduciary relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of\nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\nAnalysis\nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct\nAG \u00b6 30 expresses the security concern pertaining to criminal conduct, \u201cCriminal\nactivity creates doubt about a person's judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. By its\nvery nature, it calls into question a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws,\nrules and regulations.\u201d AG \u00b6 31 describes conditions that could raise a security concern\nand may be disqualifying (DCs). The DC asserted by the Government was, \u201c(a) a single\nserious crime or multiple lesser offenses.\u201d (Tr. at 83.) As alleged in the SOR, Applicant\nwas arrested in 2000, and charged with a murder that occurred in 1996. Applicant pled\nguilty to voluntary manslaughter, as a lesser included offense of the murder charge, as\nwell as sentencing enhancements of firearm and gang conditions in the commission of a\nfelony, in juvenile court. He served about ten months of confinement, in addition to\nprobation, and paid a fine as a result. Although the evidence does not indicate that\nApplicant was the trigger-man, the victim\u2019s death resulted directly from a gang-on-gang\nconfrontation in which he was knowingly and voluntarily participating.\nAG \u00b6 32 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns (MCs).\nApplicant\u2019s termination of gang involvement and recent history of gainful employment\n\n6\ncreate some mitigation under two of them. These are: \u201c(a) so much time has elapsed\nsince the criminal behavior happened, or it happened under such unusual\ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's\nreliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;\u201d and, \u201c(d) there is evidence of successful\nrehabilitation; including but not limited to the passage of time without recurrence of\ncriminal activity, remorse or restitution, job training or higher education, good\nemployment record, or constructive community involvement.\u201d\nFor mitigation analysis, Applicant\u2019s SOR-listed criminal conduct and his criminal\nhistory must be evaluated as a whole, not piece by piece. His 2000 conviction in juvenile\ncourt and 2006 traffic court conviction were indicative of poor judgment and a lack of\nself-control, as well as a willingness to flaunt rules and regulations. Given the\nrecklessness of this conduct, one of which resulted in a death and the other that put\nschool children at risk, Applicant did not establish strong mitigation of the concerns\narising from his criminal history. His recent good employment record, job training, and\nperiod of abstinence from gang involvement are evidence that support successful\nrehabilitation. The serious nature of his former criminal activity, however, leads to the\nconclusion that on balance it is still too soon to be confident that such behavior is\nunlikely to recur, and no longer casts doubt on his reliability, trustworthiness and\njudgment. \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct\nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the security concern pertaining to personal conduct:\nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or\nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions\nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect\nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful\nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other\nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process.\nThe following will normally result in an unfavorable clearance action or\nadministrative termination of further processing for clearance eligibility:\n(a) refusal, or failure without reasonable cause, to undergo or\ncooperate with security processing, including but not limited to\nmeeting with a security investigator for subject interview,\ncompleting security forms or releases, and cooperation with\nmedical or psychological evaluation; and,\n(b) refusal to provide full, frank and truthful answers to lawful\nquestions of investigators, security officials, or other official\nrepresentatives in connection with a personnel security or\ntrustworthiness determination.\n\n7\nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be\ndisqualifying. The Government asserted that Applicant\u2019s statements and actions support\nconcerns under two DCs:\n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from\nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or\nsimilar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment\nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance\neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities; and\n(b) deliberately providing false or misleading information concerning\nrelevant facts to an employer, investigator, security official, competent\nmedical authority, or other official government representative.\nApplicant completed his e-QIP personnel security questionnaire in April 2006. On\nthe question that asked whether he had ever been charged with or convicted of any\nfelony offense, he responded \u201cNo,\u201d and did not report having been arrested for, and\ncharged with murder in a case that resulted in his juvenile court conviction for\nmanslaughter, with firearm and gang conditions in the commission of a felony. He did\nthis because he did not want to reveal this adverse information, and possibly thought he\nmight not have to because it was ultimately handled by a juvenile court. This was a\ndeliberate omission, concealment, and falsification of relevant facts from his e-QIP,\nestablishing security concerns under AG \u00b6 16(a), as alleged in SOR \u00b6 2.a.  \nWhen confronted in January 2007 with the reports of his arrest and conviction for\nthe 1996 homicide, Applicant admitted that occurred, but told the investigator a very\nminimized version of events in which he was attending a party at a youth club, heard a\ngunshot, and went home. He made it sound like his attorney convinced him to plead\nguilty to something concerning which he had no actual criminal involvement. As alleged\nin SOR \u00b6 2.b, he deliberately failed to disclose that the murder was a gang-related\nshooting from a car. He also completely omitted any information about his voluntary\nparticipation in the gang confrontation that led directly to the killing. Finally, during this\nsame interview, he falsely stated that he had no subsequent law enforcement issues\nwhen he had been cited for, tried, and convicted of failing to stop for a school bus within\nthe preceding year and a half. His attempted justification for this falsification, as alleged\nin SOR \u00b6 2.c, was that the investigator did not ask him directly about this second\nincident. These facts establish substantial security concerns under AG \u00b6 16(b). \nAG \u00b6 17 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns:\n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission,\nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts;\n(b) the refusal or failure to cooperate, omission, or concealment was\ncaused or significantly contributed to by improper or inadequate advice of\nauthorized personnel or legal counsel advising or instructing the individual\n\n8\nspecifically concerning the security clearance process. Upon being made\naware of the requirement to cooperate or provide the information, the\nindividual cooperated fully and truthfully;\n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is\nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is\nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability,\ntrustworthiness, or good judgment;\n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling\nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the\nstressors, circumstances, or factors that caused untrustworthy, unreliable,\nor other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to recur;\n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate\nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress;\n(f) the information was unsubstantiated or from a source of questionable\nreliability; and,\n(g) association with persons involved in criminal activity has ceased or\noccurs under circumstances that do not cast doubt upon the individual's\nreliability, trustworthiness, judgment, or willingness to comply with rules\nand regulations.\nAG \u00b6 17(a) is not supported by the evidence in this case. Applicant revealed the\nrelevant facts concerning his criminal history only in response to specific confrontation,\nand even then his attempts to minimize his criminality were more damage control than\nany good-faith effort to honestly reveal what occurred. He could not even present a\nconsistent version of events during his hearing, and his January 2007 disclosures about\nhis criminal past were in themselves false and misleading.\nEven if Applicant\u2019s factually impossible explanation (that his attorney told him he\ndid not have to report a juvenile court conviction in response to a job application asking\nabout prior felony convictions he was filling out for a job that he held for many months\nbefore he was unexpectedly arrested) were true, it would not provide mitigation under\nAG \u00b6 17(b). That MC requires that improper legal advice contributing to the\nconcealment have been rendered specifically concerning the security clearance\nprocess. Applicant denied having asked anyone for such guidance in completing his e-\nQIP, and offered no justification for falsifying the details of his involvement in the murder\nand the existence of his 2006 traffic conviction during his January 2007 interview.\nApplicant\u2019s attempts to minimize and conceal his criminal history were both\nfrequent and recent. Nothing in this record, including Applicant\u2019s various versions of\nevents during hearing testimony, indicates that such deceptions would be unlikely to\nrecur, or that they do not cast continuing doubt on his reliability, trustworthiness, and\n\n9\ngood judgment. Accordingly, no mitigation was established under AG \u00b6\u00b6 17(c) or (d).\nHis consistent and repetitive minimization of his culpability demonstrates his ongoing\nvulnerability to manipulation or duress by those who could threaten to reveal more\ndamaging information about him and his past, precluding mitigation under AG \u00b6 17(e).\nThe alleged falsifications are fully substantiated by this record, so AG \u00b6 17(f)\ndoes not apply. Applicant\u2019s gang involvement was not alleged as the disqualifying\npersonal conduct, and while those associations have largely ceased, according to him,\nthe former association provides ongoing motivation for the falsifications that raise the\npersonal conduct security concerns. Accordingly, ongoing doubts about his reliability,\ntrustworthiness, judgment, and willingness to comply with rules and regulations preclude\na finding of mitigation under AG \u00b6 17(g).   \nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an\napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances established by the record evidence. The\nadministrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6\n2(a): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security\nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration\nof the guidelines and the whole person concept.    \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant\u2019s conduct of security\nconcern involved a juvenile court homicide conviction for an incident when he was 16\nyears old, as well as deliberate falsifications about that event and a subsequent serious\ntraffic conviction in connection with the security clearance process. These falsifications\noccurred in April 2006 and January 2007, during processing of the present clearance\nrequest. His participation in each incident of security concern was both knowing and\nvoluntary. His involvement in the homicide was more than 12 years ago when he was a\njuvenile, but his false descriptions of his criminal history were frequent, recent, and\ndirectly connected to the security clearance process. The manslaughter resulted from\ngang-related peer pressure that Applicant has avoided more recently, but his attempts\n\n10\nto minimize his criminal past demonstrate his ongoing vulnerability to exploitation or\nduress concerning those matters. \nApplicant\u2019s motivation and actions to become a good parent and provider are\ncommendable. His disassociation from former gang connections, renewal of extended\nfamily ties, and gainful employment are all good steps toward establishing responsibility.\nHe did not, however, demonstrate either respect for or understanding of the need for\nintegrity in the security process, so recurrence of untrustworthy behavior cannot be said\nto be unlikely. \nOverall, the record evidence generates substantial doubts concerning Applicant\u2019s\npresent eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. He has not met his burden to\nmitigate the security concerns arising from his criminal conduct and personal conduct.\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline J:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline E:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.b:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.c:\nAgainst Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a\nsecurity clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.\n                                             \nDAVID M. WHITE\nAdministrative Judge\n",

During the last four years he has become a responsible father and good \nworker. His current behavior shows reliability, judgment, and trustworthiness. Eligibility \nfor access to classified information is granted.  \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nOn January 2, 2007, Applicant submitted a security clearance application. On \nMay 19, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement \nof Reasons (SOR) to him, pursuant to Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation Within Industry, dated February 20, 1960, as amended and modified, and \nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security \nClearance Review Program (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as modified and \nDecember 17, 2009\n\n \n2 \n \n \n                                           \nrevised.1 The SOR alleges security concerns under Guideline J (Criminal Conduct). The \nSOR detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative finding \nunder the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or \ncontinue a security clearance for him, and it recommended referral to an administrative \njudge to determine whether a clearance should be granted, denied or revoked. \n \nOn June 9, 2009, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations, and requested a \nhearing before an administrative judge. The case was assigned to me on July 28, 2009. \nDOHA issued a notice of hearing on August 6, 2009. The hearing was convened as \nscheduled on August 27, 2009. The government offered Government Exhibits (GE) 1 \nthrough 6, which were admitted without objection. Applicant testified on his own behalf, \npresented one witness, and submitted Applicant Exhibits (AE) 1 and 2, which were \nadmitted without objection. DOHA received the transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on \nSeptember 3, 2009.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant admitted all the SOR factual allegations. His admissions are \nincorporated herein as findings of fact. After a thorough review of the evidence of \nrecord, and having considered Applicant\u2019s demeanor and testimony, I make the \nfollowing additional findings of fact. \n \nApplicant is a 24-year-old warehouse clerk II working for a defense contractor. \nHe graduated from high school in 2003. He is engaged to be married to the mother of \nhis three children, ages 4, 3, and 18 months.  \n \nIn August 2004, at age 19, Applicant pawned a karaoke machine he knew was \nstolen. He was initially charged with Grand Larceny. He was found guilty of Petit \nLarceny, and sentenced, in part, to 180 days jail (suspended). In October 2004, \nApplicant was found guilty and fined for driving his girlfriend\u2019s car without a driver\u2019s \nlicense.  \n \nIn February 2005, at age 19, Applicant and two of his friends strong-armed a \nconvenience store clerk and stole beer and other merchandise. He was convicted of \nPetit Larceny and sentenced to 180 days jail (170 days suspended). He served 6 days \nin jail and paid a fine. In April 2005, Applicant was charged with illegal possession of \napproximately one ounce of marijuana. He claimed a friend gave him the marijuana to \nhold for a couple of days. A police officer found the marijuana during a search of \nApplicant\u2019s girlfriend\u2019s car and Applicant admitted it was his marijuana. The charge was \ndismissed pursuant to a first time offender diversion program. Applicant paid a fine, was \n \n1  On Aug. 30, 2006, the Under Secretary of Defense (Intelligence) directed application of revised \nAdjudicative Guidelines in all adjudications and other determinations made under the Directive and \nDepartment of Defense (DoD) Regulation 5200.2-R, Personnel Security Program (Regulation), dated Jan. \n1987, as amended, in which the SOR was issued on or after Sep. 1, 2006.  \n \n\n \n3 \n \n \nplaced on one-year probation, and was required to complete a drug counseling \nprogram. \n \nSince April 2005, Applicant has changed his lifestyle. While on probation, he was \nrequired to stay away from the bad influence of his drug-using friends to avoid \nrevocation of his probation. Since then, most of these friends have left the area and he \nno longer associates with drug users. In September 2008, Applicant was diagnosed with \ncongestive heart failure and has been required to take medications. Because of his \ndiagnosis, Applicant no longer uses illegal drugs or consumes alcoholic beverages.  \n \nApplicant became engaged to the mother of his three children in December \n2008. He has become a responsible father to his children and a family man. Applicant \nattends church with his family and believes his participation in church activities keeps \nhim grounded. He has been successfully working for a government contractor since \nMarch 2005. He is considered to be a good worker and has been promoted. Applicant \nbelieves he will be promoted to a supervisory position if he is granted access to \nclassified information.  \n \nApplicant expressed sincere remorse for his past behavior. He promised that his \nquestionable behavior will not happen again. He disclosed all of his questionable \nbehavior on his security clearance application and in a sworn statement to a \ngovernment investigator. I find he was candid and forthcoming at his hearing.  \n \nPolicies \n \n \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the \nExecutive Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security, \nemphasizing that \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy \nv. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the \nauthority to control access to information bearing on national security and to determine \nwhether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. \nat 527. The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified.    \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). These guidelines are not \ninflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these \nguidelines are applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and \ncommonsense decision. An administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable.  \n \nThe government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \n\n \n4 \n \n \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. Clearance decisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and \nshall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the [A]pplicant concerned.\u201d  See \nExec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 7. See also Executive Order 12968 (Aug. 2, 1995), Section 3. Thus, \nnothing in this Decision should be construed to suggest that I have based this decision, \nin whole or in part, on any express or implied determination as to Applicant\u2019s allegiance, \nloyalty, or patriotism.  \n \nInitially, the government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the \ncriteria listed therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 \nat 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).      \n \nOnce the government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it \nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue [his or her] security \nclearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). The burden of \ndisproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the government. See ISCR Case No. \n02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, \nif they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b).   \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct \n \n \nUnder Guideline J, the security concern is that criminal activity \u201ccreates doubt \nabout a person's judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into \nquestion a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules and regulations.\u201d AG \n\u00b6 30.  \n \n \nFrom August 2004 to April 2005, Applicant committed four offenses, three of \nwhich were serious. His behavior raises security concerns under AG \u00b6 31(a) \u201ca single \nserious crime or multiple lesser offenses,\u201d and AG \u00b6 31(c) \u201callegation or admission of \ncriminal conduct, regardless of whether the person was formally charged, formally \nprosecuted or convicted.\u201d  \n \n\n \n5 \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 32 lists four conditions that could mitigate the criminal conduct security \nconcerns raised under AG \u00b6 31: \n \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur \nand does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, trustworthiness, or \ngood judgment; \n \n(b) the person was pressured or coerced into committing the act and those \npressures are no longer present in the person's life; \n \n(c) evidence that the person did not commit the offense; and \n \n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including but not limited \nto the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, remorse or \nrestitution, job training or higher education, good employment record, or \nconstructive community involvement. \n \n \nAfter considering all the mitigating conditions, I find that AG \u00b6\u00b6 32 (a) and (d) \napply. Applicant\u2019s last offense was in February 2005. He successfully completed all the \nterms of his probation and participated in drug counseling. There is no evidence to show \nApplicant has been involved in any further questionable behavior.  \n \nAfter February 2005, Applicant changed his lifestyle. He no longer associates \nwith drug-using friends and avoids any bad influence from friends. Furthermore, \nApplicant no longer uses illegal drugs or consumes alcoholic beverages. Applicant \nbecame engaged to the mother of his three children in December 2008. He has become \na responsible father and participates in church activities. He has been successful \nworking for a government contractor since March 2005. He is considered to be a good \nworker and has been promoted. Applicant believes he will be promoted to a supervisory \nposition if he is granted access to classified information.  \n \nApplicant expressed remorse for his past behavior. He promised that his \nquestionable behavior will not happen again. He was candid and forthcoming \nthroughout the security clearance process. I find Applicant has learned his lesson and is \nrehabilitated. The Guideline J security concern is mitigated. \n \nWhole Person Concept \n Under the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n\n \n6 \n \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \nThe ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security clearance \nmust be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the \nguidelines and the whole person concept. AG \u00b6 2(c).   \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant is a young man who has \nmatured during the last four years. Since April 2005, Applicant has changed his lifestyle. \nHe has been successful working for a defense contractor. He no longer associates with \nor is influenced by drug users. Furthermore, Applicant no longer uses illegal drugs or \nconsumes alcoholic beverages. Applicant has become a responsible father, and \nparticipates in church activities with his family. He has been candid and forthcoming \nthroughout the security clearance process. Applicant expressed remorse for his \nquestionable behavior and is resolute about avoiding similar behavior. These factors \nshow responsibility, good judgment, and reliability. On balance, I conclude that \nApplicant\u2019s favorable evidence is sufficient to mitigate the security concerns arising from \nhis criminal conduct.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:          \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline J:  \n \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.d: \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue eligibility for a security \nclearance for Applicant. Eligibility for a security clearance is granted. \n \n \n \n____________________________ \nJUAN J. RIVERA \nAdministrative Judge \n",

Nagel, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro Se\nApril 7, 2008\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nMOGUL, Martin H., Administrative Judge:\nApplicant submitted his Security Clearance Application (SF 86), on December 5,\n2006. On November 19, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA)\nissued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns under Guidelines\nG and E for Applicant. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865,\nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended;\nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security\nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the revised\nadjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and\neffective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n \nApplicant replied to the SOR (RSOR) in writing on January 7, 2008, and\nrequested a hearing before an Administrative Judge. The case was assigned to this\nAdministrative Judge on January 31, 2008. DOHA issued a notice of hearing on\nFebruary 7, 2008, and I convened the hearing as scheduled on March 6, 2008, in San\nDiego, California. The Government offered Exhibits (Ex) 1 through 4, which were\nreceived without objection. Applicant testified on his own behalf, and three additional\nindividuals testified on behalf of Applicant. He also submitted Ex A through D. I granted\nApplicant\u2019s request to keep the record open until March 14, 2008, to submit additional\n\n2\ndocument.  On March 13, 2008, he submitted a 23 page post hearing submission, which\nhas been marked as Ex E, and entered into evidence without objection, and the record\nclosed on that date. DOHA received the transcript of the hearing (Tr) on March 14,\n2008. Based upon a review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility\nfor access to classified information is granted. \nFindings of Fact\nIn his RSOR, Applicant admitted the SOR allegations 1.b, under Guideline G,\nand 2.a. and 2.b., under Guideline E with explanations. He denied 1.a. under Guideline\nG. The admitted allegations are incorporated herein as findings of fact. \nAfter a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, including\nApplicant's RSOR, the admitted documents, and the testimony of Applicant and the\nother witnesses, and upon due consideration of that evidence, I make the additional\nfindings of fact: \nApplicant is 46 years old. He is married and he has one stepchild. He served for\n20 years in the United States Navy, and he received an Honorable Discharge. He is\nemployed by a defense contractor, and he seeks a DoD security clearance in\nconnection with his employment in the defense sector.\nParagraph 1 (Guideline G - Alcohol Consumption) \nThe Government alleges that Applicant is ineligible for clearance because he has\nengaged in excessive alcohol consumption. The following are the allegations as they\nare cited in the SOR:\n1.a. Applicant is alleged to have consumed alcohol, at times to excess and to the\npoint of intoxication, from approximately 1979 to at least May 2007. Applicant testified\nthat he started consuming alcohol as a teenager and when he joined the military\nDecember drank at times to excess. For the last 15 years, Applicant consumes alcohol\non a moderate level, and while he still drinks alcoholic beverages, the amount has\ndecreased since his 2006 arrest to no more than three beers at one time. He also\ntestified credibly that since the DUI, he has not driven and will never drive again after\nconsuming alcohol. \n \n1.b. On December 3, 2006, Applicant was arrested and charged with (1) Driving\nUnder the Influence of Alcohol (DUI), and (2) Driving While Having an 0.08% or Higher\nBlood Alcohol Content.  He found guilty on March 2007, and he was sentenced was to\nfive years probation. Applicant was ordered to complete the First Conviction Program,\npay a fine, complete community service, attend a MADD Impact panel, and attend three\nAlcoholics Anonymous meetings. Applicant has completed all of his requirements. \nApplicant testified that on the day of this incident, he had consumed\napproximately 12 beers from noon until he drove at around five in the afternoon. He\nstated that was more than he usually drank in one day, but on that day he and his wife\nhad an argument. When he was stopped, his blood alcohol measured .16, and he\n\n3\nended up spending the night in jail. The next day when he got out, he immediately\ncalled his supervisor to inform him of his DUI arrest. His supervisor, during his\ntestimony, verified that he was phoned by Applicant on the day of his release to inform\nhim of Applicant\u2019s arrest. \nParagraph 2 (Guideline E - Personal Conduct)\nThe Government alleges in this paragraph that Applicant is ineligible for\nclearance because he furnished untruthful information to the Government. \n2.a. Applicant completed a signed, sworn Security Clearance Application (SCA)\non December 5, 2006 (Ex 1). He answered a series of questions under Section 23,\nregarding his police record. Question C asks \u201cAre there currently any charges pending\nagainst you for any criminal offense?\u201d Applicant answered \u201cNo.\u201d The Government\nalleges that Applicant\u2019s deliberately failed to list the pending charges from his December\n3, 2006 arrest as set forth in 1.b., above.\nApplicant testified that he completed the SCA on December 1, 2006, and at that\ntime he had not yet been arrested. He submitted it to another individual within his\ncompany, on that date and indicated to him that it was ready to be forwarded. The DUI\narrest happened on December 3, 2006.The document was submitted on December 4,\n2006, by that individual who testified at the hearing. Applicant signed the document on\nDecember 5, 2006, indicating that everything he had included on the document was true\nand correct. \nThe evidence is clear that Applicant did not intend to mislead the Government on\nthe SCA. He completed the document and submitted it to be forwarded, before he was\narrested, and he believe that it had been forwarded before his arrest. Although it\nactually was submitted one day after Applicant\u2019s arrest, I find nothing in the record to\nindicate that Applicant in any way was attempting to hide his DUI arrest from the\nGovernment or his employer. In fact, as discussed above, Applicant called his\nsupervisor immediately after being released from prison to inform him of his arrest for\nDUI. \n2.b. During a 1987 investigation by Naval Investigative Service, Applicant initially\ndenied drug use after he received a positive drug screening through urinalysis, even\nthough he had consumed amphetamine mixed with alcohol prior to the testing. \nAt the hearing, Applicant explained that during his first year in the Navy, he used\nmethamphetamine on one occasion after he had broken up with his girlfriend, when it\nwas offered to him at a party. Shortly after that, he showed positive during a random\ndrug test, and he conceded that at first he denied that he had used any drugs.\nHowever, when the matter proceeded to a Captain\u2019s Mast, Applicant did admit that he\nhad used drugs. He was granted a second opportunity to remain in the Navy, with the\nunderstanding that he must never use drugs again. Applicant testified most credibly that\nhe very much appreciated this second chance, and since that event in 1987, he has\nnever used any illegal substance. \n\n4\nMitigation\nThree witnesses, who know Applicant from his present employment, testified on\nhis behalf. They all were extremely positive in describing Applicant as a most honest\nand conscientious employee. His direct supervisor also verified that Applicant kept him\ninformed of his arrest, immediately upon his release from jail, and continued to inform\nhim as to the status of the case.  One of the other witnesses traced the timeline of\nApplicant\u2019s completion and submission of his SCA, and verified that Applicant did not\nattempt to mislead the Government when he completed the SCA. \nApplicant submitted 11 character letters from individuals, who have known him in\neither professional or personal status or both (Ex D). They all were quite laudatory,\ndescribing Applicant as \u201chonest, hard working, and very responsible.\u201d The letters from\nindividuals, who have known him outside of the work environment, confirmed that they\nhave never seen him consume alcohol to excess. \nIn his post hearing documents (Ex E) Applicant submitted his current\nPerformance Development Summary. His Overall Performance Rating was \u201cExceeds\nExpectations,\u201d which is the second from the highest rating, and he was described as \u201ca\nproductive and highly valuable asset \u201d to his employer. He also included his Naval\nEvaluation Reports and Counseling Records for years 2003 and 2004. In his most\nrecent evaluation, he was described as a \u201ctop notch Petty Officer who demonstrates\nkeen foresight and is an inspiration to all who observe him. His efforts directly contribute\nto the overall success of this command and its mission.\u201d\nFinally, in Ex E, Applicant explained that his 2006 DUI conviction cost him\napproximately $7,672, as well as a great deal of time and requirements. He stressed\nthat he would never again find himself in a position where he would drive after\nconsuming any alcoholic beverages.   \nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6\n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as\nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available,\nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in\nmaking a decision.\n\n5\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of\nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information)\nAnalysis\nGuideline G - Alcohol Consumption\nApplicant's alcohol consumption has resulted in one DUI arrest and\nconviction, occurring in 2006.\nThe Government established that Applicant was involved in an\nalcohol-related incident away from work, and binge alcohol consumption to the point of\nimpaired judgement on one occasion. Disqualifying Conditions (DC) 22. (a) and (c)\napply to this case.  \nAs stated above, Applicant admitted to currently drinking, but only in\nmoderation, and he never drives after drinking. I find that Mitigating Condition (MC) 23.\n(a) applies as the behavior was so infrequent, only one DUI in his life, which he\nsincerely regrets, that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s\ncurrent reliability and trustworthiness. Paragraph 1 is found for Applicant.\n\n6\nGuideline E - Personal Conduct \nWith respect to Guideline E, when Applicant completed his SCA it was\ntrue and correct. While it was forwarded to the Government one day after his arrest for\nDUI, I find that Applicant did not knowingly or wilfully furnish untruthful information to the\nGovernment. His initial denial of using drugs in 1987 was misinformation that was\nsubmitted to a Government investigator.  \nIn reviewing the DC under Guideline E, I conclude that DC 16. (b) applies\nbecause Applicant deliberately provide false and misleading information to the\nGovernment investigator in 1987. However, MC 17. (c) applies because so much time\nhas passed since this offense, and the behavior occurred on only one occasion, that it is\nunlikely to recur and it does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness\nor good judgement.  Applicant has mitigated this allegation. I resolve Guideline E for\nApplicant. \nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate\nan Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the\nApplicant\u2019s conduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should\nconsider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature,\nextent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct,\nto include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct;\n(4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which\nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other\npermanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for\npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or\nrecurrence.\u201d Under AG \u00b6 2 (c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility\nfor a security clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful\nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.      \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Based on all of the factors\ndiscussed above, including the positive testimony form his witnesses, the character\nletters and employment reviews, plus Applicant\u2019s credible sincere remorse, I find that\nApplicant is a decent person, who will continue to control his alcohol consumption, so\nthat in the future, he will not find himself in the position of driving after he has consumed\nalcohol. \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\n\n7\nParagraph 1, Guideline G\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a.:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b.:\nFor  Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline J:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a.:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.b.:\nFor Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is\nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.

Duffy, Esq., Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro Se\n\nDepartment Counsel does not challenge the Judge\u2019s favorable findings and conclusions under Guideline H.\n1\n2\nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant Applicant a security\nclearance.  On May 12, 2008, DOHA issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the\nbasis for that decision\u2014security concerns raised under Guideline H (Drug Involvement) and\nGuideline E (Personal Conduct) of Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as\namended) (Directive).  Applicant requested a hearing, which was held on August 13, 2008.  On\nSeptember 19, 2008, after the hearing, Administrative Judge Paul J. Mason granted Applicant\u2019s\nrequest for a security clearance.  Department Counsel timely appealed pursuant to the Directive \u00b6\u00b6\nE3.1.28 and E3.1.30.1\nDepartment Counsel raises the following issues on appeal: (a) whether the Judge erred in his\napplication of Personal Conduct Mitigating Conditions 17(c) and 17(d); and (b) whether the Judge\u2019s\nfavorable whole-person analysis is unsustainable because it is unsupported by the totality of the\nrecord evidence.  For the following reasons, the Board reverses the Judge\u2019s favorable decision. \nWhether the Record Supports the Judge\u2019s Factual Findings\nA.  The Judge made the following pertinent findings of fact:\nOn November 24, 2006, Applicant certified that the information he provided in his security\nclearance application was true and made in good faith.  Yet, in response to question 24 a., requiring\ninformation about drug use since the age of 16 or in the last 7 years, Applicant answered \u201cno,\u201d even\nthough he used marijuana about once a week between 2001 and late 2004 or early 2005.  He initially\ncharacterized the omission as a mistake at the hearing, but he knew he was hiding four years of\nmarijuana use with his \u201cno\u201d answer to question 24 a.  He answered \u201cno\u201d to question 24 a. because\nhe believed that telling the truth would spoil his chances of receiving a security clearance.  \nDepartment Counsel does not specifically challenge any of the Judge\u2019s findings.  He does,\nhowever, describe record evidence in the statement of facts portion of his brief that are not\nmentioned in the Judge\u2019s decision.  The Board concludes that some of this evidence is relevant to\na resolution of the issues raised on appeal.  The pertinent evidence is as follows: Prior to the hearing,\nApplicant responded to two sets of interrogatories.  Because his responses to the first set of\ninterrogatories were unclear, Applicant was sent another set, which he signed on October 22, 2007.\nIn response to the second set of interrogatories, Applicant denied ever purchasing any illegal\nsubstance.  At the hearing, however, Applicant admitted that he purchased \u201cnickel\u201d and \u201cdime\u201d\nquantities of marijuana from his friends.   \n\n\u201c[T]he offense is so minor, or the behavior is so infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances\n2\nthat it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.\u201d\n\u201c[T]he individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling to change the behavior or taken\n3\nother positive steps to alleviate the stressors, circumstances, or factors that caused untrustworthy, unreliable, or other\ninappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to recur.\u201d\n3\nB. Discussion\nThe Appeal Board\u2019s review of the Judge\u2019s findings of fact is limited to determining if they\nare supported by substantial evidence\u2013\u201csuch relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept\nas adequate to support a conclusion in light of all the contrary evidence in the same record.\u201d\nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.32.1.  \u201cThis is something less th an the weight of the evidence, and the possibility\nof drawing two inconsistent conclusions from the evidence does not prevent an administrative\nagency\u2019s finding from being supported bu substantial evidence.\u201d  Consolo v. Federal Maritime\nComm\u2019n, 383 U.S. 607, 620-21 (1966).  In evaluating the Judge\u2019s findings, we are required to give\ndeference to the Judge\u2019s credibility determinations.  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1.\nAs Department Counsel does not specifically challenge the Judge\u2019s findings of fact, the\nissues raised on appeal are more appropriately analyzed in terms of challenges to the Judge\u2019s\nconclusions.  This analysis is included in the following section.\n \nWhether the Record Supports the Judge\u2019s Ultimate Conclusions\nA. Conclusions\nThe Judge reached the following pertinent conclusions: The government established a case\nfor disqualification under Guideline E, but Applicant mitigated the security concerns.  Specifically,\n regarding the Applicant\u2019s hearing statement indicating the omission was a mistake, the Judge did\nnot believe that Applicant was trying to conceal his marijuana use a second time, given the detailed\naccount he provided of his marijuana history in his answers to interrogatory questions and the\ngenerally credible nature of Applicant\u2019s testimony.  Also, the Judge concluded that Personal Conduct\nMitigating Conditions 17(c)  and 17(d)  were applicable because Applicant\u2019s deliberate falsification\n2\n3\noccurred only once, even though the falsification occurred less than 16 months before the hearing.\nAdditionally, the Judge concluded that the two mitigating conditions applied because within the last\nthree and closer to four years, Applicant admitted the illegality of his drug use, stopped using\nmarijuana, discontinued his ties with his drug-using friends, and developed a good work reputation\nbecause of his trustworthiness and reliability.  Regarding the whole-person analysis, the Judge\nconcluded that weighing against the deliberate falsification that occurred less than 16 months ago\nis favorable evidence indicating that Applicant will not repeat this conduct in the future, specifically\nhis ceasing of marijuana use driven by a concern for his future, his not wanting to be caught by a\ndrug test, the ceasing of his association with drug users, his good employment record since 2005, his\n\nTranscript, p. 18.\n4\n4\ncoworker\u2019s favorable assessment of his professionalism and dependability, and his remedial action\nof paying off expensive, high-interest loans.\nB. Discussion\nA Judge is required to \u201cexamine the relevant data and articulate a satisfactory explanation\nfor\u201d the decision, \u201cincluding a \u2018rational connection between the facts found and the choice made.\u2019\u201d\nMotor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass\u2019n of the United States v. State Farm Mut. Auto Ins. Co., 463 U.S. 29, 43\n(1983) (quoting Burlington Truck Lines Inc. v. United States, 371 U.S. 156, 168 (1962)).  \u201c[N]o one\nhas a right to a security clearance. . . The general standard is that a clearance may be granted only\nwhen \u2018clearly consistent with the interests of national security.\u2019\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan,\n484 U.S. 581, 528 (1988).  The Appeal Board may reverse a Judge\u2019s decision to grant, deny, or\nrevoke a security clearance if it is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.3.\nDepartment Counsel contends that the Judge\u2019s decision is not sustainable because he\nerroneously applied Mitigating Conditions 17(c) and 17(d) in Applicant\u2019s favor when the evidence\ndid not support it.  Department Counsel correctly points out that the Judge\u2019s application of the\nmitigating conditions was predicated largely on his determination that Applicant\u2019s deliberate\nfalsification occurred only once.  Department Counsel\u2019s assertion that the evidence does not support\nthe Judge\u2019s characterization has merit.  In addition to the act of falsification alleged in the statement\nof reasons, Applicant responded \u201cNo\u201d to an interrogatory question asking whether or not he had ever\npurchased illegal drugs, when, in fact, he had purchased marijuana.  At the hearing, when he was\ninitially asked about the circumstances of his answer to question 24 of the security clearance\napplication, Applicant indicated that his response to the question was a product of an honest mistake\narising from a misreading of the question.  After more questioning by the Judge, Applicant stated,\n\u201cOn the first one, I\u2019m going to be honest,\u201d  and then proceeded to admit that when he was answering\n4\nquestion 24, he thought saying he had smoked marijuana would hinder him from getting a security\nclearance.  Although the Judge concluded that Applicant\u2019s initial explanation about his question 24\nanswer was not a second attempt to conceal his marijuana use, Department Counsel argues\npersuasively that, irrespective of motive, Applicant\u2019s \u201cmistake\u201d explanation at the hearing was, on\nits face, untruthful.  Given the record evidence to the contrary, the Judge\u2019s conclusion that\nApplicant\u2019s falsification occurred only once is not sustainable, and as a result his application of\nMitigating Conditions 17(c) And 17(d) are significantly undercut.\nDepartment Counsel also persuasively argues that other components listed in Mitigating\nCondition 17(c) are not supported by the record evidence.  No evidence was presented to indicate\nthat Applicant\u2019s falsification occurred under unique circumstances that were unlikely to recur.  The\nrecord evidence indicates that Applicant provided the false answer for the predictable reason that he\nfeared his true record would diminish his chances of receiving a security clearance.  The record\n\n5\nevidence also indicates that the making of false statements by Applicant did, in fact, recur.\nMitigating Condition 17(c) also speaks in terms of the passage of time since the incident.  The Board\ndoes not set forth bright line parameters concerning the amount of time passage necessary to mitigate\nsecurity-significant behavior.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 99-0018 at 4 (App. Bd. Apr. 11, 2000).\nNevertheless, regarding the facts and circumstances of this case, which include an initial falsification\nthat occurred 16 months prior to the close of the record, and evidence of lack of candor that occurred\nsubsequent to the initial falsification including the date of the hearing, there is insufficient evidence\nto support the notion that so much time has passed that the behavior does not cast doubt on\nApplicant\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.\nRegarding Mitigating Condition 17(d), the Judge found that it applied because Applicant\u2019s\nfalsification occurred only once, he admitted his illegal drug usage, stopped using illegal drugs,\ndiscontinued ties with his drug-using friends, and developed a good work reputation for\ntrustworthiness and reliability.  Department Counsel persuasively argues that the evidence that\nApplicant stopped using marijuana in late 2004 and disassociated himself from drug-using friends\nin approximately 2003, while it assists in mitigating concerns about drug involvement under\nGuideline H, does little to inform an analysis of the security concerns brought on by Applicant\u2019s\nfalsifications.  The Judge\u2019s decision contains no explanation as to how the cessation of drug use and\nthe disassociation from drug users alleviated any factors that caused the untrustworthy behavior,\nespecially since the falsifications occurred well after the time frame when Applicant, by his own\nreckoning, ended the drug usage and the associations.  There is also no evidence in the record\nindicating that Applicant obtained any counseling in relation to his falsifications.  The Judge\u2019s\napplication of Mitigating Condition 17(d) is not sustainable.\nDepartment Counsel also asserts that the Judge\u2019s whole-person analysis is unsustainable\nbecause it runs contrary to, and is unsupported by, the totality of the record evidence.  A review of\nthe Judge\u2019s whole-person analysis reveals that the Judge weighed the deliberate falsification that\noccurred less than 16 months before the close of the record against favorable evidence that the Judge\nconcluded persuasively established that Applicant will not repeat the conduct in the future.  Some\nof the evidence cited by the Judge in support of this conclusion is the same evidence he cited in\nsupport of the application of Mitigating Condition 17(d)(ceasing marijuana use, ending troubling\nassociations, etc.).  Again, while these factors speak directly to mitigation of drug usage under\nGuideline H, they bear little relationship to the ultimate determination of Applicant\u2019s security\nworthiness in light of evidence of falsification under Guideline E.  Additionally, the Judge mentions\nApplicant\u2019s good employment record, character evidence from co-workers, and the paying off of\nexpensive, high-interest loans as evidence of Applicant\u2019s trustworthiness and reliability.  However,\nthe favorable evidence cited by the Judge is insufficient to overcome the government\u2019s concerns\nabout falsification in this case, especially in light of the fact that the record establishes that Applicant\nengaged in multiple acts of falsification, rather than one isolated instance.\n   \nConclusion\n       \n\n6\nConsidering the record evidence as a whole, Department Counsel has identified errors by the\nJudge which, taken in their entirety, warrant reversal of the Judge\u2019s favorable security clearance\ndecision.\nOrder\nThe decision of the Administrative Judge granting Applicant a security clearance is REVERSED.\nSigned: Jeffrey D.

Duffy, Esq. Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro se\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nMASON, Paul J., Administrative Judge:\nApplicant submitted his Security Clearance Application (SCA), on November 24,\n2006. On May 12, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a\nStatement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security concerns under drug use (Guideline H),\nand personal conduct (Guideline E). The action was taken pursuant to Executive Order\n10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as\namended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel\nSecurity Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the\nrevised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29,\n2005, and made effective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued on or after\nSeptember 1, 2006. \n \nApplicant\u2019s undated answer to the SOR was received on or about June 13, 2008.\nDOHA issued a notice of hearing on July 28, 2008, and the hearing was held on August\n14, 2008. At the hearing, three exhibits (GE 1 through GE 3) were admitted in evidence\nwithout objection to support the government\u2019s case. Applicant testified. After the\nhearing, Applicant submitted character evidence from a former supervisor and current\ncoworkers. On August 19 and August 22, 2008, the government indicated no objection\nSeptember 19, 2008\n\n2\nto these exhibits being admitted in evidence. Department DOHA obtained a copy of the\nhearing transcript on August 20, 2008. Based upon a review of the case file, pleadings,\nexhibits, and testimony, eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \nFINDINGS OF FACT\nThe SOR contains one allegation under the drug involvement guideline, and two\nallegations under the personal conduct guideline. Applicant admitted all allegations. \nApplicant is 27 years old, single, with no children. He graduated from high school\nin June 2000, and attended college for one semester. He has been working as a\nmaterial handler for his current employer since September 2005. He handles incoming\nshipping items, assists in x-raying items that are transported into and around the facility,\nand monitors items that leave the facility. He seeks a security clearance. \nDrug Involvement\nApplicant began using marijuana in 2001 when he was 19 years old. His\nmarijuana use ended in late 2004 or early 2005. He provided his marijuana history in\nanswers to interrogatories (GE 2, September 2006) and answers to interrogatories (GE\n3, October 2007) Curiosity and peer pressure were the two primary reasons he used the\ndrug about once a week either with friends or alone over a four-year period. He\noccasionally purchased $5.00 worth of the drug wrapped in cigarette papers. The\nlargest quantity he ever purchased was $10.00 worth wrapped in two sets of cigarette\npapers. Applicant never used any other illegal drug or misused any prescription drug. \nFear of testing positive after a job-related, random drug test was one of the\nreasons Applicant discontinued marijuana use. He also decided he did not want drug\nuse to be a part of his future. Finally, he realized he wanted more financial stability in his\nfuture. In recent years, he obtained several high-interest loans from money lending\nbusinesses (not banks) to help a relative pay attorney fees for an appeal of a personal\ninjury case.\nApplicant has not used marijuana or any other drug since late 2004 or early\n2005, and has no intention of using any drug in the future. He no longer associates with\nthose friends who used marijuana with him more than three years ago. \nPersonal Conduct\nOn November 24, 2006, Applicant certified that the information he provided in his\nsecurity clearance application (SCA) was true and made in good faith. (GE 1, SCA,\ncertification section located just ahead of Applicant\u2019s signature) Yet, in response to\nquestion 24 a., requiring information about drug use since the age of 16 or in the last 7\nyears, Applicant answered \u201cNo,\u201d even though he used marijuana about once a week\nbetween 2001 and late 2004 or early 2005. He initially characterized the omission as a\nmistake at the hearing. But, he knew he was hiding four years of marijuana use with his\n\n3\n\u201cNo\u201d answer to question 24 a. He answered \u201cNo\u201d to question 24 a. because he believed\nthat telling the truth would spoil his chances of receiving a security clearance. \nCharacter Evidence\nApplicant\u2019s supervisor for an unknown at his present employer wrote a character\nstatement indicating that Applicant is dependable and hardworking. Applicant submitted\na set of performance objectives for 2008. The exhibit does not show Applicant\u2019s\nperformance ratings for the past three years. In a character statement provided by the\nteam leader (who signed the 2008 performance objectives), she indicated she worked\nwith Applicant on a daily basis, and found him to be a team player that follows\ndirections. Over the past three years, Applicant has always demonstrated\nprofessionalism to the property officer, while two other coworkers, who have known\nApplicant for about nine months, recommend him for a position of trust. \nPOLICIES\nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are flexible rules of law. Recognizing the complexities of human\nbehavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the\nadjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s ultimate adjudicative goal is a fair,\nimpartial and common sense decision. According to the AG, the entire process is a\ncareful, thorough evaluation of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole person\nconcept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available, reliable information\nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2b.\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \n\n4\nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship\nis not restricted to normal duty hours. Rather, the relationship is an around-the-clock\nresponsibility between an applicant and the federal government. The government\nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to\nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk\nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified\ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation\nas to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information.\nDrug Involvement (DI)\nDrug Involvement casts doubt on a person\u2019s willingness to comply with security\nrules and regulations. \nPersonal Conduct (PC) \nProviding dishonest or incomplete information during a security investigation\ndemonstrates poor judgment. \nANALYSIS\nDrug Involvement (DI) \n24. The Concern. \u201cUse of an illegal drug or misuse of a prescription drug can raise\nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because it may\nimpair judgment and because it raises questions about a person\u2019s ability or willingness\nto comply with laws, rules or regulations.\u201d\nApplicant\u2019s drug involvement falls within the scope of DI disqualifying condition\n(DC) 25.a. (any drug abuse) and DI DC 24.c. (illegal drug possession, including\ncultivation, processing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of\ndrug paraphernalia) based on Applicant\u2019s marijuana use, purchase, and possession of\nmaterials to ingest the drug. Applicant used the drug on a weekly basis for more than\nfour years. He purchased the drug in $5.00 and $10.00 increments. It is reasonable to\nassume he liked the drug\u2019s effect as he occasionally used the drug by himself, or away\nfrom the influence of peers. Finally, he used drug paraphernalia (papers). \nThe first two DI mitigating conditions are potentially applicable to circumstances\nof this case. The passage of almost four years affords a sufficient basis to apply DI\nmitigating condition (MC) 26.a. (the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent,\nor happened under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt\non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment) in his favor. The\npassage of time coupled with Applicant\u2019s credible statements and testimony about\nchanging his life convince me that his past drug use will not recur. DI MC 26.b. ((1)\ndisassociation from drug-using associates and contacts, (3) an appropriate period of\n\n5\nabstinence) applies to Applicant\u2019s decision to sever his ties with his drug using friends,\ncombined with the passage of almost four years of abstinence. The DI guideline is\nresolved in Applicant\u2019s favor. \nPersonal Conduct (PC)\n15. The Concern. \u201cConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty,\nor unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions about an\nindividual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified information. Of\nspecial interest is any failure to provide truthful and candid answers during the security\nclearance process or any other failure to cooperate with the security clearance\nprocess.\u201d\nDeliberate as opposed to unintentional omissions of material information are\ncognizable under the PC guideline. Examples of unintentional omissions are those that\noccur through haste, oversight or misunderstanding the question. \nApplicant\u2019s deliberate falsification of his SCA in November 2006 falls within the\nambit of PC DC 16.a. (deliberate omission or falsification of relevant facts from any\npersonnel security questionnaire to determine security clearance eligibility or\ntrustworthiness) Based on Applicant\u2019s initial testimony at the hearing indicating the\nomission was a mistake, PC DC 16.b. (deliberately providing false or misleading\ninformation concerning relevant facts to an investigator or other official government\nrepresentative) could be applied to interpret Applicant\u2019s mistake explanation as really a\nsecond attempt to conceal his history of marijuana use. However, I do not believe\nApplicant was trying to conceal his marijuana use, given the detailed account he\nprovided of his marijuana history in GE 2, and GE 3, and the generally credible nature\nof Applicant\u2019s testimony. \nThere are four mitigating conditions (MC) that are potentially applicable to the\ncircumstances in this case. Those conditions are: PC MC 17.a. (the individual made\nprompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, concealment or falsification, before\nbeing confronted with the facts); PC MC 17.c. (the offense was so minor, or so much\ntime has passed, or the behavior is so infrequent, or it happened under such unique\ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s\nreliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment); and, PC MC 17.d. (the individual has\nacknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling to change the behavior or taken\nother positive steps to alleviate stressors, circumstances, or factors that caused\nuntrustworthy, unreliable or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely\nto recur). \nPC MC 17.a. is not applicable as Applicant did not make efforts to provide the full\nscope of his drug history until he was asked about his drug use by the investigator in\nSeptember 2006. However, PC MC 17.c. and PC MC 17.d. are applicable because\nApplicant\u2019s deliberate falsification occurred only once, even though the falsification\noccurred less than 16 months before the hearing. Within the last three and closer to four\n\n6\nyears, Applicant admitted the illegality of his drug use and stopped using marijuana, he\ndiscontinued his ties with his drug using friends, and developed a good work reputation\nbecause of his trustworthiness and reliability. The PC guideline is found for Applicant. \nWhole Person Concept (WPC)\nThe AG indicates the ultimate determination of whether to grant a security\nclearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful\nconsideration of the whole person concept. Nine general policy factors define the WPC.\nThey are: (1) the nature, extent and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances\nsurrounding the conduct to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and\nrecency of the conduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct;\n(5) extent to which the participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion,\nexploitation, or duress; and, (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nPeer pressure is a potent influence on most teenagers and young adults.\nHowever, Applicant continued to regularly use marijuana until he was 23. He purchased\nthe drug occasionally. Though he stopped using marijuana in late 2004 or early 2005,\nhe deliberately concealed his drug history from his SCA in November 2006. Weighing\nagainst the deliberate falsification that occurred less than 16 months ago is the\nfavorable evidence persuading me Applicant will not repeat this adverse conduct in the\nfuture. In late 2004 or early 2005, Applicant stopped using marijuana driven by a\nconcern for his future. He did not want to be caught by a drug test and potentially lose\nhis job. He stopped associating with drug users. The character evidence reflects he has\nestablished a good employment record since September 2005. His coworkers applaud\nhis professionalism and dependability. He has taken remedial action in paying off the\nexpensive, high-interest loans. Having weighed and balanced all the evidence,\nApplicant has met his ultimate burden of persuasion under the DI and PC guidelines. \nFORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1 (Drug Involvement, Guideline H): FOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a.\nFor Applicant\nParagraph 2 (Personal Conduct, Guideline E): FOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a.\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.b.\nFor Applicant\n\n7\nCONCLUSION\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is\nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \n                       \nPaul J. Mason\nAdministrative Judge\n",

O\u2019Brien, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro Se\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nLYNCH, Noreen A., Administrative Judge:\nApplicant submitted his Security Clearance Application (SF 86), on August 10,\n2006. On October 22, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA)\nissued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns under Guideline F\nfor Applicant. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding\nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of\nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review\nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative\nguidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective\nwithin the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n \nApplicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on November 15, 2002, and\nrequested a hearing before an Administrative Judge. DOHA received the request on\nJanuary 15, 2008. I received the case assignment on January 17, 2008. DOHA issued a\nnotice of hearing on January 28, 2008, and I convened the hearing as scheduled on\nFebruary 14, 2008. The government offered Exhibits (Ex.) 1 through 5 which were\nreceived without objection. Applicant testified on his own behalf and submitted Exhibits\nMarch 6, 2008\n\nApplicant\u2019s answer to SOR.\n1\nAE A and B.\n2\nGE 1 (Security Clearance Questionnaire, dated August 10, 2006 ).\n3\nTr. 21.\n4\nTr. 51.\n5\nTr. 28.\n6\nTr. 58.\n7\n2\nA and B, without objection. DOHA received the transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on\nFebruary 25, 2008. Based upon a review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and\ntestimony, eligibility for access to classified information is denied.\nFindings of Fact\nIn his Answer to the SOR, dated November 15, 2007, Applicant admitted the\nfactual allegations in \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.m, and 1.o, of the SOR. He denied the factual allegation\nin \u00b6 1.n of the SOR.  He provided additional information to support his request for\n1\neligibility for a security clearance.  \n2\nApplicant is a 46-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He graduated from\nhigh school in 1980 and attended college for several years. He is married with three\nadult children. He has worked for his current employer since 2004.3\nApplicant has been gainfully employed since 1987 except for a for a short period\nof time in 1997. He also was unemployed for six months in 2003. His wife does not\nwork. He has consistently advanced in his positions.4\nIn 2000, he purchased a home. In mid 2002, the house was foreclosed. Applicant\nwas not paying the mortgage because he did not know where to send the payments.\nApplicant\u2019s mortgage balance was approximately $77,000. The house was sold and\napproximately $35,000 was the balance owed.  He was told to contact the company so\n5\nthat his credit report would reflect the true amount. He did not follow up.   \n6\nApplicant and his wife have medical problems. He is under a physician\u2019s care for\nheart problems. He had a heart attack in 2001. He has to go frequently to have his\nblood checked because of a problem with his pituitary gland.  His wife is diabetic. He\nhas health insurance through his employer.7\nBeginning in November 2005, Applicant incurred medical bills from hospitals and\nphysicians. He recalls paying some of the bills but does not have records or recall which\nones he has paid.  He admitted just forgetting about some of them. He intends to get\nthem resolved. \n\nGE 3 (Credit Bureau Report for Applicant, dated August 2007).\n8\nTr.37.\n9\nTr. 23.\n10\nTr.46.\n11\nTr.43.\n12\nTr. 52.\n13\n3\nThe SOR alleges 15 delinquent debts. The total amount of debt is approximately\n$10,100.  Applicant acknowledged the debts except allegation 1.n for $1,562.  He is\n8\n9\nadamant that he has no idea about the company and has not heard of them. More than\nhalf the debts are from medical providers.\nApplicant admitted the collection account for a time share in allegation \u00b6 1.a for\n$4,652 was the result of an initial transaction he signed in 2001. He claimed that he\nchanged his mind about purchasing the vacation package. He asserts that he told the\nsalesman within the required period of time that he did not wish to pursue the deal.\nHowever, Applicant did not follow up. It is still on his credit report. He admits it was a\nmistake not to formally file any paperwork. He does not intend to pay it now.10\nThe delinquent debt listed in allegation \u00b6 1.b for $126 is the result of a telephone\naccount for his daughter. He did not realize that it was in his name. He has not made\nany attempt to pay it.11\nThe delinquent debts listed in allegations \u00b6 1.c for $120 and 1.d for $642 are for\nelectricity bills. He moved to another location and thought the bills had been paid. When\nhe learned about the debts during the investigation, he promised to pay the bills. He has\nnot done so.\nThe allegations in 1.e through 1.l are for medical providers. They total\napproximately $1,437. The accounts are from 2003 until the present. Applicant was\nconfused about the accounts. He knows he has paid medical bills over the years but he\nis not certain which accounts are paid. He intends to resolve the issue but has not\nreviewed his paperwork.12\nThe allegation in 1.m is for a credit collection account for $1,544 from 2002.\nApplicant has not paid the bill.13\nThe allegation in 1.n is for a charged off account in the amount of $1,562. As\nnoted above, Applicant does not recognize the name of the creditor. At the hearing he\ndid not think it should be listed on his credit report. He does not remember co-signing\n\nGE 2 (Response to Interrogatories, dated August 2007).\n14\nId.\n15\nTr.69.\n16\nAE B (Letter from Supervisor).\n17\n4\nany accounts for his wife or other family member.  He has not disputed the account. He\nwill not pay for it until he believes it is his account.14\nThe final allegation in 1.o is for failing to make payments on his home in 2002.\nThis is the foreclosure that is discussed above. He does not believe he should be\nresponsible for any balance owing on the account after foreclosure. He has no intention\nof contacting the company.\nApplicant\u2019s income increased from $40,000 in 2004 to $52,000 in 2007. He often\nworks overtime. During the recent past he has averaged $1,400 in overtime per month.\nHis current monthly net income is $3,046. After monthly expenses of $2,577.04, and\npayments on two other accounts, he has a net remainder of $32.06. He contributes to\nhis retirement fund through an automatic payroll deduction.15\nApplicant completed financial interrogatories in August 2007. At that time he\nacknowledged that he had overlooked the debts in SOR 1.g, 1.i. and 1.j. He promised to\npay them. \nApplicant has not received any financial counseling. He did not contact his\ncreditors to arrange any settlements or make even small payments on any of the\ndelinquent accounts. He does intend to take care of the medical bills when he can\nreview his papers and correctly identify the accounts.16\nApplicant is a valued employee with his current employer. He is one of the top\nperformers and proved himself a leader in the group. He trains other employees and\nreceived the highest rating possible during his last performance review. He has a strong\nsense of integrity and works well with his fellow employees.17\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching\n\n5\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2,\nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the\n\u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available, reliable\ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a\ndecision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of\nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \nAnalysis\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set\nout in AG & 18:      \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to\n\n6\nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended\nis at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under\nAG & 19(a), an Ainability or unwillingness to satisfy debts@ is potentially disqualifying.\nSimilarly under AG & 19(c), Aa history of not meeting financial obligations@ may raise\nsecurity concerns. Applicant accumulated delinquent debt and was unable to pay some\nobligations for a period of time. Credit reports confirm that he has not paid the medical\nbills or charged off collection accounts. He does not intend to pay the amount from the\nforeclosure because he does not believe he owes anything. The activity for the\ndelinquent debts ranges from 2002 until the present. The approximate amount of debt is\n$10,000. The evidence is sufficient to raise these potentially disqualifying conditions,\nrequiring a closer examination.\nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security\nconcerns arising from financial difficulties. Under AG \u00b6 20(a), the disqualifying condition\nmay be mitigated where Athe behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or\noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt\non the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.@ Applicant=s\nfinancial worries arose because he accumulated some delinquent debt due to his\nmedical problems. He also had a six month period of unemployment in 2003. While the\nunemployment may have precipitated the debt, the inquiry does not end at that point.\nThe Applicant\u2019s problems have been ongoing and he has not resolved the debts. His\ninaction after being employed raise concerns about his current reliability,\ntrustworthiness, and good judgment. This potentially mitigating condition does not apply.\nUnder AG & 20(b), it may be mitigating where Athe conditions that resulted in the\nfinancial problem were largely beyond the person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a\nbusiness downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation),\nand the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances.@ As noted above, some of\nthe financial problems arose from his medical bills. He did not act responsibly in\nidentifying and resolving these debts. I find this potentially mitigating condition is not a\nfactor for consideration in this case. \nEvidence that Athe person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem\nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control@\nis potentially mitigating under AG & 20(c). Similarly, AG & 20(d) applies where the\nevidence shows Athe individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or\notherwise resolve debts.@ Applicant has not received counseling and has not resolved\nthe delinquent debts, either by payment or settlement. He is now financially sound and\nprepared for future contingencies. I conclude these potentially mitigating conditions do\nnot apply.\nAG \u00b6 20(e) applies where the evidence shows \u201cthe individual has a reasonable\nbasis to dispute the legitimacy of the past due debt which is the cause of the problem\nand provides documented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides\n\n7\nevidence of actions to resolve the issue.\u201d In this case a credit bureau report confirms\nthree debts that Applicant disputes. He believes the time share transaction was\ncancelled in a timely fashion and should not appear on his credit report. However, he\nhas not provided any documentation. Nor has he contacted anyone about this recently.\nLikewise, he disputes a charged off credit account but has not formally done anything\nabout it. The foreclosure account balance remains and Applicant has done nothing to\nresolve the issue. I conclude this potentially mitigating condition does not apply.\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness\nof the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include\nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which participation\nis voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent\nbehavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure,\ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d\nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security\nclearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful\nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.       \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant and his wife both have\nhealth problems. He had a heart attack several years ago and is monitored by his\nphysician. This has created numerous medical bills. Although Applicant has been\ngainfully employed and has health insurance, he has not paid all the medical bills. He\ndid have a short time of unemployment as well in 2003. He accumulated debt due to\ncircumstances largely beyond his control. However, he did not act responsibly under the\ncircumstances. He is married and has three children. As a result, he has focused his\nattention on providing a stable domestic environment for his family.  However, he has\nnot taken affirmative action to pay or resolve most of the delinquent debts raising\nconcerns about his good judgment. Of course, the issue is not simply whether all his\ndebts are paidBit is whether his financial circumstances raise concerns about his fitness\nto hold a security clearance. Applicant has not resolved most of his delinquent debts\nand despite promises to do so, he has not. He has not met his burden of proof in this\ncase to overcome the government\u2019s case. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I\nconclude Applicant has not mitigated the security concerns arising from his financial\nconsiderations. \n\n8\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:- 1.o:\nAgainst Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.\n                                              \n_________________\nNOREEN A. LYNCH\nAdministrative Judge\n",

    "summary": "Findings of Fact After a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, and upon due consideration of that evidence, I make the following Findings of Fact: Applicant, 47 years old, has worked as a security officer for a defense contractor in State #1 from December 2004 to present.

DeLaney, Esquire, and James Duffy, Esquire \nDepartment Counsel \nFor Applicant:  Gregory Moohn, Personal Representative \n \n \n \n____________________ \n \nDecision \n____________________ \n \n \nBRAEMAN, Kathryn M., Administrative Judge: \n \nHistory of the Case \n \n            The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of \nReasons (SOR) to the Applicant on October 19, 2007. The SOR detailed reasons why \nthe Government could not make the preliminary positive finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for the \nApplicant.1 The SOR alleged specific concerns over Financial Considerations \n(Guideline F) in paragraph 1 based on the revised Adjudicative Guidelines2 issued on \nDecember 29, 2005, and implemented by the Department of Defense, to be effective \nSeptember 1, 2006.  As discussed below, clearanc\n \n     1 This procedure is required by Executive Order 10865, as amended, and Department of Defense \nDirective 5220.6, dated January 2, 1992 (Directive), as amended and revised.    \n     2 A copy of the revised Adjudicative Guidelines was sent with his Statement of Reasons (SOR). \nFebruary 21, 2008\n\n \n2 \n \n \nApplicant responded to these SOR allegations in a notarized Answer of \nNovember 6, 2007, where he admitted all nine of the allegations and requested a \nhearing.  \n \n            Department Counsel submitted a Ready to Proceed notice on November 29, \n2007.  Subsequently the case was assigned to me on December 6, 2007.  A Notice of \nHearing issued on December 18, 2007, set the matter for January 8, 2008.   \n \n            At the hearing Department Counsel offered four documents (Exhibits 1-4) that \nwere admitted into evidence without objection.  Applicant offered 17 documents \n(Exhibits A-Q) that were admitted into evidence without objection and testified himself.  \nAt his request, and as the Department Counsel did not object, we left the record open \nuntil January 22, 2008, in order for him to submit supplemental information.  Department \ncounsel was granted three days to review the submissions.  (TR 138, 151)  Applicant \ntimely submitted eight pages of records (Exhibit R); Department Counsel reviewed the \ndocuments and stated on January 18, 2008, that he had no objection to them being \nadmitted into evidence; and the record closed.  The transcript (TR) was received on \nJanuary 17, 2008. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n            After a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, and upon \ndue consideration of that evidence, I make the following Findings of Fact: \n \n Applicant, 47 years old, has worked as a security officer for a defense contractor \nin State #1 from December 2004 to present. Applicant completed a Security Clearance \nApplication (SF 86) to obtain a security clearance; he began the process in 2004 and \ncompleted the form in September 2006. Previously he worked for various companies as \na truck driver. In 2001 Applicant joined his wife\u2019s new company, but it was not \nsuccessful; it closed in 2003.  (Exhibit 1; TR 58-63, 65, 77-78; 108-109; Exhibit E)  In \n2004 his wife accepted a job in State #1; Applicant left their home in State #2 and joined \nher.  (TR 65-66; Exhibit E)  Applicant needs a security clearance as he is an officer in \nhis union.  (Exhibit K; TR 71; 79) \n \n Applicant served in the U.S. military from May 1977 to May 1986 and received \nawards; he attained the rank of staff sergeant (E6) in six years.  He then served in the \nArmy Reserves for one year.  (Exhibit 1; Exhibits E, G; TR 55-56, 69-70)   \n \nApplicant married in 1981 and has three children, a son born in 1981, and twins \nborn in 1985.  (Exhibit 1; TR 77-78)  Applicant earned his high school General \nEducational Development (GED) certificate in August 1982 (Exhibit H; TR 70-71) \n  \nFinances \n             \n Applicant did not check his credit reports before he completed his SF 86. \n(Exhibit E; TR 66-67; 105-109) He only disclosed on his SF 86 that he had a lien placed \n\n \n3 \n \n \nagainst his property in 2000 by the IRS; and in April 2004 he had a judgment of $10,000 \nplaced against him by a state.  He did not disclose any judgments or delinquent debts.  \n(Exhibit 1)  However, he later learned he did not have a tax lien on his property.  (TR \n133-136)  The security investigation included a credit report which listed his delinquent \ndebts and judgments.  (Exhibit 3) \n \nIn response to a Financial Interrogatory sent to him questioning him on the \ncurrent status of judgments, liens and debts, Applicant provided details in October 2007 \nof the status of each of these debts and which ones had been satisfied.  He reported \nthat he, his spouse and his daughter earned joint monthly net income of over $8,000, \nhad monthly expense of approximately $5,000, and made debt payments of almost \n$2,000.  He thus had a net remainder of approximately $1,000 per month.  He owns a \nhouse assessed at $109,000 in State #2 where they used to live.   He paid off debts \ntotaling almost $10,000 in the past year. (Exhibit 2; Exhibit N; TR 72)  His wife had a \nbusiness in State #2 which closed in 2003 where there was an outstanding promissory \nnote to a computer store, but they have paid that debt.  (Exhibit D; TR 53-54) \n \nIn addition to the medical expenses from his wife\u2019s injury, Applicant attributed his \nrecent financial problems in large part to his efforts to help his family who are a high \npriority for him.  From June 2006 to September 2007 he sent over $8,000 to one son, \nwho was discharged from the military, as he is maintaining the family house they own in \nState #2.  (Exhibit C; TR 53)  In January 2006 his daughter moved in and in September \n2006 his granddaughter was born; the daughter and her child remained with him until \nJanuary 2008.  Earlier his household bills included expenses for his daughter, her \nvehicles, and daycare.  A single parent, his daughter had not received child support \nfrom the child\u2019s father.  (Exhibit 2)  Recently, his daughter married the child\u2019s father and \nhas moved to State #3.  Applicant spent $2,000 for his daughter\u2019s wedding. (TR 67; \nExhibit E)  \n \nThus, in January 2008 he reported that he and his spouse earned monthly net \nincome of over $7,500, had monthly expenses of approximately $3,300, and made debt \npayments of over $1,800.  He thus has a net remainder of approximately $2,332 per \nmonth.  He retains his house assessed at $109,000 in State #2 plus other assets of \n$6,800.  (Those assets include a Timeshare obtained in 2005 which he is now trying to \nsell it to reduce his liabilities.)  He has made several changes to reduce their expenses \nand plans to move to a smaller apartment to reduce their rent. For example, Applicant \ndrives a 1990 vehicle with 272,000 miles on it. He no longer will have expenses for his \ndaughter and her child as they no longer live with him.  (Exhibit O; TR 72-74; 110-115; \n119-120; 135-136)  \n \n \nWhile Applicant and his wife each had a pay increase of 6.25% in September \n2007, in October 2007 his wife was in a car accident and their car was totaled.  They \nreplaced it with a less expensive used car.  They have used the settlement monies of \n$3,900 to resolve some of their debts.  (Exhibit 2; Exhibit E; TR 66-67; 116-117) \n \n\n \n4 \n \n \nApplicant has made progress in resolving these ongoing, delinquent debts as \nfollows:  \n \n\u2022 He owes $440 for a judgment to Creditor #1, a school, from 2005 for book \nfees for his children. However, he did not receive the notice as he had left \nState #2.  He first learned of the debt in his investigative interview in \nDecember 2006.  While he originally disputed this debt, now he has made \narrangements to make payments on this debt and has mailed the first \npayment. (SOR \u00b6 1.a.) (Answer; Exhibits 2, 3, 4; Exhibit R; TR 36-37; 80-\n84)   \n \n\u2022 He owes $449 for a judgment to Creditor #1, a school, from 2003 for book \nfees.  While he originally disputed this debt, now he has made \narrangements to make payments on this debt and has mailed the first \npayment. (SOR \u00b6 1.b.) (Answer; Exhibits 2, 3, 4;  Exhibit R; TR 38-39; 84-\n87)   \n \n\u2022 He owes $10,123 for a judgment to Creditor #2, a medical center, due to \nhis wife\u2019s medical emergency which resulted from a horse riding accident \nin April 2003.  While he initially believed he did have insurance because of \nhis seasonal work, later he learned he did not have insurance and also \nlearned that he was to be laid off from his job.  Thus, he had limited \nresources to resolve this debt.  Recently, he made arrangements to make \npayments on this debt of $200 per month and has made the first payment.  \nDue to interest at over 9%, the debt is now over $14,000 which he intends \nto resolve. (SOR \u00b6 1.c.) (Answer; Exhibits 2, 3, 4; Exhibits B, R; TR 40-41; \n63-64; 87-92)   \n \n\u2022 He owes $4,552 for a judgment to Creditor #2, a hospital, where he first \ntook his wife after her April 2003 accident.  The debt is now over $6,000 \nbecause of interest.  Recently, he has made arrangements to make $200 \nmonthly payments on this debt and has mailed the first payment. When he \ncan, he will make higher monthly payments to resolve this debt.  (SOR \u00b6 \n1.d.) (Answer; Exhibits 2, 3, 4; Exhibit B, R; TR 42-43; 63-64; 92-93)   \n \n\u2022 He owed $804 for a judgment to Creditor #3, a court. He first learned of \nthe debt in his investigative interview in December 2006.  He previously \npaid this debt in 2001, but the attorney for the hospital failed to file the \nsatisfaction of judgment with the court.  He recently contacted the court \nand the attorney\u2019s office who will now file the paperwork to resolve this \nmatter. (SOR \u00b6 1.e.) (Answer; Exhibits 2, 3, 4; Exhibit A; TR 43-44; 93-97)   \n \n\u2022 He owes $262 for a judgment to Creditor #4, a dentist, for treatment of his \noldest son in 2002.  Initially he made payments; however, he stopped \nmaking payments in 2003 when they had financial difficulties.  He \nsubsequently contacted the Creditor in September 2007 and has paid the \n\n \n5 \n \n \ndebt in full in 2008.  (SOR \u00b6 1.f.) (Answer; Exhibits 2, 3, 4;  Exhibit J; TR \n44-45; 97-103)  \n  \n\u2022 While he owes $75 to Creditor #5 for a beeper because of an early \ntermination fee, he cannot resolve this debt as the company is out of \nbusiness.  Thus, he cannot find the company to whom the debt is owed.  \n(SOR \u00b6 1.g.) (Answer; Exhibits 2, 3, 4; TR 46-47)   \n \n\u2022 He owes $222 to Creditor #6 for a charge to a store in 1995-96.  The \ncompany who collects for this credit card sold the debt to another \ncompany who could not identify the account, so he has been unable to \nresolve this debt.    (SOR \u00b6 1.h.) (Answer; Exhibits 2, 3, 4; TR 47-49; 103)   \n \n\u2022 He is 30 days past due in paying his mortgage for the house in State #2 \nand owes $831 to Creditor #7.  He has had the mortgage since 1996. His \ntwo sons now live in the house, but do not pay rent.  He says he is in good \nstanding despite the late payment and being one month behind.  (SOR \u00b6 \n1.i.) (Answer; Exhibits 2, 3, 4; TR 49-52; 104-105; 124-125)  The \nmortgage company confirmed that he was in good standing with them.  \n(Exhibit R) \n \nApplicant has no credit cards.  (TR 127)  He has established a budget but has \nnot had any credit counselor to assist him.  Because none of his debts are related to \ncredit card issues, he decided that consumer credit counseling agencies could not help \nhim.  It is his intent to resolve all of his debts.  (TR 127-130) \n \nReferences \n \n \nA union officer attested to Applicant\u2019s professional leadership demeanor and \nintegrity.  He reported that Applicant\u2019s work at all times exceeded requirements.  He is \nhonest, hardworking, and able to keep commitments.  (TR 71: Exhibit K) \n \n \nThe building manager where he has worked for two years stated that she has \nknown him for almost three years and that he is organized, efficient, and extremely \ncompetent.  He has excellent rapport with his peers.  She highly recommended him.  \n(Exhibit M; TR 72) \n \n            Applicant\u2019s two supervisors for 18 months evaluated favorably him.  (Exhibits P, \nQ) \nPolicies \n \n            Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines to consider in \nevaluating an individual's security eligibility which are divided into conditions that could \nraise a security concern and may be disqualifying and conditions that could mitigate \nsecurity concerns.  In deciding whether to grant or continue an individual's access to \nclassified information, the mere presence or absence of any adjudication policy \n\n \n6 \n \n \n                                                          \ncondition is not decisive.  Based on a consideration of the evidence as a whole in \nevaluating this case, I weighed the relevant Revised Adjudication Guidelines, and \ndetermined the following security concern was relevant to my determination: \n \nGuideline F:  Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern caused by financial problems is: \n \nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation.  \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds.  Compulsive gambling is a concern as it may lead to financial \ncrimes including espionage.  Affluence that cannot be explained by known \nsources of income is also a security concern.  It may indicate proceeds \nfrom financially profitable criminal acts. \n \nAG \u00b6 18. \n \n            The responsibility for producing evidence initially falls on the Government to \ndemonstrate that it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue \napplicant's access to classified information. Then the applicant may present evidence to \nrefute, explain, extenuate, or mitigate in order to overcome the doubts raised by the \nGovernment, and to demonstrate persuasively that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant or continue the clearance.  Under the provisions of Executive \nOrder 10865, as amended, and the Directive, a decision to grant or continue an \napplicant's security clearance may be made only after an affirmative finding that to do \nso is clearly consistent with the national interest. In reaching the fair and impartial \noverall common sense determination, the Administrative Judge may draw only those \ninferences and conclusions that have a reasonable and logical basis in the evidence of \nrecord.   \n \n            Section 7 of Executive Order 10865 specifically provides industrial security \nclearance decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a \ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d The decision to deny an \nindividual a security clearance is not a decision on the allegiance, loyalty, and patriotism \nof an applicant.3 An adverse decision reflects that an applicant has not met the strict \nguidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a \nsecurity clearance. \n \n \n \n \n     3Executive Order No. 10865 \u00a7 7. \n\n \n7 \n \n \nAnalysis \n \nFinancial Considerations \n      \n            The government provided substantial evidence of Applicant\u2019s financial problems \nreflecting medical and other debts totaling approximately $18,000.   Consequently, \nFinancial Considerations Disqualifying Condition, AG \u00b6 19(a), \u201cinability or unwillingness \nto satisfy debts,\u201d and AG \u00b6 19(c), \u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations,\u201d apply. \n His financial problems are sufficiently significant to raise security concerns. \n \n            With the government\u2019s case initially established, the burden shifted to Applicant \nto present evidence of refutation, extenuation, or mitigation to overcome the case \nagainst him.  \n \n  \nFive Financial Considerations Mitigating Conditions under AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a)-(e) are \npotentially applicable:  \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or \nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem \nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is \nunder control; \n \n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \notherwise resolve debts; and, \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \n \n  \nAG \u00b6 20(a) partially applies because several of his financial problems \u201coccurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the \nindividual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.\u201d His largest debts grew \nout of his wife\u2019s accident and consequent hospital expenses at a time where he neither \nhad insurance nor a permanent job. Recently, he has addressed his debts and has \nbegun to make payments to resolve all his debts.  He does not receive full credit under \n\n \n8 \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(a) because not all of his debts grew out of special circumstances and because \nof his slowness in addressing the alleged debts.   \n \nAG \u00b6 20(b) provides that security concerns may be mitigated when, \u201cthe \nconditions that resulted in the behavior were largely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., \nloss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, \ndivorce or separation) and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances.\u201d \nApplicant and his wife resolved a large unresolved debt from his wife\u2019s business failure \ndue to a business downturn in the post 9-11 climate.  Also, Applicant\u2019s wife\u2019s medical \ndebts of over $15,000 fall within this consideration of \u201clargely beyond\u201d his control. As his \nwife has income equivalent to his, one could logically attribute those debts solely to her \nand not hold him personally responsible for this substantial debt.  On the other hand, \nApplicant has made an arrangement with these health care providers to resolve these \nmedical debts from her accident from their joint income.  Also, Applicant has helped his \nson when he left the military service and his daughter who had a child to support as a \nsingle parent.  Now Applicant has demonstrated that he has reduced his expenses. Also \nwith his daughter married and moving to join her husband, he has more resources \navailable to use to settle these debts.  He receives partial credit under AG \u00b6 20(b) as \nnot all debts were from conditions beyond his control.   \n \nAG \u00b6 20(c) applies.  Although Applicant did not seek financial counseling, there \nare clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control as he has \ndeveloped a plan to resolve his debts.  One SOR debt was paid, but the judgment was \nnot released by the creditor; he has now resolved that issue.  He has negotiated \npayment plans with all the creditors he has been able to identify and contact.  While \nApplicant recently began to resolve these debts, he now has substantial additional \nresources.  He has also made substantial efforts to reduce his expenses. Thus, I \nconclude that he has responsibly demonstrated the problem is under control. \n \nAG \u00b6 20(d) applies because he recently \u201cinitiated a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.\u201d AG \u00b6 20(e) does not apply as Applicant \ndid not \u201cdispute the legitimacy of the past-due debt which is the cause of the problem.\u201d \n \nWhole Person Analysis \n \nApplicant\u2019s financial difficulties have almost entirely grown out of his exemplary \nefforts to help his family through difficult circumstances.  Both Applicant and his wife are \nfull time workers, who have a budget and a plan to resolve their debts despite all of the \ndifficult circumstances they have faced. Applicant has taken significant steps to move \nahead on the road to financial recovery. For example, he agreed to make monthly \npayments to resolve $15,000 of the $18,000 in debt that resulted from his wife\u2019s 2003 \naccident.  Having considered both the record and Applicant in light of the \u201cwhole \nperson\u201d concept, I conclude he is a sincere person who made substantial efforts to \nreform his financial practices.  There is little potential for pressure, coercion, \nexploitation, or duress because of his stable employment. His supervisors and the \n\n \n9 \n \n \nbuilding manager assess him as reliable and trustworthy; and they all attest to the \nquality of his current work  \n \nIn conclusion, financial issues no longer remain a security concern. After \nweighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions, and all the facts and circumstances \nin the context of the whole person, I conclude he has mitigated the security concerns \npertaining to financial considerations. I rule For Applicant in subparagraphs 1.a through \n1.i as he paid or developed and implemented a plan to resolve his judgments and other \ndebts.  \n \n            After reviewing the allegations of the SOR in the context of the Adjudicative \nGuidelines in Enclosure 2 and the factors set forth under the Adjudicative Process \nsection, I make the following formal findings: \n                                               \nFormal Findings \n \nParagraph 1. Guideline F:                                       FOR APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a. through 1.i.:                             For Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n            In light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for the \nApplicant.  Clearance is granted. \n \n \n \n___________________________ \nKathryn Moen Braeman \nAdministrative Judge \n",
