The Government included in the FORM a prominent notice advising Applicant of his right to object to the admissibility of Item 3 on the ground that it was not authenticated. Applicant was also notified that if he did not raise any objection to Item 3 in his response to the FORM, or if he did not respond to the FORM, he could be considered to have waived any such objection, and that Item 3 could be considered as evidence in his case.

Gregorian, Esq., Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro se \n11/06/2019 \n______________ \nDecision \nMARINE, Gina L., Administrative Judge: \nThis case involves security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial \nConsiderations). Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nStatement of the Case \n \nApplicant submitted a security clearance application (SCA) on September 7, \n2017. On April 10, 2019, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications Facility \n(DOD CAF) sent him a Statement of Reasons (SOR) alleging security concerns under \nGuideline F. The DOD CAF acted under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) implemented by \nthe DOD on June 8, 2017.  \nApplicant answered the SOR on July 17, 2019, and requested a decision on the \nwritten record without a hearing. On August 5, 2019, the Government sent Applicant a \ncomplete copy of its written case, a file of relevant material (FORM), including \ndocuments identified as Items 1 through 6. He was given an opportunity to submit a \ndocumentary response setting forth objections, rebuttal, extenuation, mitigation, or \nexplanation to the Government\u2019s evidence. He received the FORM on August 12, 2019, \n\n \n2 \n \nand did not respond. Item 1 contains the pleadings in the case. Items 2 through 6 are \nadmitted into evidence. The case was assigned to me on October 18, 2019. \n \nProcedural Matter \n \nI extracted the below findings of facts from Applicant\u2019s SOR Answer (Item 1), his \nSCA (Item 2), and a summary of his security clearance interview (SI) (Item 3). Item 3 \nwas not authenticated as required by Directive \u00b6 E3.1.20. However, I conclude that \nApplicant waived any objection to Item 3. The Government included in the FORM a \nprominent notice advising Applicant of his right to object to the admissibility of Item 3 on \nthe ground that it was not authenticated. Applicant was also notified that if he did not \nraise any objection to Item 3 in his response to the FORM, or if he did not respond to \nthe FORM, he could be considered to have waived any such objection, and that Item 3 \ncould be considered as evidence in his case. Applicant received the FORM, including a \ncopy of Item 3, but did not either respond to the FORM or otherwise object to Item 3. \n \nSOR Amendment \n \nPursuant to Directive \u00b6 E3.1.13, the Government amended the SOR to withdraw \nthe allegation in subparagraph 1.l in its entirety.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant, age 55, is unmarried without children. He has resided with a \ncohabitant since 2010. He earned a high school diploma in 1983. He has been \nemployed as a material coordinator by a defense contractor since August 2017. This is \nhis first application for a DOD security clearance. \n \nApplicant has 11 unresolved delinquent debts totaling $23,786, including 10 \nconsumer accounts (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a \u2013 1.e and 1.g \u2013  1.k) and a $2,140 federal student-loan \naccount (SOR \u00b6 1.f). Applicant claimed that he is making monthly payments for the \ndebts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a \u2013 1.e and 1.g \u2013 1.j. However, he did not specify any details \nabout how much or when he has made such payments. Applicant denied the debt \nalleged in SOR \u00b6 1.f, claiming it had been paid in full, and the debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.k, \nwithout explanation. He did not provide any documents to corroborate his claims. (Item \n1 at 4 \u2013 5; Items 4, 5, and 6). \n \nApplicant attributed the accumulation of the alleged debts (except SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a \u2013 \n1.c) to his unemployment, although he did not specify which period. He stated that he \nforgot to pay the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.b and 1.c and had no excuse for not paying \nthe debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.a. He was unemployed most recently between July 2016 \nand September 2016, after being fired. However, the credit reports reveal that Applicant \nfell behind on the most of his debts (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a \u2013 1.h and 1.j \u2013 1.k) between February \n2015 and May 2016, and one debt (SOR \u00b6 1.i) in October 2018. His prior periods of \nunemployment included: 1) October 2013 through March 2014, after a layoff; 2) January \n2012 through January 2013, after a layoff; and 3) July 2008 through September 2008, \nafter a layoff. (Item 2 at 9 \u2013 19 and 34; Item 3 at 2, and 4 \u2013 6; Items 4, 5, and 6). \n\n \n3 \n \nDuring his August 2018 SI, Applicant asserted that his finances had improved \nsince his most recent employment in August 2017 and that he was working towards \nresolving his delinquent debts. He stated that he was willing and able to repay all of his \ndebts and would never experience financial difficulties again. Between February 2018 \nand an unspecified date, Applicant paid 15% of his unspecified salary to resolve a \n$7,545 delinquent federal student-loan account (formerly SOR \u00b6 1.l, which was \nwithdrawn by the Government). However, the record did not otherwise specify any \ndetails about his relevant income and expense history. Applicant never utilized a debt \nconsolidation service, and there is no evidence in the record that he received financial \ncounseling. Applicant expressly chose to resolve his debts directly with his creditors \nrather than file for bankruptcy. (Item 1 at 5; Item 3 at 5) \n \nPolicies \n \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d (Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988)). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d (Egan at 527). \nThe President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant \napplicants eligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d (EO 10865 \u00a7 2). \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the AG. These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, \nrecognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge applies these \nguidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative \njudge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available and reliable information about the \nperson, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \n \n  \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d (EO 10865 \u00a7 \n7). Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \n \n \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in \nthe personal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant \nfrom being eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden \n\n \n4 \n \nof establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. (Egan, 484 U.S. at 531). \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d (See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994)). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the \ncriteria listed therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. ISCR Case No. 15-01253 at \n3 (App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2016). Once the Government establishes a disqualifying condition \nby substantial evidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate the facts. (Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15). An applicant has the burden of proving a \nmitigating condition, and the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. \n(ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005)). \n \n  \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d (ISCR Case No. \n01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002)). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should \nerr, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d (Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; AG \u00b6 2(b)). \n \nAnalysis \n \nThe security concern under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) is set out in \nAG \u00b6 18, as follows: \n \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds . . . .  \n \n \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified information to raise money. It encompasses concerns about a \nperson\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting classified \ninformation. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information. (ISCR \nCase No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012).  \n \nApplicant\u2019s 11 unresolved delinquent debts totaling $23,786, which were \ncorroborated by his admissions and credit reports, establish two disqualifying conditions \nunder this guideline: AG \u00b6 19(a) (inability to satisfy debts); and AG \u00b6 19(c) (a history of \nnot meeting financial obligations).  \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n5 \n \n \nNone of the following potentially applicable mitigating conditions under this \nguideline are fully established: \n \nAG \u00b6 20(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not \ncast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment;  \n \nAG \u00b6 20(b): the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were \nlargely beyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; and \n \nAG \u00b6 20(d): the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to \nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \n \n \nApplicant did not provide proof that he either paid or is making monthly payments \nto resolve any of the debts alleged in the SOR. While his periods of unemployment \nfollowing layoffs could be considered circumstances beyond his control, the record \nevidence lacks important details about the specific financial impact any such periods \nhad on the accrual of Applicant\u2019s delinquent debts and his ability to repay them. \nApplicant also failed to provide sufficient evidence to demonstrate that he has acted \nresponsibly to address his debts. While he is credited with paying in full a $7,545 federal \nstudent loan, he has substantial debts that remain unresolved. Thus, in light of the \nrecord before me, I cannot conclude that Applicant has mitigated the Guideline F \nconcerns at this time.  \n \nWhole-Person Analysis \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether the granting or continuing \nof national security eligibility is clearly consistent with the interests of national security \nmust be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful consideration of the \nadjudicative guidelines, each of which is to be evaluated in the context of the whole \nperson. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process factors \nlisted at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n\n \n6 \n \n \nI have incorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-person \nanalysis, and I have considered the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). After weighing the disqualifying \nand mitigating conditions under Guideline F, and evaluating all the evidence in the \ncontext of the whole person, I conclude that Applicant has not mitigated security \nconcerns raised by his delinquent debts. Accordingly, Applicant has not carried his \nburden of showing that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant him \neligibility for access to classified information. \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings on the allegations set forth in the amended SOR, as required by \nSection E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:   \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.k:  \nAgainst Applicant \n \nSubparagraph 1.l:  \n \nWithdrawn \n \nConclusion \n \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant \nApplicant eligibility for access to classified information. Clearance is denied. \n \n \nGina L. Marine \nAdministrative Judge \n",

Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \nStatement of the Case \n \nApplicant submitted a security clearance application on October 24, 2017. On April \n10, 2019, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications Facility (DOD CAF) \nsent her a Statement of Reasons (SOR) alleging security concerns under Guideline F. \nThe DOD CAF acted under Executive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, \nDefense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as \namended (Directive); and adjudicative guidelines (AG) implemented by the DOD on June \n8, 2017. \n \nApplicant timely  answered the SOR and elected to have her case decided on the \nwritten record in lieu of a hearing. Department Counsel submitted the Government\u2019s file \nof relevant material (FORM) on July 3, 2019. Applicant received the FORM on July 10, \n2019. The Government\u2019s evidence, included in the FORM and identified as Items 1 \n\n2 \n \nthrough 6, is admitted without objection. Applicant responded to the FORM with a packet \nof documents, which was marked as Item A, and admitted into the record without \nobjection. The case was assigned to me on August 26, 2019. Based on my review of the \ndocumentary evidence, I find that Applicant has  mitigated the financial concerns. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant is a 31-year-old employee for a federal contractor. She has never \nmarried and has no children. She is engaged to be married. She obtained her \nundergraduate degree in 2010, and received a graduate degree in 2014.  She has never \nheld a security clearance. She has been employed with her current employer since June \n2017. (Items 2,3) Applicant\u2019s new employment provides her with a steady income. She \nwatches her finances and hopes to buy a home. \n \nFinancial \n \n \nThe SOR alleges in 1.a-1.e, student loans accounts totaling $356,681. (Items 2,6)  \nApplicant admitted the debts listed on the SOR and provided explanations. She has no \nother delinquent debts. (Items 4,5 and 6) \n \n \nApplicant worked part time while attending undergraduate school. She earned $10 \nan hour, and during the summer, she worked as a teacher\u2019s assistant, earning $13 an \nhour. She had to obtain student loans to fund her education. When she graduated in \n2010, Applicant owed about $115,096. in student loan debts (without interest). (AX A)  \n \n \nApplicant explained that she has been in contact with student loan servicers since \n2010, and did not just begin addressing the student loan issues in 2019. (Response to \nFORM) In 2010, she started graduate school and her student loan was placed in \ndeferment. She contacted the other loan service providers to place her loans in \nforebearance. Applicant continued to work as a teacher assistant. This did not provide \nsufficient income to pay, and she has a difficult time finding a position in her field that paid \nmore money. \n \n \nIn addition, Applicant reports that one month after starting graduate school in 2010, \nshe was in a head-on motor vehicle accident. Her car was deemed a total loss. She also \nreceived permanent injuries  to her sternum and spine. Although this made it difficult, she \ncontinued to attend graduate school and work. Her savings were depleted after she  \npurchased the car that was totaled. She is still receiving medical treatment as a result of \nthe accident. (Answer to FORM) \n \n \nIn April 2011, Applicant was employed as a program assistant for a federal agency \nand received a salary of $34,489. Her student loans were still in deferment. She admits \nthat she borrowed $220,418 in student loans from 2010 to 2013. After completion of her \ngraduate degree, Applicant had a total debt of $220,418.90, plus varying interest rates of \n6 to 7 percent.  The loans were deferred until December 2014. She received a settlement \n($22,000) amount from the car accident described above in July 2014. Applicant  gave \n\n3 \n \nthe entire check to the university. (AX A, attachment 2). When Applicant graduated in \n2014, she worked for a federal agency and her student loan remained in deferment. She \nalso produced a 2014 letter that she wrote to her congressman asking for advice and help \nwith the student loan. (AX A) The university did not resolve the financial issue and added \na $5,021 fee. \n \n \nIn 2016, Applicant contacted the other loan servicing providers to place her student \nloans in forebearance or loan forgiveness because she could not afford to make a \npayment.  She also consolidated the student loans and asked for an income-driven \nrepayment plan. (AX A, attachment 4) She stated that the loans were consolidated and \nshe made a total of $1,400 in payments in 2017 and 2018. (AX A, attachment 5) She had \nsome family problems in 2018 as well and financially  helped her father and her brother.   \n \n \nIn 2019, Applicant negotiated a settlement of her student loans at SOR 1.b-1.e. \n(AX A, attachments 5 and 6) She settled the student loans for a total of $14,200. She \nprovided documentation of payments made from April through July 2019 for a total of \n$1,790. (AX A, attachment 6) \n \n \nOn May 1, 2019, Applicant applied for a loan-rehabilitation program. She is now \npaying $5 a month. She had made four payments at the time of her answer to the FORM. \nWith this loan-rehabilitation program, Applicant will finish payments in 2023. She is \ncurrent with her payments. (AX A, attachment 7) \n \n \nAs to SOR allegation 1.a, Applicant admitted that she owed the collection account \nin the approximate amount of $203,504. She submitted documentation with her response \nto FORM that she is now in a loan-rehabilitation program for which she has qualified. (AX \nA, enclosure 4) She is making payments of $5 a month. \n \n \nAs to SOR 1.b.-1.e, Applicant provided documentation that she had made \npayments in 2017 and 2018, as stated above,  and negotiated a settlement in the amount \nof $14,200. She is current on her payments.  Thus far, she has made a total of $1,790 in \npayments.

An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \n \n \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \n\u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \n \n \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 92-1106 at 3, \n1993 WL 545051 at *3 (App. Bd. Oct. 7, 1993).   \n \n \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, \nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-\n31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).  \n \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-\n20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n5 \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F (Financial Considerations) \n \nThe concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \n \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds . . . .  \n \n \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified information to raise money. It encompasses concerns about a \nperson\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting classified \ninformation. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information. See ISCR \nCase No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s admissions, corroborated by her credit reports, and inability or failure \nto pay her delinquent student loans raises two disqualifying conditions under this \nguideline: AG \u00b6 19(a) (\u201cinability to satisfy debts\u201d); and AG \u00b6 19(c) (\u201ca history of not meeting \nfinancial obligations\u201d). \n \n \nThe security concerns raised in the SOR may be mitigated by any of the following \npotentially applicable factors: \n \nAG \u00b6 20(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not \ncast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \nAG \u00b6 20(b): the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \nAG \u00b6 20(c): the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling \nfor the problem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit \ncredit counseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem \n\n6 \n \nis being resolved or is under control.  \n \nAG \u00b6 20(d): the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to \nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n \nAG \u00b6 20 (e): the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy \nof the past-due debt which is the cause of  the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the debt. \n \n \nApplicant provided documentation that she has been addressing her student loans \nin many ways since 2010.  She had deferments and in 2014, when she received a check \ndue to the motor vehicle accident, she gave the entire check to the university.  She \nprovided documentation that she continued her good-faith efforts with various payments \nin 2017 and 2018. She did not neglect the student loans. She consolidated the loans in \n2016. Finally, she managed to negotiate a settlement of the $218,406 lotal student loans \n(SOR 1.b-1.e) for $14,200. She is making payments and is current. She has a new \nposition. She has made strides through her family and financial difficulties and has not \nneglected the student loans. She has no other delinquent debts. She submitted specific \ninformation about payments she has made.  Applicant has furnished sufficient information \nto meet her burden. The five listed mitigating conditions apply. \n \n \n \n \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-\nperson concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process \nfactors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \n \nApplicant is 31 years old. She attended undergraduate and graduate school so \nthat she could have good employment opportunities. She could not afford her education \nwithout student loans. She worked part time during undergraduate school and full time \nduring her graduate classes. The jobs were low-paying ones. She has addressed her \nstudent loans since 2010. She also helped her father and brother who were in financial \n\n7 \n \ndifficulty. She suffered injuries from a motor vehicle collision in 2010, and is still receiving \nmedical treatment for her injuries. She had no savings left at that point in time.  When she \nreceived a check in July 2014 from the insurance for the collision, she gave the entire \namount of the check ($22,000) to the university. She sought help from her congressman \nin 2013. She has made student-loan payments under different plans and is now in a \nstudent loan-rehabilitation program and has settled the other student loans for $14,000. \nApplicant provided proof of payments that she has made throughout the years. She acted \nresponsibly under the circumstances. She did not neglect her student loans. She has no \nother delinquent debts. Circumstances beyond her control adversely affected her \nfinances, and she acted reasonably and responsibly to address her delinquent debts. She \ntook action and addressed her student loans.  \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F (Financial Considerations): FOR APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.e: \n \n \n \nFor Applicant: \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nI conclude that it is clearly consistent with the national security interests of the \nUnited States to grant Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.

Eligibility for \naccess to classified information is denied. \nStatement of Case \nOn April 12, 2019, the Department of Defense (DoD) Consolidated Adjudications \nFacility (CAF) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing reasons why DoD \nadjudicators could not make the affirmative determination of eligibility for a security \nclearance, and recommended referral to an administrative judge to determine whether a \nsecurity clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked. The action was \ntaken under Executive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information \nWithin Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DoD Directive 5220.6, Defense \nIndustrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as \namended (Directive); and Security Executive Agent, Directive 4, National Adjudicative \nGuidelines (SEAD 4), effective June 8, 2017. \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant responded to the SOR on May 19, 2019, and elected to have his case \ndecided on the basis of the written record. Applicant received the File of Relevant \nMaterial (FORM) on June 26, 2019, and interposed no objections to the materials in the \nFORM. He timely supplemented the record with a written explanation of his debts with an \nattached printout of payments made and payments to be made through his debt relief \nfirm.  Applicant\u2019s post-FORM submissions were admitted without objection as Items 11-\n13.  The case was assigned to me on August 8, 2019. \nSummary of Pleadings \nUnder Guideline F, Applicant allegedly (a) failed to file his state income taxes for \ntax years 2010 through 2016 and (b) accumulated seven delinquent debts exceeding \n$48,000. (Item 1) Allegedly, his accrued delinquent state tax filing lapses and delinquent \ndebts remain unresolved and outstanding. \nIn his response to the SOR, Applicant admitted the allegations with explanations. \nHe claimed he experienced financial hardships: losing his job, house, and fianc\u00e9, facing \nunemployment for six months, and having to help his son who was diagnosed with \ncancer. Applicant expressed shame for the neglect he exhibited in handling his SOR \u00b6 1.a \ndebt. He claimed his morals, values, ethics, and integrity remain unbroken. And, he \nclaimed he is now financially stable and is working to resolve the SOR \u00b6 1.a debt \nFinding   s    of Fact \nApplicant is a 67-year-old technical staff employee for a defense contractor who \nseeks a security clearance. The allegations covered in the SOR and admitted by \nApplicant are incorporated and adopted as relevant and material findings. Additional \nfindings follow. \nBackground \nApplicant married in April 1982 and has two grown children from this marriage. \n(Item 3) He earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in engineering from an accredited college in June \n1987. (Item 7) He reported no military service. \nSince January 2018, Applicant has worked for his current defense contractor. (Item \n3) Between March 1992 and May 2017, he worked for other employers as a software \nengineer. He reported periods of unemployment between May 2015 and April 2016, and \nbetween May 2017 and January 2018. (Item 3) \nApplicant\u2019s finances \nApplicant failed to file his state income tax returns for tax years 2010-2016. (Items \n7-10) He attributed his filing failures to misunderstandings over whether he needed to file \nthe returns in issue when he had regularly received refunds for the prior years. (Item 7) \nHe figured that it was not worth his time to pursue the refunds that were relatively small. \nHe settled on letting the state have the extra money, and foregoing filing tax returns. (Item \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                \n       \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n7) Applicant provided no legitimate reasons for his failing to file his state tax returns for \nthe 2010-2016 years in question. To date, he has made no documented efforts to file his \nback tax returns for these tax years. \nDuring periods of unemployment and struggles with his finances, Applicant \ndefaulted on a number of his consumer accounts. His credit reports reveal that he \naccumulated delinquent accounts exceeding $48,000 between 2014 and 2017. (Items 4-\n5) Reported delinquent debts are comprised of the following: \u00b6\u00b6 1.b (16,419); 1.c \n($9,600); 1d ($6,331); 1.e ($5,819); 1.f ($3,036); 1.g ($1,021); and 1.h ($6,511). (Items 4-\n7) \nRecords confirm that Applicant took no actions to address his delinquent debts \nuntil November 2019. (Item 2) At this time, he completed a debt negotiation agreement \nwith a debt relief firm and included all of his listed delinquent debts. (Item 2) Payment \nterms of the agreement called for monthly payments of $680. (Item 2) He has made \nseven monthly payments to date and appears to be up-to-date on his payments to his \ndebt relief firm. (Item 2) \nPolicies \nThe SEAD 4, App. A lists guidelines to be used by administrative judges in the \ndecision-making process covering security clearance cases. These guidelines take into \naccount factors that could create a potential conflict of interest for the individual applicant, \nas well as considerations that could affect the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and \nability to protect classified information. These guidelines include conditions that could \nraise a security concern and may be disqualifying (disqualifying conditions), if any, and \nmany of the conditions that could mitigate security concerns. These guidelines must be \nconsidered before deciding whether or not a security clearance should be granted, \ncontinued, or denied. The guidelines do not require administrative judges to place \nexclusive reliance on the enumerated disqualifying and mitigating conditions in the \nguidelines in arriving at a decision. Each of the guidelines is to be evaluated in the context \nof the whole person in accordance with App. A. AG \u00b6 2\u00a9. \nIn addition to the relevant AGs, administrative judges must take into account the \npertinent considerations for assessing extenuation and mitigation set forth in App. A, AG \n\u00b6 2(d) of the AGs, which are intended to assist the judges in reaching a fair and impartial \ncommonsense decision based upon a careful consideration of the pertinent guidelines \nwithin the context of the whole person. \nThe adjudicative process is designed to examine a sufficient period of an \napplicant\u2019s life to enable predictive judgments to be made about whether the applicant is \nan acceptable security risk. The following App A, AG \u00b6 2(d) factors are pertinent: (1) the \nnature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the \nconduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the \nconduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n       \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \npermanent behavioral chances; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for \npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or \nrecurrence. \nViewing the issues raised and evidence as a whole, the following individual \nguidelines are pertinent in this case: \nFinancial Considerations \nThe Concern: Failure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy \ndebts and meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of \njudgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which \ncan raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and \nability to protect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can \nalso be caused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, \nother issues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, \nmental health conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse of \ndependence. An individual who is financially overextended is at greater \nrisk of having to engage in illegal acts or otherwise questionable acts to \ngenerate funds. . . .  AG \u00b6 18. \nBurden of Proof \nBy virtue of the principles and policies framed by the AGs, a decision to grant or \ncontinue an applicant's security clearance may be made only upon a threshold finding \nthat to do so is clearly consistent with the national interest. Because the Directive \nrequires administrative judges to make a commonsense appraisal of the evidence \naccumulated in the record, the ultimate determination of an applicant's eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance depends, in large part, on the relevance and materiality of that \nevidence. See United States, v. Gaudin, 515 U.S. 506, 509-511 (1995). \nAs with all adversarial proceedings, the judge may draw only those inferences \nwhich have a reasonable and logical basis from the evidence of record.  Conversely, the \njudge cannot draw factual inferences that are grounded on speculation or conjecture. \nThe Government's initial burden is twofold: (1) it must prove by substantial \nevidence any controverted facts alleged in the SOR, and (2) it must demonstrate that \nthe facts proven have a material bearing to the applicant's eligibility to obtain or maintain \na security clearance. The required materiality showing, however, does not require the \nGovernment to affirmatively demonstrate that the applicant has actually mishandled or \nabused classified information before it can deny or revoke a security clearance. Rather, \nthe judge must consider and weigh the cognizable risks that an applicant may \ndeliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nOnce the Government meets its initial burden of proof of establishing admitted or \ncontroverted facts, the evidentiary burden shifts to the applicant for the purpose of \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nestablishing his or her security worthiness through evidence of refutation, extenuation, \nor mitigation.  Based on the requirement of Exec. Or. 10865 that all security clearances \nbe clearly consistent with the national interest, the applicant has the ultimate burden of \ndemonstrating his or her clearance eligibility. \u201c[S]ecurity-clearance determinations \nshould err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d See Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988). \nAnalysis  \nSecurity concerns are raised over (a) Applicant\u2019s failure to file state tax returns \nfor tax years 2010-2016, as required by state law and (b) accumulation of over $53,000 \nof delinquent debts that he had previously failed to address. Applicant\u2019s history of \nfinancial difficulties warrant the application of three of the disqualifying conditions (DC) \nof the Guidelines: DC \u00b6\u00b6 19(a), \u201cinability to satisfy debts\u201d; 19\u00a9, \u201ca history of not meeting \nfinancial obligations\u201d\u201c; and 19(f), \u201cfailure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, \nstate, or local income tax as required,\u201d apply to the facts of Applicant\u2019s case. \nApplicant\u2019s admitted tax-filing lapses and delinquent debt negate the need for \nany independent proof. See Directive 5220.6 at E3.1.14; McCormick on Evidence, \u00a7 \n262 (6th ed. 2006). Each of Applicant\u2019s admitted debts is fully documented and creates \nsome judgment issues. See ISCR Case 03-01059 at 3 (App. Bd. Sept. 24, 2004). \nFinancial stability in a person cleared to protect classified information is required \nprecisely to inspire trust and confidence in the holder of a security clearance that \nentitles him to access classified information. While the principal concern of a security \nclearance holder\u2019s demonstrated financial difficulties is vulnerability to coercion and \ninfluence, judgment and trust concerns are implicit in cases involving tax filing failures \nand debt delinquencies.  \nHistorically, the timing of addressing and resolving tax filing issues and debt \ndelinquencies are critical to an assessment of an applicant\u2019s trustworthiness, reliability, \nand good judgment in following rules and guidelines necessary for those seeking \naccess to classified information or to holding a sensitive position. See ISCR Case No. \n14-06808 at 3 (App. Bd. Nov. 23, 2016); ISCR Case No. 14-01894 at 5 (App. Bd. Aug. \n18, 2015). Applicant\u2019s cited circumstances (assumed tax refunds and recurrent periods \nof unemployment) provide some extenuating benefit. MC \u00b6 20(b), \u201cthe conditions that \nresulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of \nemployment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce \nor separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances,\u201d has some \napplication  to Applicant\u2019s debt situation. \nBecause Applicant\u2019s efforts to address his delinquent debts have only been \nrecently initiated with modest repayment efforts to date, only partial extenuating credit \ncan be accorded his most recent repayment efforts. And, MC \u00b6 20(b) is not available at \nall to extenuate Applicant\u2019s collective failures to file his state tax returns for tax years \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                         \n2010-2016. Assumed refunds and unemployment issues are not justification for his \nfailure to file his state tax returns as required by his state\u2019s tax laws. \nTo his credit, Applicant has made some manifest progress in addressing his \ndelinquent debts through the debt relief program he has enrolled in. While modest to \ndate, he has made the monthly payments he committed to with his debt relief \nnegotiator. His efforts entitle him to partial application of MC \u00b6 20(d), \u201cthe individual \ninitiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay his creditors or otherwise resolve \nhis debts.\u201d Counseling benefits from his debt relief program are unclear and appear to \nbe too minimal in scope to warrant any application of MC \u00b6 20(c). \nIn evaluating Guideline F cases, the Appeal Board has stressed the importance \nof a \u201cmeaningful track record\u201d that includes evidence of tax filing and actual debt \nreduction through voluntary payment of debts, and implicitly where applicable the timely \nresolution of delinquent debts. ISCR Case No. 07-06482 at 2-3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008) \nIn Applicant\u2019s case, he has failed to date to initiate any efforts to address his state taxes \nand has taken only recent steps to address his accrued debts with a modest repayment \nplan that is still to early in follow-through to create the basis for implying a solid track \nrecord in Applicant\u2019s favor. His limited efforts to date, when considered together, are \ninsufficient to enable him to achieve favorable findings and conclusions with respect to \nraised security concerns over the state of his finances. \nWhole-Person Assessment \nWhole-person assessment is unfavorable to Applicant. He has shown insufficient \nprogress to date in addressing his state taxes and delinquent debts to merit enough \npositive credit to mitigate financial concerns. Overall, Applicant\u2019s actions to date in \naddressing his state taxes and delinquent debts reflect insufficient evidence of restored \nfinancial responsibility and judgment to overcome reasonable doubts about his \ntrustworthiness, reliability, and ability to protect classified information. See AG \u00b6 18. \nConclusions are warranted that his finances are insufficiently stabilized at this \ntime to meet minimum eligibility requirements for holding a security clearance. Eligibility \nto hold a security clearance under the facts and circumstances of this case is \ninconsistent with the national interest. \nFormal Findings \nIn reviewing the allegations of the SOR and ensuing conclusions reached in the \ncontext of the findings of fact, conclusions, conditions, and the factors listed above, I \nmake the following formal findings: \nGUIDELINE F (FINANCIAL CONSIDERATIONS): AGAINST APPLICANT\n  Subparagraph 1.a-1.h:\n   Against Applicant \n6 \n\n                                                                       Conclusions \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                          \n                                        \nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility to \nhold a security clearance.

Hayes, Esquire, Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro se \n11/15/2019\n______________ \nDecision \n______________ \nGALES, Robert Robinson, Administrative Judge: \nApplicant failed to mitigate the security concerns regarding financial considerations \nand personal conduct. Eligibility for a security clearance is denied. \nStatement of the Case \nOn July 11, 2017, Applicant applied for a security clearance and submitted a \nQuestionnaire for National Security Positions (SF 86). On December 17, 2018, the \nDepartment of Defense (DOD) Consolidated Adjudications Facility (CAF) issued him a \nset of interrogatories. He responded to those interrogatories on March 13, 2019. On May \n9, 2019, the DOD CAF issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to him, under Executive \nOrder (Exec. Or.) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February \n20, 1960), as amended and modified; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial \nPersonnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended and \nmodified (Directive); and Directive 4 of the Security Executive Agent (SEAD 4), National \nSecurity Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) (December 10, 2016), for all covered individuals \nwho require initial or continued eligibility for access to classified information or eligibility \nto hold a sensitive position, effective June 8, 2017. \n\n \n2 \n                                      \n \nThe SOR alleged security concerns under Guidelines F (Financial Considerations) \nand E (Personal Conduct), and detailed reasons why the DOD adjudicators were unable \nto find that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security \nclearance for Applicant. The SOR recommended referral to an administrative judge to \ndetermine whether a clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked.  \n \n \nIn a sworn statement dated July 15, 2019, Applicant responded to the SOR, and \nhe elected to have his case decided on the written record in lieu of a hearing. A complete \ncopy of the Government\u2019s file of relevant material (FORM) was mailed to Applicant by the \nDefense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) on August 16, 2019, and he was \nafforded an opportunity after receipt of the FORM to file objections and submit material in \nrefutation, extenuation, or mitigation. In addition to the FORM, Applicant was furnished a \ncopy of the Directive as well as the Adjudicative Guidelines applicable to his case. \nApplicant received the FORM on August 27, 2019. His response was due on September \n26, 2019. Applicant did not submit any response to the FORM. The case was assigned \nto me on October 28, 2019.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nIn his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted, without comments, all of the factual \nallegations pertaining to financial considerations (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a. through 1.c.), and personal \nconduct (SOR \u00b6 1.a.). Applicant\u2019s admissions are incorporated herein as findings of fact. \nAfter a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, and upon due \nconsideration of same, I make the following additional findings of fact:  \n \nBackground \n \nApplicant is a 30-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has been serving \nas a security guard with his current employer since June 2017. He is also a volunteer \nfirefighter captain. He is a 2008 high school graduate, and received an associate\u2019s degree \nin 2010. He was commissioned into either the Army National Guard (ANG) or the Active \nArmy Reserve, and he served from October 2010 until September 2014 when he was \nhonorably discharged as a second lieutenant. (Item 2, at 14-17; Item 3, at 4) He was \ngranted a secret clearance on an unspecified date. He was married in 2014, and divorced \nin 2016. He has no children.  \n \nFinancial Considerations \n \nGeneral source information pertaining to the financial accounts discussed below \ncan be found in the following exhibits: Item 5 (Combined Experian, TransUnion, and \nEquifax Credit Report, dated August 11, 2017); Item 6 (Equifax Credit Report, dated \nDecember 4, 2018); Item 3 (Enhanced Subject Interview, dated May 2, 2018); and Item \n1 (Applicant\u2019s Answer to SOR, dated July 15, 2019).  \nApplicant reported that he had been unemployed following his discharge from \nmilitary service, and that period of unemployment extended from October 2010 until \nSeptember 2014. He was also unemployed from April 2017 until June 2017. During both \n\n \n3 \n                                      \n \nperiods of unemployment, he was supported by his parents, and he spent his time \nsearching for a job. (Item 3, at 3-4) Several accounts became delinquent. During his \ninterview with an investigator from the U.S. Office of Personnel Management (OPM) in \nMay 2018, Applicant was questioned about his finances, and it was only after he was \nconfronted with negative financial information from his credit report that he did \nacknowledge having delinquent accounts. He attributed his financial difficulties to his \nunemployment. He stated that he would obtain a copy of his credit report and immediately \ncontact his creditors to bring all of his delinquent accounts into a current status. (Item 3, \nat 5-6)  \nThe SOR alleged three delinquent accounts totaling approximately $22,572. \nThose three accounts were an unsecured consumer loan with an unpaid balance of \n$21,451 for which $21,811 was charged off in February 2013 (Item 5, at 4; Item 6, at 1; \nand Item 3, at 6) (SOR \u00b6 1.a.); a medical account with an unpaid balance of $442 (Item \n5, at 11; Item 6, at 2; and Item 3, at 5) (SOR \u00b6 1.b.); and a medical account with an unpaid \nbalance of $679 (Item 5, at 10; and Item 3, at 6) (SOR \u00b6 1.c.). Although Applicant stated \nhis intention to resolve his delinquent accounts in May 2018 \u2013 over one year ago \u2013 he \nfailed to submit documentation such as correspondence with his creditors, cancelled \nchecks or money orders, or receipts to reflect that he had either contacted his creditors, \nor made payments to them in an effort to resolve his delinquent accounts. Instead, \nApplicant submitted selected screen shots of what he characterized as his credit report \non March 12, 2019, reflecting a credit score of 531; tax-reported income of $31,000; and \nzero total debt. (Item 4 \u2013 attachments to response to interrogatories) His submission did \nnot address the specific accounts alleged in the SOR. Furthermore, Applicant did not \nclaim that he had paid off the accounts in question. In the absence of more specific \ndocumentation associated with the specific accounts alleged in the SOR, I conclude that \nthe accounts are not yet in the process of being resolved. \nIt is not known what Applicant\u2019s current financial resources may be because he did \nnot report his current net monthly income; monthly expenses; and any monthly remainder \nthat might be available for discretionary spending or savings. There is no evidence of a \nbudget. There is no evidence of financial counseling. In the absence of additional financial \ninformation, it remains difficult to determine if Applicant is currently in a better position \nfinancially than he had been.  \nPersonal Conduct \nOn July 11, 2017, when Applicant completed his SF 86, he responded to certain \nquestions pertaining to his financial record found in Section 26. Some of those questions \nasked if, in the past seven years, he had defaulted on any type of loan; had bills or debts \nturned over to a collection agency; had any account or credit card suspended, charged \noff, or cancelled for failing to pay as agreed; and been over 120 days delinquent on any \ndebt not previously entered; as well as if he is currently over 120 days delinquent on any \ndebt? Applicant answered \u201cno\u201d to all of those questions, and certified that his responses \nwere \u201ctrue, complete, and correct\u201d to the best of his knowledge and belief. (Item 2, at 35-\n36) In fact, his answers were incorrect, for Applicant actually had delinquent accounts \n\n \n4 \n                                      \n \nthat clearly came within the scope of the questions asked. In his Answer to the SOR, \nApplicant admitted that he had deliberately falsified the material facts in his responses to \nthe SF 86 inquiries. (Item 1, at 2) \n \nPolicies \n \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the Executive \nBranch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security emphasizing, \n\u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d (Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. \n518, 528 (1988)) As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to control \naccess to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual \nis sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information. The President has \nauthorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant an applicant eligibility for \naccess to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to do so.\u201d (Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \nIndustry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified.)     \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the guidelines in SEAD 4. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the guidelines list potentially disqualifying \nconditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility \nfor access to classified information. \n \nAn administrative judge need not view the guidelines as inflexible, ironclad rules \nof law. Instead, acknowledging the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. The entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known \nas the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a meaningful decision. \n \nIn the decision-making process, facts must be established by \u201csubstantial \nevidence.\u201d \u201cSubstantial evidence [is] such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might \naccept as adequate to support a conclusion in light of all contrary evidence in the record.\u201d  \n(ISCR Case No. 04-11463 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2006) (citing Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1))  \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d  (See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994)) \n \nThe Government initially has the burden of producing evidence to establish a \npotentially disqualifying condition under the Directive, and has the burden of establishing \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Once the Government has produced substantial \nevidence of a disqualifying condition, under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant has the \nburden of persuasion to present evidence in refutation, explanation, extenuation or \nmitigation, sufficient to overcome the doubts raised by the Government\u2019s case. The \nburden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government. (See ISCR \nCase No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005)) \n\n \n5 \n                                      \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours as well. It is \nbecause of this special relationship that the Government must be able to repose a high \ndegree of trust and confidence in those individuals to whom it grants access to classified \ninformation. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the \napplicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. Such \ndecisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather \nthan actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Furthermore, \u201csecurity clearance \ndeterminations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d (Egan, 484 U.S. at 531) \n \nClearance decisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense \nbe a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d (See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 \n7) Thus, nothing in this decision should be construed to suggest that I have based this \ndecision, in whole or in part, on any express or implied determination as to Applicant\u2019s \nallegiance, loyalty, or patriotism. It is merely an indication the Applicant has or has not \nmet the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for \nissuing a clearance.  In reaching this decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that \nare reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I \nhave avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG \u00b6 18:  \n      \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19:  \n \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n\n \n6 \n                                      \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations.  \n \nThe SOR alleged three delinquent accounts totaling approximately $22,572. \nApplicant admitted that the debts were his responsibility, and that as of the date the SOR \nwas issued, the accounts were still delinquent. AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and 19(c) have been \nestablished.  \n \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns arising from financial difficulties under AG \u00b6 20: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; and \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \n  \nAG \u00b6 20(b) minimally applies, but none of the other conditions apply. A debt that \nbecame delinquent several years ago is still considered recent because \u201can applicant\u2019s \nongoing, unpaid debts evidence a continuing course of conduct and, therefore, can be \nviewed as recent for purposes of the Guideline F mitigating conditions.\u201d ISCR Case No. \n15-06532 at 3 (App. Bd. Feb. 16, 2017) (citing ISCR Case No. 15-01690 at 2 (App. Bd. \nSept. 13, 2016)). The nature, frequency, and recency of Applicant\u2019s continuing financial \ndifficulties, and his failure to voluntarily and timely resolve his delinquent accounts for \nseveral years, cause me to conclude that it was not infrequent and it is likely to remain \nunchanged, much like it has been for several years. Applicant attributed his financial \nproblems to his unemployment, but his largest account became delinquent and was \ncharged off over a year before his October 2014 unemployment.  \n \nAn applicant who begins to resolve his financial problems only after being placed \non notice that his or her security clearance is in jeopardy may be lacking in the judgment \nand self-discipline to follow rules and regulations over time or when there is no immediate \nthreat to his or her own interests. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 17-01213 at 5 (App. Bd. Jun. \n29, 2018); ISCR Case No. 17-00569 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Sept. 18, 2018). Applicant \ncompleted his SF 86 in July 2017; underwent his OPM interview in May 2018; and the \n\n \n7 \n                                      \n \nSOR was issued in May 2019. Each step of the security clearance review process placed \nhim on notice of the significance of the financial issues confronting him. Applicant \nadmittedly did not contact his creditors either to seek repayment agreements, or to \nactually start making payments, before his OPM interview. Although he claimed that his \naccounts had zero balances when he submitted his responses to the interrogatories in \nMarch 2019, in his Answer to the SOR, he admitted that the accounts were still delinquent. \nHe has a proven history of making no efforts to resolve his delinquent accounts. \n \nClearance decisions are aimed at evaluating an applicant\u2019s judgment, reliability, \nand trustworthiness. They are not a debt-collection procedure. The guidelines do not \nrequire an applicant to establish resolution of every debt or issue alleged in the SOR. An \napplicant needs only to establish a plan to resolve financial problems and take significant \nactions to implement the plan. There is no requirement that an applicant immediately \nresolve issues or make payments on all delinquent debts simultaneously, nor is there a \nrequirement that the debts or issues alleged in an SOR be resolved first. Rather, a \nreasonable plan and concomitant conduct may provide for the payment of such debts, or \nresolution of such issues, one at a time. Mere promises to pay debts in the future, without \nfurther confirmed action, are insufficient.  \nIt should be noted that the Appeal Board has indicated that promises to pay off \ndelinquent debts in the future are not a substitute for a track record of paying debts in a \ntimely manner and otherwise acting in a financially responsible manner. ISCR Case No. \n07-13041 at 4 (App. Bd. Sep. 19, 2008) (citing ISCR Case No. 99-0012 at 3 (App. Bd. \nDec. 1, 1999)). In this instance, there is no evidence, supported by documentation, that \nApplicant took any corrective actions with respect to his delinquent debts. There is an \nunverified comment by Applicant that he currently has no delinquent accounts, but he \noffered no substantial documentation to support his contentions or that he had taken any \ngood-faith efforts to resolve his delinquent debts. The Appeal Board has previously \nexplained what constitutes a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise \nresolve debts: \nIn order to qualify for application of [the \u201cgood-faith\u201d mitigating condition], an \napplicant must present evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or some other good-faith action aimed at resolving the \napplicant\u2019s debts. The Directive does not define the term \u201cgood-faith.\u201d \nHowever, the Board has indicated that the concept of good-faith \u201crequires \na showing that a person acts in a way that shows reasonableness, \nprudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.\u201d Accordingly, an \napplicant must do more than merely show that he or she relied on a legally \navailable option (such as bankruptcy [or statute of limitations]) in order to \nclaim the benefit of [the \u201cgood-faith\u201d mitigating condition].  \n \n(internal citation and footnote omitted) ISCR Case No. 02-30304 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 20, \n2004) (quoting ISCR Case No. 99-9020 at 5-6 (App. Bd. June 4, 2001)). \n \n\n \n8 \n                                      \n \nThere is no evidence of financial counseling or a budget. In the absence of \nadditional financial information, it remains difficult to determine if Applicant is currently in \na better position financially than he had been. Applicant\u2019s actions, or inaction, under the \ncircumstances cast doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. \nSee ISCR Case No. 09-08533 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Oct. 6, 2010). \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Personal Conduct is set out in \nAG \u00b6 15: \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. The following will normally result in \nan unfavorable national security eligibility determination, security clearance \naction, or cancellation of further processing for national security eligibility: \n \n(a) refusal, or failure without reasonable cause, to undergo or \ncooperate with security processing, including but not limited \nto meeting with a security investigator for subject interview, \ncompleting security forms or releases, cooperation with \nmedical \nor \npsychological \nevaluation, \nor \npolygraph \nexamination, if authorized and required; and \n \n(b) refusal to provide full, frank, and truthful answers to lawful \nquestions of investigators, security officials, or other official \nrepresentatives in connection with a personnel security or \ntrustworthiness determination. \n \nThe guideline notes a condition that could raise security concerns under AG \u00b6 16:  \n \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts \nfrom any personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, \nor similar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment \nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine national security \neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities. \n \nAs noted above, in July 2017, when Applicant completed his SF 86, he responded \nto certain questions pertaining to his finances found in Section 26. Some of those \nquestions asked about the past and current status of his financial accounts. Applicant \nanswered \u201cno\u201d to all of those questions, and certified that his responses were \u201ctrue, \ncomplete, and correct\u201d to the best of his knowledge and belief. In fact, his answers were \nincorrect, for Applicant actually had delinquent accounts that clearly came within the \n\n \n9 \n                                      \n \nscope of the questions asked. In his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted that he had \ndeliberately falsified the material facts in his responses to the SF 86 inquiries. AG \u00b6 16(a) \nhas been established. \n \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions under AG \u00b6 17 that could \nmitigate security concerns arising from personal conduct. They include: \n \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; and \n \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate vulnerability \nto exploitation, manipulation, or duress; \n \nNeither of the mitigating conditions apply. Applicant\u2019s behavior reflects a general \nlack of candor that is not minor or infrequent, and it did not occur under unique \ncircumstances. Furthermore, Applicant has not taken any positive steps to reduce or \neliminate vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress. Applicant\u2019s actions under \nthe circumstances continue to cast doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, and \ngood judgment. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6 2(d): \n  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nUnder SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. Moreover, I have \nevaluated the various aspects of this case in light of the totality of the record evidence \nand have not merely performed a piecemeal analysis. See U.S. v. Bottone, 365 F.2d 389, \n392 (2d Cir. 1966); see also ISCR Case No. 03-22861 at 2-3 (App. Bd. Jun. 2, 2006).  \n \n\n \n10 \n                                      \n \nThere is some evidence in favor of mitigating Applicant\u2019s financial concerns. \nApplicant is a 30-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has been serving as a \nsecurity guard with his current employer since June 2017. He is also a volunteer firefighter \ncaptain. He is a 2008 high school graduate, and received an associate\u2019s degree in 2010. \nHe was commissioned into either the ANG or the Active Army Reserve, and he served \nfrom October 2010 until September 2014 when he was honorably discharged as a second \nlieutenant. He was granted a secret clearance on an unspecified date. \n \nThe disqualifying evidence under the whole-person concept is simply more \nsubstantial. Applicant admittedly deliberately falsified material facts on his SF 86. He had \nthree delinquent accounts that were essentially ignored by him until at least after he was \ninterviewed by the OPM investigator, and probably remained ignored until after he \nanswered the SOR. Although Applicant claims that he has zero debts, because of his \nfailure to submit documentation associated with his delinquent accounts, such as \nreceipts, cancelled checks, or bank account transactions, to support his contentions that \naccounts have been resolved, it is difficult to assess the true situation, for we have mostly \nApplicant\u2019s unverified comments regarding his debts. \n \nIn ISCR Case No. 07-06482 at 2-3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008), the Appeal Board \naddressed a key element in the whole-person analysis in financial cases stating: \n \nIn evaluating Guideline F cases, the Board has previously noted that the \nconcept of \u201cmeaningful track record\u201d necessarily includes evidence of actual \ndebt reduction through payment of debts. However, an applicant is not \nrequired, as a matter of law, to establish that he [or she] has paid off each \nand every debt listed in the SOR. All that is required is that an applicant \ndemonstrate that he [or she] has \u201c. . . established a plan to resolve his [or \nher] financial problems and taken significant actions to implement that plan.\u201d \nThe Judge can reasonably consider the entirety of an applicant\u2019s financial \nsituation and his [or her] actions in evaluating the extent to which that \napplicant\u2019s plan for the reduction of his outstanding indebtedness is credible \nand realistic. See Directive \u00b6 E2.2(a) (\u201cAvailable, reliable information about \nthe person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, should be \nconsidered in reaching a determination.\u201d) There is no requirement that a \nplan provide for payments on all outstanding debts simultaneously. Rather, \na reasonable plan (and concomitant conduct) may provide for the payment \nof such debts one at a time. Likewise, there is no requirement that the first \ndebts actually paid in furtherance of a reasonable debt plan be the ones \nlisted in the SOR. \n \nWhile Applicant contended that he now has zero debts, he never claimed to have \npaid off his SOR-related creditors. There is no documentary evidence to indicate that his \naccounts have been addressed. Applicant\u2019s current track record is poor at best. Overall, \nthe evidence leaves me with substantial questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility \nand suitability for a security clearance. For all of these reasons, I conclude Applicant has \nfailed to mitigate the security concerns arising from his financial considerations. See \nSEAD 4, App. A, AG \u00b6\u00b6 2(d)(1) through 2(d)(9). \n\n \n11 \n                                      \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a., through 1.c.:  \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.a.:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \n In light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n                                        \n         \n \n \n \n________________________ \nROBERT ROBINSON GALES \nAdministrative Judge \n",

De Angelis, Esq., Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro se \n10/23/2019\n__________ \nDecision \n__________ \nCurry, Marc, Administrative Judge: \nApplicant\u2019s father, a Ukrainian citizen living in the United States, does not \ngenerate a foreign influence security concern. Conversely, Applicant\u2019s mother, a \nRussian citizen living in the United States, his sister, a Russian citizen and resident, and \nhis Russian bank account generate security concerns that he failed to mitigate. \nClearance is denied. \nStatement of the Case \nOn May 3, 2019, the Department of Defense (DOD) Consolidated Adjudications \nFacility (CAF) issued a statement of reasons (SOR) alleging security concerns under \nGuideline B (foreign influence). The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1990), as amended; \nDOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review \nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the National Security \nAdjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information or \nEligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position, effective June 8, 2017. The SOR further informed \nApplicant that, based on information available to the Government, DOD adjudicators \ncould not make the affirmative finding that it is clearly consistent with the interests of \nnational security to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s security clearance. It recommended \n\n \n2 \n                                                                                                                                              \nthat his case be submitted to an administrative judge for a determination whether his \nclearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked. \n \nOn June 10, 2019, Applicant responded to the SOR, admitting all of the \nallegations, and requesting a decision on the record, rather than a hearing. Department \nCounsel submitted an undated File of Relevant Material (FORM). Applicant received the \nFORM on July 31, 2019, and was informed of his opportunity to respond within 30 days \nof receipt. Applicant did not file a response. On September 26, 2019, I was assigned the \ncase.  \n \nIn addition to nine exhibits (Items I - IX), the FORM includes a request for \nadministrative notice of facts encapsulated within 28 documents concerning Russia \n(Request for Administrative Notice: The Russian Federation, Items I-XXVIII), and two \ndocuments about Ukraine (Request for Administrative Notice: Ukraine, Items I \u2013 II). I \nhave taken administrative notice of these facts and considered them in my analysis of \nthe guideline. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant is a 35-year old single man. He was born and raised in what was then \nthe Soviet Union, and immigrated with his family to the United States in 2000. In August \n2009, he earned an associate\u2019s degree in the field of business administration. He \nbecame a naturalized U.S. citizen in April 2016. Applicant is a veteran of the Army \nNational Guard, serving from 2015 to 2018. He was honorably discharged. (Item 6 at 3)  \nHe has been working for a trucking company since June 2018. (Item 6 at 2) He has \nbeen offered a job as a linguist, pending the outcome of the security clearance process. \n(Item 4 at 17) \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s mother is a citizen of Russia who lives in the United States. She owns \nand operates a daycare center. Applicant\u2019s father is a citizen of Ukraine. He helps \nApplicant\u2019s mother run the daycare center. Both parents have permanent U.S. resident \nstatus. (Item 7 at 13) Applicant lives with his parents and communicates with them daily. \n \n \nApplicant has two sisters. His older sister was born in what was then the Soviet \nUnion and immigrated with the family to the United States in 2000. After graduating from \nhigh school, she returned to Russia in 2004. She is a teacher. Applicant communicates \nwith her approximately once per year via Skype. (Item 7 at 15) Applicant\u2019s last contact \nwith his sister occurred in 2017 during a visit to Russia. (Item 4 at 42) \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s younger sister was born after his family immigrated to the United \nStates. She is a U.S. citizen who is attending secondary school. (Item 7 at 16)  \n \n \nDuring Applicant\u2019s last visit to Russia in 2017, he opened a bank account. \nCurrently, the balance is approximately $20,000. The money in the account belongs to \nhis mother. She uses it to manage two rental properties that she owns in Russia. \nApplicant\u2019s sister and her family live in one of the rental properties. (Item 6 at 5) \n\n \n3 \n                                                                                                                                              \nApplicant\u2019s mother did not open the bank account herself because doing so would have \nrequired that she travel to Russia, and she was afraid that if she went, she would not be \nable to return to the United States. (Item 7 at 9)  Applicant is the only member of his \nfamily who is authorized to withdraw money from the account. (Item 6 at 5) \n \nAdministrative Notice \n \n \nRussia uses cyber operations as an instrument of intelligence collection to inform \nits decisionmaking and benefit its economic interest. (Item II at 4) Since at least 2007, \nRussia\u2019s state-sponsored cyber program has routinely collected intelligence on defense \nand geopolitical issues, including those relating to the United States. (Item II at 4) \nRussia\u2019s efforts to influence the 2016 U.S. presidential election represent the most \nrecent expression of its longstanding desire to undermine the U.S.-led liberal \ndemocratic order. (Item V at 1) These efforts marked a significant escalation of past \nattempts to influence U.S. elections. On December 19, 2018, the U.S. Departments of \nState and the Treasury announced sanctions against Russia for its \u201ccontinued and \nblatant disregard for international norms.\u201d (Item XV at 1) \n \n \nUkraine is a republic with a semi-presidential political system composed of three \nbranches of government. (Item I at 1). Civilian authorities generally maintained effective \ncontrol over security forces in territory controlled by the government.  However, in \nterritories controlled by Russia, there is widespread corruption, and there have been \nunlawful killings and politically motivated disappearances. (Item I at 1) \n  \nPolicies \n \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the \nExecutive Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security \nemphasizing, \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. \nEgan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the \nauthority to control access to information bearing on national security and to determine \nwhether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. \nat 527. The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant \napplicants eligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d  Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended.    \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable.  \n \n\n \n4 \n                                                                                                                                              \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if they must, \non the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline B, Foreign Influence \n \n  \nUnder this guideline, \u201cforeign contacts and interests, including, but not limited to, \nbusiness, financial, and property interests, are a national security concern if they result \nin divided allegiance.\u201d (AG \u00b6 6) Russia is an adversary that has historically sought to \nundermine Western, liberal values and is seeking to expand its influence worldwide \nthrough any means necessary, including espionage, cyberattacks, and interference in \nforeign elections. Under these circumstances, Applicant\u2019s relationship with his mother, a \nRussian citizen, and his sister, a Russian citizen and resident, trigger the application of \nAG \u00b6 7(a), \u201ccontact, regardless of method, with a foreign family member, business or \nprofessional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or resident in a foreign \ncountry if that contact creates a heightened risk of foreign exploitation, inducement, \nmanipulation, pressure, or coercion.\u201d  \n \n  \nApplicant\u2019s bank account in Russia raises the issue of whether AG \u00b6 7(f), \n\u201csubstantial business, financial, or property interests in a foreign country, or in any \nforeign-owned business that could subject the individual to a heightened risk of foreign \ninfluence or exploitation or personal conflict of interest,\u201d applies. Applicant contends this \nbank account generates no security risk because the money belongs to his mother. \nGiven the circumstances that he set up the account and the significant account balance, \nI conclude AG \u00b6 7(f) applies.  \n \n \nAlthough Ukraine has issues with human rights and corruption, there is no record \nevidence that it is seeking to expand its influence worldwide in contravention of U.S. \ninterests or objectives. Under these circumstances, Applicant\u2019s father, a Ukrainian \ncitizen living in the United States, does not generate a security concern. \n \n \nApplicant immigrated to the United States in 2000 when he was a teenager, and \nhe has spent all of his adult life here. He is a veteran of the National Guard, serving \nhonorably for three years. Given the history, scope, and breadth of Russia\u2019s espionage, \nwhich has worsened over the past five years, Applicant\u2019s connection to the United \nStates is simply not sufficient to overcome the very heavy burden generated by his \nmother, a Russian citizen, his sister, a Russian citizen and resident, and his Russian \nbank account. I conclude that none of the mitigating conditions apply, and that Applicant \nhas failed to mitigate the security concern. \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n5 \n                                                                                                                                              \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nIn reaching this decision, I was particularly cognizant of the circumstances \nsurrounding Applicant\u2019s ownership of a Russian bank account.  \n \nFormal Finding \n \nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:          \n \n  \nParagraph 1, Guideline B:   \n \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n  \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n  \nSubparagraph 1.b:  \n \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n  \nSubparagraphs 1.c \u2013 1.d:  \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the security interests of the United States to grant Applicant \neligibility for a security clearance.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact After considering the FORM as amended, I make the following findings of fact. Applicant is 59 years old and married with one daughter, age 36. He earned his associate\u2019s degree in May 1997. He has worked for his current employer, a defense contractor, since November 2017. (Items 3-4.) In May 2013, Applicant reportedly retired from his employment as a service technician with a telecommunications company after 14 years on the job. He immediately began working as an instrument technician for a defense contractor (company X) on a U.S. airbase, and was granted a Secret clearance in October 2013. On March 28, 2014, he consumed about four beers, apparently planning to be on scheduled leave from work that day. For some reason not apparent in the record, his vacation plans changed, and he reported to work for the second shift at approximately 3:30 p.m. Within the hour, he was required to submit to a random screen for drugs and alcohol. His blood alcohol level tested at .059% initially and .056% 15 minutes later. Because his alcohol level exceeded the 5 company\u2019s limit of .040%, Applicant was sent home immediately pending review for termination under company X\u2019s zero-tolerance policy. Applicant resigned that day, citing personal reasons, because he was concerned that he would be fired after the employer completed its investigation. (Items 4, 8-9.)

He was not completely candid on his \nSeptember 2017 security clearance application about the circumstances that led to his \nresignation. A June 2019 arrest for public intoxication and outstanding delinquencies \nexceeding $50,000 also cast doubt on his judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. \nClearance is denied. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \n \nOn April 17, 2019, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications Facility \n(DOD CAF) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant, detailing security concerns \nunder Guideline E, personal conduct, and Guideline F, financial considerations. The SOR \nexplained why the DOD CAF was unable to find it clearly consistent with the national \ninterest to grant or continue security clearance eligibility for him. The DOD CAF took the \naction under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \nIndustry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial \nPersonnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); \n\n2 \n \nand the National Security Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to \nClassified Information or Eligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position (AG) effective within the \nDOD on June 8, 2017. \n \nOn May 14, 2019, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations and requested a \ndecision based on the written record without a hearing by an administrative judge from the \nDefense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA). On June 4, 2019, the Government \nsubmitted a File of Relevant Material (FORM), consisting of eight exhibits (Items 1-8). \nDOHA forwarded a copy of the FORM to Applicant on June 7, 2019, and instructed him to \nrespond within 30 days of receipt. Applicant received the FORM on June 25, 2019. No \nresponse to the FORM was received by the July 25, 2019 deadline. On August 16, 2019, \nthe case was assigned to me to determine whether it is clearly consistent with the interests \nof national security to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant. I received the \ncase file on August 21, 2019. \n \nEvidentiary and Procedural Rulings \n \n \n  \n \nOn August 26, 2019, Department Counsel moved to amend the SOR to allege \nGuideline G, alcohol consumption, security concerns under a new paragraph 3, as follows: \n \na. On or about March 28, 2014, you resigned from [employer name omitted] \nafter testing positive for alcohol that same day, and facing automatic \ntermination pursuant to company policy. \n \nb. On about June 26, 2019, you were arrested for public intoxication and \ntransported to jail. You paid a fine of $370.00 and were released. \n \nDepartment Counsel also moved to supplement the record to include as Item 9 in \nthe FORM an incident history record. Acting under the authority of DOD Directive \u00b6\u00b6 \nE3.1.10 and E3.1.17, on August 27, 2019, I granted the motion and amended the SOR as \nalleged. The conduct alleged in SOR \u00b6 3.b occurred after the SOR was issued. Applicant \nwas directed to either admit or deny the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 3.a and 3.b within 20 days \nof his receipt of the amendment. He was granted 30 days to submit further information in \nresponse, including supporting documentation. Applicant confirmed his receipt of the \namendment containing the new allegations and a copy of proposed Item 9 on August 28, \n2019. On September 13, 2019, he responded to SOR \u00b6 3.b, as follows: \n \nI admit to the charge of being arrested for public intoxication on June 24, \n2019. I pleaded no contest and paid the fine and was released. \n \nApplicant did not answer SOR \u00b6 3.a. On September 16, 2019, I advised him that \nbecause SOR \u00b6 3.a alleged the same facts under Guideline G as SOR \u00b6 1.a under \nGuideline E, which he had previously admitted, I assumed he was admitting SOR \u00b6 3.a \nunless he notified me otherwise. I reminded him that he had until September 27, 2019, to \nfile any objections or comment to Item 9 and submit any documentation on his behalf. \nApplicant did not respond to SOR \u00b6 3.a or submit any objections to Item 9 by the \n\n3 \n \nSeptember 27, 2019 deadline. Accordingly, Item 9 was incorporated in the FORM without \nany objections. He also did not submit any additional information on his behalf, and so the \nrecord closed on September 27, 2019. \n  \nDepartment Counsel submitted as part of Item 4 of the FORM a summary report of \nApplicant\u2019s Personal Subject Interview (PSI) conducted on May 8, 2018, and May 15, \n2018. The summary report was part of the DOD Report of Investigation (ROI) in Applicant\u2019s \ncase. Under \u00b6 E3.1.20 of the Directive, a DOD personnel background report of \ninvestigation may be received in evidence and considered with an authenticating witness, \nprovided it is otherwise admissible under the Federal Rules of Evidence. The summary \nreport did not bear the authentication required for admissibility under \u00b6 E3.1.20. \n  \nIn ISCR Case No. 16-03126 decided on January 24, 2018, the Appeal Board held \nthat it was not error for an administrative judge to admit and consider a summary of \npersonal subject interview where the applicant was placed on notice of his or her \nopportunity to object to consideration of the summary; the applicant filed no objection to it; \nand there is no indication that the summary contained inaccurate information. In this case, \nApplicant was provided a copy of the FORM and advised of his opportunity to submit \nobjections or material that he wanted the administrative judge to consider. In the FORM, \nApplicant was advised as follows: \n  \nIMPORTANT NOTE FOR APPLICANT \u2013 Applicant was not given an \nopportunity to review and authenticate this summary document (Item 4) \nprior to issuance of the SOR. The Government acknowledges that, \nunder \u00b6 E3.1.20 of Enclosure 3 of Directive 5220.6, Applicant can object \nto its admissibility on this ground. The Government also acknowledges \nthat some of the information contained therein may not be entirely \ncorrect, or up to date. Applicant is therefore free to correct, revise or \nupdate the information in any Response to this filing, as well as to pose \nan objection to its admissibility. Moreover, while Applicant\u2019s interview \nmay add some details regarding his conduct, all facts alleged in the \nSOR are also proven and discussed elsewhere in this FORM. (Emphasis \nin original). \n \n \nConcerning whether Applicant understood the meaning of authentication or the legal \nconsequences of waiver, Applicant\u2019s pro se status does not confer any due process rights \nor protections beyond those afforded him if he was represented by legal counsel. He was \nadvised in \u00b6 E3.1.4 of the Directive that he may request a hearing. In \u00b6 E3.1.15, he was \nadvised that he is responsible for presenting evidence to rebut, explain, or mitigate facts \nadmitted by him or proven by Department Counsel and that he has the ultimate burden of \npersuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision. While the Directive does not \nspecifically provide for a waiver of the authentication requirement, Applicant was placed on \nsufficient notice of his opportunity to object to the admissibility of the interview summary \nreport, to comment on the interview summary, and to make any corrections, deletions, or \nupdates to the information in the report. He did not respond to the FORM. In the absence \nof any objections or indication that the summary report of his PSI contains inaccurate \n\n4 \n \ninformation, I accepted the PSI in evidence, subject to issues of relevance and materiality \nin light of the entire record. \n \nSummary of Pleadings \n \n \nThe amended SOR alleges under Guideline E that Applicant failed a random drug \nand alcohol screening test administered by his then employer in March 2014 and resigned \nto avoid automatic termination (SOR \u00b6 1.a). Applicant also allegedly falsified his September \n2017 Electronic Questionnaires for Investigations Processing (e-QIP) in two aspects, i.e., \nhe misrepresented the reason why he resigned from his employment in March 2014 (SOR \n\u00b6 1.b) and denied that he had been fired, quit after being told he would be fired, or he left \nby mutual agreement following allegations or charges of misconduct in the last seven years \n(SOR \u00b6 1.c). Under Guideline F, Applicant is alleged to owe charged-off or collection debts \ntotaling $56,744 on 16 accounts (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.a-2.p). Applicant\u2019s March 2014 employment \nresignation after testing positive for alcohol (SOR \u00b6 3.a) and a June 2019 arrest for public \nintoxication (SOR \u00b6 3.b) are alleged under Guideline G. \n \n \nWhen Applicant answered the SOR allegations, he admitted that he failed the \nrandom drug and alcohol screening test in March 2014 and that he resigned from that job \nrather than face automatic termination. He denied that he falsified his September 2017 e-\nQIP by indicating thereon that he left his job in March 2014 because he needed a daytime \njob (SOR \u00b6 1.b). He did not respond to SOR \u00b6 1.c alleging that he falsified his security \nclearance application by answering \u201cNo\u201d to an inquiry concerning whether, in the last seven \nyears, he had been fired, quit after being told he would be fired, or left after mutual \nagreement following charges or allegations of misconduct. His lack of a response was \ntaken as a denial by the Government. Applicant admitted the financial delinquencies \nalleged in the SOR. He also admitted his recent arrest in June 2019 for public intoxication \n(SOR \u00b6 3.b). \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nAfter considering the FORM as amended, I make the following findings of fact. \n \n \nApplicant is 59 years old and married with one daughter, age 36. He earned his \nassociate\u2019s degree in May 1997. He has worked for his current employer, a defense \ncontractor, since November 2017. (Items 3-4.) \n \n \nIn May 2013, Applicant reportedly retired from his employment as a service \ntechnician with a telecommunications company after 14 years on the job. He immediately \nbegan working as an instrument technician for a defense contractor (company X) on a U.S. \nairbase, and was granted a Secret clearance in October 2013. On March 28, 2014, he \nconsumed about four beers, apparently planning to be on scheduled leave from work that \nday. For some reason not apparent in the record, his vacation plans changed, and he \nreported to work for the second shift at approximately 3:30 p.m. Within the hour, he was \nrequired to submit to a random screen for drugs and alcohol. His blood alcohol level tested \nat .059% initially and .056% 15 minutes later. Because his alcohol level exceeded the \n\n5 \n \ncompany\u2019s limit of .040%, Applicant was sent home immediately pending review for \ntermination under company X\u2019s zero-tolerance policy. Applicant resigned that day, citing \npersonal reasons, because he was concerned that he would be fired after the employer \ncompleted its investigation. (Items 4, 8-9.) \n \n \nApplicant began working as a mechanic for his state\u2019s department of transportation \nin March 2014. He left that job in January 2016 for a better-paying job as a mechanic in the \ncommercial sector. In August 2017, he resigned because of \u201ctoo much travel time,\u201d and \nbegan working for his state in maintenance at a state park. After only a month, he was \noffered a position with his current employer at a nearby airbase. (Item 3.) \n \n \nOn September 18, 2017, Applicant completed and certified to the accuracy of a \nQuestionnaire for National Security Positions (SF 86) incorporated within an e-QIP. In \nresponse to section 13A concerning employment activities, Applicant listed his various jobs \nsince January 1999, including with company X. He gave as the reason for leaving his \nemployment with company X that he \u201cneeded daytime job due to family.\u201d Applicant \nresponded \u201cNo\u201d to an inquiry concerning whether, in the last seven years, he had been \nfired, quit after being told he would be fired, left by mutual agreement following charges or \nallegations of misconduct, or left by mutual agreement following notice of unsatisfactory \nperformance. Applicant listed in response to the police record inquiries that he had pled no \ncontest to a misdemeanor driving under the influence (DUI) charge in May 1986. He also \ndisclosed two debts totaling $10,000 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.e and 2.p) in response to inquiries \nconcerning any routine delinquencies in the last seven years, and explained that he was \ntrying to earn more income to pay his creditors. (Item 3.) \n \n \nApplicant owed several more delinquencies than the two debts disclosed on his SF \n86. His delinquent accounts, as reported by one or more of the three credit reporting \nagencies on September 22, 2017 (Item 5), April 18, 2018 (Item 6), and March 26, 2019 \n(Item 7), and as discussed during his May 15, 2018 subject interview (Item 4) are shown in \nthe following table: \n \nDebt in SOR  \nDelinquency history \nPayment status \na. \n$9,979 \ncredit \ncard \ncharged off \nOpened July 1994, $8,800 \ncredit limit;

last activity \nFeb. 2016; $7,891 charged \noff Feb. 2017; in collection \nas of Mar. 2018.  \nSettled for less than full \nbalance. \n  \n \nOn May 8, 2018, and on May 15, 2018, Applicant was interviewed by an authorized \ninvestigator for the Office of Personnel Management (OPM). During his first interview, \nApplicant reported a history of social drinking starting in his early 20s. He denied any \nconsumption of alcohol to excess since his 1986 DUI, which he described was an isolated \nincident due to his youth and immaturity. He reported drinking three or four beers once or \ntwice a month since May 1983, becoming intoxicated no more than once a month. While \nhe had consumed four beers over about three hours\u2019 time before reporting to work on \nMarch 28, 2014, he did not then believe that he had alcohol in his system. When \nconfronted with his negative response to the SF 86 questions asking whether he had quit a \njob after being told he would be fired or whether he had left a job under mutual agreement \nfollowing allegations of misconduct, Applicant stated that he had hoped to find a day-shift \njob to assist his spouse with her medical needs before then volunteering that he would not \nhave resigned if he had not failed a random test for alcohol. He admitted that he should \nhave answered \u201cYes\u201d to the SF 86 inquiry, but asserted that he was under the impression \nat the time that because he had resigned, company X would not complete an investigation \nand his employment record would not show that he had resigned for failing the test. He \n\n8 \n \nthen admitted that he had not fully detailed the reasons for his resignation on his SF 86 \nbecause he feared the information would affect his ability to maintain a security clearance. \nWhen later discussing the personal conduct implications of his negative response to the \nemployment inquiry on his SF 86, he claimed he answered as he did because he did not \nknow for certain that he would have been fired. (Item 4.) \n \n \nDuring his May 8, 2018 interview, Applicant acknowledged the delinquencies on his \ncredit record except for the $7,891 charged-off installment loan (SOR \u00b6 1.p), which he did \nnot recognize. He volunteered that some creditors had pursued court action; that one \ncreditor filed a lien against his property; and that he had consulted with a bankruptcy \nattorney in late 2017, but was advised that his current income was too high to file for a \nChapter 13 [sic] bankruptcy. He expressed a desire to pay his creditors in full. He indicated \nthat he did not know where to start with respect to resolving his delinquent debts. Applicant \nattributed his financial problems to having to pay for medical insurance for his spouse after \nhe quit his job in March 2014; to his income from March 2014 to November 2017 being \nabout half of what it had been previously; and to his spouse\u2019s unemployment for medical \nreasons. (Item 4.) \n \n \nDuring his May 15, 2018 interview, Applicant explained that he and his spouse used \ncredit cards to cover some financial obligations. He identified those creditors who had \nobtained default judgments against him. He expressed an intention and plan to contact his \ncreditors and make payments at $50 a month, with the exception of the judgment debts \n(SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.d and 2.k) where he was under court order to pay $200 per month toward each \ndebt. He estimated his monthly expenses at $2,270, and indicated that he would have \n$180 in discretionary income if he made his payments to his creditors. He explained that if \nhis creditors refused to accept his planned payments, he would seek counseling through a \nbankruptcy court. The OPM investigator gave Applicant five days to provide receipts for \npayments on the judgments. (Item 4.) There is no evidence that he provided any \ndocumentation of repayment. As of March 2019, the charged-off balances were still being \nreported on his credit record as past due. \n \n \nApplicant was arrested for public intoxication on approximately June 26, 2019. He \npled no contest and paid a fine of $370. In self-reporting the incident to his employer on \nJuly 2, 2019, Applicant explained that he and his spouse argued after he arrived home \nfrom work around 11:30 p.m. on June 25, 2019; that his spouse left the house; that he \ndrove around looking for her without success throughout the night; that around 8:00 in the \nmorning, he stopped at a friend\u2019s home, and he was given \u201cpart of a 12-pack\u201d of beer and \ntold to go home. He stated that he consumed one part of a beer before stopping off at fuel \nstation where he drank another can of beer at the pump. The police were called. After \ntaking a field sobriety test, he was arrested for public intoxication and taken to the county \njail where he paid a $370 fine. (Item 9.) Applicant now recalls the incident as occurring on \nJune 24, 2019. He presented no documentation clarifying the date or corroborating his \naccount of the circumstances of his arrest. \n\n9 \n \nPolicies \n \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion the Executive \nBranch has in regulating access to information pertaining to national security,  emphasizing \nthat \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 \nU.S. 518, 528 (1988). When evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, \nthe administrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are required to be considered in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. These guidelines \nare not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, \nthese guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative \nprocess. The administrative judge\u2019s overall adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious \nscrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative \njudge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, \nfavorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence \nto establish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant \nis responsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation about potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Section 7 of EO 10865 \nprovides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a \ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section \n3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information). \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline E: Personal Conduct \n \n \nThe security concern about personal conduct is articulated in AG \u00b6 15: \n \n\n10 \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions about \nan individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified or \nsensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to cooperate or provide \ntruthful and candid answers during national security investigative or \nadjudicative processes. \n \n \nApplicant admits that he engaged in poor judgment contemplated within Guideline E \nwhen he reported to work on March 28, 2014, under the influence of alcohol, as shown by \na failed random drug and alcohol screening test administered to him. He resigned from his \nposition that same afternoon rather than face automatic termination under his then \nemployer\u2019s policy. Disqualifying condition AG \u00b6 16(d) applies. It provides: \n \n(d) credible adverse information that is not explicitly covered under any other \nguideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an adverse determination, but \nwhich, when combined with all available information, supports a whole-\nperson \nassessment \nof \nquestionable \njudgment, \nuntrustworthiness, \nunreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and \nregulations, or other characteristics indicating that the individual may not \nproperly safeguard classified or sensitive information. This includes, but is \nnot limited to, consideration of: \n \n(1) untrustworthy or unreliable behavior to include breach of \nclient confidentiality, release of proprietary information, \nunauthorized release of sensitive corporate or government \nprotected information; \n \n(2) any disruptive, violent, or other inappropriate behavior; \n \n(3) a pattern of dishonesty or rule violations; and  \n \n(4) evidence of significant misuse of Government or other \nemployer\u2019s time or resources. \n \n \nWith regard to AG \u00b6 16(d)(3), there is no evidence that Applicant had reported to \nwork under the influence of alcohol on any other occasion. It is inappropriate behavior \nunder AG \u00b6 16(d)(2), however, in that it was in violation of his then employer\u2019s zero-\ntolerance policy. \n \n \nApplicant denies that he deliberately falsified his September 2017 SF 86 by \nmisrepresenting the reason why he resigned from that employment (SOR \u00b6 1.b). He did not \nadmit or deny that he falsified his SF 86 by responding \u201cNo\u201d to whether he was fired, quit \nknowing that he would be fired, or left by mutual agreement following charges or \nallegations of misconduct (SOR \u00b6 1.c). The Appeal Board has repeatedly held that, to \nestablish a falsification, it is not enough merely to demonstrate that an applicant\u2019s answers \nwere not true. To raise security concerns under Guideline E, the answers must be \n\n11 \n \ndeliberately false. In analyzing an applicant\u2019s intent, the administrative judge must consider \nan applicant\u2019s answers in light of the record evidence as a whole. See e.g., ISCR Case No. \n14-05005 (App. Bd. Sep. 15, 2017): ISCR Case No. 10-04821 (App. Bd. May 21, 2012). \nOn his SF 86, Applicant gave as his reason for leaving company X is that he \u201cneeded a \ndaytime job due to family.\u201d This may not have been false, but it was incomplete and clearly \nmisleading in light of his negative response to whether he had been fired; quit after being \ntold that he would be fired; left by mutual agreement following charges or allegations of \nmisconduct; or left by mutual agreement following notice of unsatisfactory performance. \nApplicant resigned to avoid termination. His lack of candor on his SF 86 about the \ncircumstances under which he left the employment of company X triggers AG \u00b6 16(a), \nwhich states: \n \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar \nform used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, \naward benefits or status, determine national security eligibility or \ntrustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities. \n \n \nApplicant has the burdens of proof and persuasion with regard to establishing \nmitigation. AG \u00b6 17(a), \u201cthe individual made prompt good-faith efforts to correct the \nomission, concealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts,\u201d warrants \nsome consideration because Applicant detailed the circumstances surrounding his \nresignation from company X when he was interviewed by the OPM investigator on May 8, \n2018. Yet, it took some prompting from the investigator for him to acknowledge that he did \nnot fully disclose the circumstances that led to his resignation from company X when he \ncompleted his SF 86 because he feared the impact of the information on his security \nclearance eligibility. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 17(c) has some applicability because of the passage of time since the March \n2014 incident. There has been no recurrence of him reporting to work under the influence \nof alcohol or otherwise violating an employer\u2019s policy in the last five years. AG \u00b6 17(c) \nprovides: \n \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is so \ninfrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is unlikely \nto recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment. \n \n \nApplicant acknowledged his poor judgment with respect to cancelling his leave and \nreporting to work after drinking in March 2014 during his OPM interview. He also admitted \nto the OPM investigator that he should have detailed on his SF 86 the adverse \ncircumstances under which he left that employment. AG \u00b6 17(d) provides: \n \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling to \nchange that behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the stressors, \n\n12 \n \ncircumstances, or factors that contribute to untrustworthy, unreliable, or other \ninappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to recur. \n \n \nHowever, the personal conduct security concerns are not fully mitigated under AG \n\u00b6\u00b6 17(c) or 17(d). His June 2019 arrest for public intoxication, that occurred after he \nreceived and responded to the SOR, undermines his case for reform as to whether he can \nbe counted on to exercise the good judgment expected of persons with clearance eligibility. \nDespite his admission to the OPM investigator that he answered the SF employment \ninquiries as he did because he feared the impact on his clearance eligibility, he is now not \nwilling to acknowledge that he intentionally concealed or misrepresented the circumstances \nunder which he left that employment. Concerns about his personal conduct persist. \n \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \n \n \nThe security concerns about financial considerations are articulated in AG \u00b6 18: \n \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness \nto abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about an \nindividual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified or \nsensitive information. Financial distress can also be caused or exacerbated \nby, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other issues of personnel security \nconcern such as excessive gambling, mental health conditions, substance \nmisuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An individual who is financially \noverextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or otherwise \nquestionable acts to generate funds. . . . \n \n \nThe Appeal Board explained the scope and rationale for the financial considerations \nsecurity concern in ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012) (citation omitted) \nas follows: \n \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an applicant might knowingly \ncompromise classified information in order to raise money in satisfaction of \nhis or her debts. Rather, it requires a Judge to examine the totality of an \napplicant\u2019s financial history and circumstances. The Judge must consider \npertinent evidence regarding the applicant\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other \nqualities essential to protecting the national secrets as well as the \nvulnerabilities inherent in the circumstances. The Directive presumes a \nnexus between proven conduct under any of the Guidelines and an \napplicant\u2019s security eligibility. \n \nApplicant\u2019s credit reports of September 2017, April 2018, and March 2019, and \nApplicant\u2019s admissions during his May 2018 subject interviews, establish the delinquencies \nalleged in the SOR. His delinquent balances accrued to approximately $58,376. \nDisqualifying conditions AG \u00b6 19(a), \u201cinability to satisfy debts,\u201d and AG \u00b6 19(c), \u201ca history of \nnot meeting financial obligations,\u201d apply. \n\n13 \n \nFour mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 could apply in whole or in part: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under \nsuch circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the \nindividual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem from a \nlegitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit counseling service, \nand there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under \ncontrol; and \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \n \nAG \u00b6 20(a) is only minimally established. The debts are not new delinquencies. \nSeveral of the debts became past due in 2015 and were charged off in 2016. Judgments \nwere entered against him for five of the debts, and he had a court hearing pending on \nanother judgment filing as of May 2018. As of March 2019, a $7,891 charged-off debt \n(SOR \u00b6 2.p) was reportedly settled for less than its full balance, but the other debts in the \nSOR had not been resolved. Those debts are considered recent because \u201can applicant\u2019s \nongoing, unpaid debts evidence a continuing course of conduct and, therefore, can be \nviewed as recent for purposes of the Guideline F mitigating conditions.\u201d ISCR Case No. 15-\n06532 at 3 (App. Bd. Feb. 16, 2017) (citing ISCR Case No. 15-01690 at 2 (App. Bd. Sept. \n13, 2016)). \n \nRegarding AG \u00b6 20(b), Applicant attributes his financial problems to insufficient \nincome between March 2014, when he resigned from company X, and November 2017, \nwhen he started his current employment. Applicant\u2019s spouse is apparently unable to work \nbecause of medical reasons not explained. Three of the collection debts in the SOR (\u00b6\u00b6 \n2.f, 2.m, and 2.o) are medical debts. Nonetheless, AG \u00b6 20(b) cannot fully apply in \nmitigation where the job loss was caused by Applicant\u2019s own misconduct in reporting to \nwork under the influence of alcohol. Furthermore, even if Applicant\u2019s financial difficulties \ninitially arose, in whole or in part, due to circumstances outside of his control, I have to \nconsider whether Applicant acted in a reasonable manner when dealing with his financial \ndifficulties. See ISCR Case No. 05-11366 at 4, n.9 (App. Bd. Jan. 12, 2007) (citing ISCR \nCase No. 99-0462 at 4 (App. Bd. May 25, 2000); ISCR Case No. 99-0012 at 4 (App. Bd. \nDec. 1, 1999); ISCR Case No. 03-13096 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 29, 2005)). \n \nApplicant told an OPM investigator in May 2018 that he was court-ordered to pay \ntwo judgment debts (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d and 1.k) at $200 a month through October 2019 after an \n\n14 \n \ninitial $500 payment on each account. Based on his present income, he reported he could \nmake $50 monthly payments on his other delinquencies. The account in SOR \u00b6 1.p was \nreported on his March 2019 credit report as settled for less than its full balance as of \nJanuary 2019, but there is no documentation showing repayment on his other \ndelinquencies. Even giving Applicant some time to regain his financial stability after he \nbegan his current employment, he could reasonably be expected to have made more \nprogress toward addressing his past-due debts by the close of the record in September \n2019.  \n \nThe FORM is silent as to the amount paid to settle the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.p, but it \nappears to have been legally resolved. The Appeal Board has held that an applicant is not \nrequired to establish that he has paid off each debt in the SOR, or even that the first debts \npaid be those in the SOR. See ISCR Case No. 07-06482 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008). Yet, the \nAppeal Board recently reiterated in ADP Case No. 17-0063 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2018) that \n\u201can applicant must demonstrate a plan for debt repayment, accompanied by concomitant \nconduct, that is, conduct that evidences a serious intent to resolve the debts.\u201d Applicant \nhas not demonstrated a track record of timely payments on most of his delinquencies. \nInsufficient good faith is established when creditors have to resort to judgment actions. As \nof May 2018, Applicant was aware that four judgments had been entered against him and \nthat a fifth filing for judgment was pending hearing. A promise to pay a debt at some future \ndate is not a substitute for a track record of timely payments. Absent some evidence of \nApplicant\u2019s compliance with a current repayment plan, neither AG \u00b6 20(c) nor AG \u00b6 20(d) \napplies. The financial considerations security concerns are not mitigated. \n \nGuideline G: Alcohol Consumption \n \n \nThe security concern for alcohol consumption is articulated in AG \u00b6 21: \n \nExcessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable \njudgment or the failure to control impulses, and can raise questions about an \nindividual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness. \n \n \nApplicant allowed his alcohol consumption to negatively impact his judgment when \nhe reported to work after drinking in March 2014. His blood-alcohol level was .059%, which \nis under the legal limit for drunk driving, but it was a violation of his then employer\u2019s zero-\ntolerance policy against being under the influence of alcohol at work. Concerning his June \n2019 arrest for public intoxication, Applicant may have minimized the extent of his alcohol \nconsumption. He told his employer that he drank \u201cone part of a beer\u201d before stopping off at \nservice station and drinking one beer at the gas pump. He was arrested after a field- \nsobriety test. While the police report is not part of the file, the police are unlikely to have \narrested and fined him unless he showed signs of intoxication. The following disqualifying \nconditions under AG \u00b6 22 apply: \n \n(a) alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while under the \ninfluence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or other \nincidents of concern, regardless of the frequency of the individual\u2019s alcohol \n\n15 \n \nuse or whether the individual has been diagnosed with alcohol use disorder; \nand  \n \n(b) alcohol-related incidents at work, such as reporting for work or duty in an \nintoxicated or impaired condition, drinking on the job, or jeopardizing the \nwelfare and safety of others, regardless of whether the individual is \ndiagnosed with alcohol use disorder. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 23 provides for the following mitigating conditions: \n \n(a) so much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or \ngood judgment; \n \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her pattern of maladaptive alcohol \nuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and has \ndemonstrated a clear and established pattern of modified consumption or \nabstinence in accordance with treatment recommendations; \n \n(c) the individual is participating in counseling or a treatment program, has no \nprevious history of treatment and relapse, and is making satisfactory \nprogress in a treatment program; and  \n \n(d) the individual has successfully completed a treatment program along with \nany required aftercare, and has demonstrate a clear and established pattern \nof modified consumption or abstinence in accordance with treatment \nrecommendations. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 23(a) has some applicability in that the incidents appear to be isolated. AG \u00b6 \n23(b) is partially established because Applicant acknowledged his poor judgment in \ndrinking before reporting for duty in March 2014. He self-reported his arrest in June 2019 to \nhis employer, but he was impaired enough for the police to arrest him after a field sobriety \ntest. There is no evidence that Applicant has had any alcohol counseling or taken other \nsteps since the incident of June 2019 to ensure that there will be no recurrence of alcohol \nadversely affecting his judgment in the future. His public intoxication is too soon to enable a \npredictive judgment that similar incidents are unlikely to recur. \n  \nWhole-Person Concept \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of his conduct and \nall relevant circumstances in light of the nine adjudicative process factors in AG \u00b6 2(d): \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances \nsurrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the \n\n16 \n \nfrequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at \nthe time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which participation is voluntary; (6) \nthe presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral \nchanges; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, \ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or \nrecurrence. \n \nSecurity clearance decisions are not intended as punishment for past specific \nconduct. The security clearance assessment is a reasonable and careful evaluation of an \napplicant\u2019s circumstances and whether they cast doubt upon his judgment, self-control, and \nother characteristics essential to protecting national security information. Applicant \npresented little information to overcome the security concerns. It is well settled that once a \nconcern arises regarding an applicant\u2019s security clearance eligibility, there is a strong \npresumption against the grant or renewal of a security clearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, \n913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th Cir. 1990). After applying the disqualifying and mitigating \nconditions to the evidence presented, I conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant or continue security clearance eligibility for Applicant. \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the amended \nSOR, as required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline E:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.b: \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline F:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 2.a-2.o: \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.p:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nParagraph 3, Guideline G:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 3.a-3.b: \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue eligibility for a security \nclearance for Applicant. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n________________________ \nElizabeth M. Matchinski \nAdministrative Judge \n",

On April 17, 2019, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications \nFacility (DoD CAF) issued Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR), detailing security \nconcerns under Guideline F, Financial Considerations. (Item 1.) The action was taken \nunder Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry \n(February 20, 1960), as amended; DoD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel \nSecurity Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and \nNational Security Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to \nClassified Information or Eligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position (AG), effective June 8, \n2017. \n \n \nApplicant answered the SOR on May 5, 2019. She neither admitted nor denied \nthe three SOR allegations, but merely wrote \u201cSee attach.\u201d Nothing was attached to the \nanswer provided to me. On June 13, 2019, Department Counsel submitted the \nGovernment\u2019s written case. A complete copy of the File of Relevant Material (FORM), \n\n \n \n2 \n \n \ncontaining five Items, was received by the Applicant, who acknowledged receipt on \nJune 19, 2019. The FORM notified Applicant that she had an opportunity to file \nobjections and submit material in refutation, extenuation, or mitigation within 30 days of \nhis receipt of the FORM. Applicant submitted nothing.   \n \nFindings of Fact  \n \nGuideline F \u2013 Financial Considerations \n \n \nApplicant is 53 years old. She is unmarried, but has two adult children. (GX 2 at \npages 7, 15 and 21~22.) \n \n \n1.a. It is alleged that Applicant is indebted to Creditor A for a past-due debt in the \namount of about $3,635. This allegation is supported by a March 2019 credit report. \n(Item 5 at page 2.) Applicant failed to submit any evidence in mitigation. This allegation \nis found against Applicant. \n \n \n1.b. It is alleged that Applicant is indebted to Creditor B for a past-due debt in the \namount of about $15,841. This allegation is also supported by a March 2019 credit \nreport. (Item 5 at page 2.) Applicant failed to submit any evidence in mitigation. This \nallegation is found against Applicant. \n \n \n1.c. It is alleged that Applicant is indebted to Creditor C for a past-due debt in the \namount of about $8,631. This allegation is supported by a March 2019 credit report. \n(Item 5 at page 2.) Applicant failed to submit any evidence in mitigation. This allegation \nis found against Applicant. \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for national security eligibility, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines (AG) list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility. \n \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. The entire \nprocess is a conscientious scrutiny of applicable guidelines in the context of a number \nof variables known as the whole-person concept. The administrative judge must \nconsider all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable \nand unfavorable, in making a decision. \n \n\n \n \n3 \n \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. I have not drawn inferences based on mere \nspeculation or conjecture.  \n \n \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.14, requires the Government to present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d  \n \n \nA person applying for national security eligibility seeks to enter into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants national security eligibility. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified or \nsensitive information. Finally, as emphasized in Section 7 of EO 10865, \u201c[a]ny \ndetermination under this order adverse to an applicant shall be a determination in terms \nof the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information.) \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F - Financial Considerations \n \n \nThe security concerns relating to the guideline for financial considerations are set \nout in AG \u00b6 18, which reads in pertinent part:       \n \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability \nto protect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can \nalso be caused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible \nindicator of, other issues of personnel security concern such as \nexcessive gambling, mental health conditions, substance misuse, or \nalcohol abuse or dependence. An individual who is financially \noverextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or \notherwise questionable acts to generate funds. . . .   \n\n \n \n4 \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 19 describes three conditions that could raise security concerns and may \nbe disqualifying in this case:  \n \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; \n \n(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so; and \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \n \nApplicant has significant past-due debt, and submited nothing in mitigation. \nThese facts establish prima facie support for the foregoing disqualifying conditions, and \nshift the burden to Applicant to mitigate those concerns. \n \n \n \nThe guideline includes six conditions in AG \u00b6 20 that could mitigate the security \nconcerns arising from Applicant\u2019s alleged financial difficulties: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control; \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \n \nNone of these apply. Applicant; despite given an opportunity to respond to the \nSOR and the FORM, has done nothing. As such, the record does not establish \nmitigation of financial security concerns under the provisions of AG \u00b6 20. \n \n \n\n \n \n5 \n \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \n \nAccording to AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant national \nsecurity eligibility must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the applicable guidelines and the whole-person concept. \n    \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \npertinent facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Overall, the record evidence \nleaves me with serious questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s judgment, eligibility, and \nsuitability for a security clearance. She has not met her burden to mitigate the security \nconcerns arising under the guideline for financial considerations. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \n     AGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a through1.c: \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant national security eligibility \nand a security clearance.

Dorsey, Esquire, Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro se \n12/12/2019\nDecision \nGALES, Robert Robinson, Administrative Judge: \nApplicant failed to mitigate the security concerns regarding financial \nconsiderations. Eligibility for a security clearance is denied. \nStatement of the Case \nOn December 6, 2017, Applicant applied for a security clearance and submitted a \nQuestionnaire for National Security Positions (SF 86). On May 31, 2019, the Department \nof Defense (DOD) Consolidated Adjudications Facility (CAF) issued a Statement of \nReasons (SOR) to him, under Executive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended and modified; \nDOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program \n(January 2, 1992), as amended and modified (Directive); and Directive 4 of the Security \nExecutive Agent (SEAD 4), National Security Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) (December \n10, 2016), for all covered individuals who require initial or continued eligibility for access \nto classified information or eligibility to hold a sensitive position, effective June 8, 2017. \n The SOR alleged security concerns under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) \nand detailed reasons why the DOD adjudicators were unable to find that it is clearly \n\n \n2 \n                                      \n \nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant. \nThe SOR recommended referral to an administrative judge to determine whether a \nclearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked.  \n \n \nIn two sworn statements, dated August 15, 2019, and September 27, 2019, \nApplicant responded to the SOR, and he elected to have his case decided on the written \nrecord in lieu of a hearing. (Item 2) A complete copy of the Government\u2019s file of relevant \nmaterial (FORM) was mailed to Applicant by the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals \n(DOHA) on October 10, 2019, and he was afforded an opportunity after receipt of the \nFORM to file objections and submit material in refutation, extenuation, or mitigation. In \naddition to the FORM, Applicant was furnished a copy of the Directive as well as the \nAdjudicative Guidelines applicable to his case. Applicant received the FORM on October \n21, 2019. His response was due on November 20, 2019. Applicant chose not to respond \nto the FORM, for as of December 10, 2019, no response had been received. The case \nwas assigned to me on December 10, 2019.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nIn his initial Answer to the SOR, Applicant failed to admit or deny any of the SOR \nallegations. Instead, he addressed the allegations generally and offered comments \nregarding the issues raised in the SOR. In his Supplemental Answer, Applicant admitted, \nwith substantial comments, all of the factual allegations pertaining to financial \nconsiderations (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a. through 1.n.). Applicant\u2019s admissions are incorporated \nherein as findings of fact. After a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the \nrecord, and upon due consideration of same, I make the following additional findings of \nfact:  \n \nApplicant is a 51-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has been serving \nas a system administrator with his current employer since August 2017. Other than \nattending a vocational or technical school for several months in late 2008, for which he \ndid not receive a diploma, Applicant\u2019s educational background was not reported. He \nenlisted in the Inactive Naval Reserve in March 1986, and served until he was honorably \ndischarged in May 1991. He has never held a security clearance. Applicant was married \nin 1998 and divorced in 2017. He remarried in 2018. He has no children.  \n \nFinancial Considerations \n \nGeneral source information pertaining to the financial accounts discussed below \ncan be found in the following exhibits: Item 3 (SF 86, dated December 6, 2017); Item 5 \n(Combined Experian, TransUnion, and Equifax Credit Report, dated January 6, 2018); \nItem 4 (Enhanced Subject Interview, dated October 19, 2018); Item 6 (Equifax Credit \nReport, dated March 14, 2019); Item 2 (Applicant\u2019s Initial Answer to SOR, dated August \n15, 2019); and Item 2 (Applicant\u2019s Supplemental Answer, dated September 27, 2019). \nApplicant attributed his financial problems to a variety of factors commencing in \n2008: he reportedly underwent four back surgeries, at least one arm surgery, and three \noperations on his jaw as a result of a service-related injury while training in 1986; his \n\n \n3 \n                                      \n \nannual income plummeted from over $70,000 down to less than $40,000, due to his \ndisability; he was laid off in April 2017, and was unemployed until August 2017; although \nhe had paid 75 percent of the family bills until his first wife completed her nursing training, \nonce she did so, she refused to help him continue paying the bills and limited him to only \none half of her salary; she refused to include him on her health insurance unless he paid \nfor the extra costs of doing so; and he encountered a computer malfunction in 2016 and \nlost copies of his income tax returns for several years; and when he and his ex-wife \nseparated, he lost items that he thought were in his filing cabinet. (Item 2 \u2013 Initial Answer) \nAll of his comments and explanations are unverified and uncorroborated because \nApplicant failed to submit any documents to support his claims. \nWhen Applicant completed his December 2017 SF 86, he denied having any \ndelinquent accounts, but he acknowledged having failed to file and or pay, or both, his \nfederal and state income tax returns for several tax years. (Item 3, at 36-41)  In October \n2018, during his interview with an investigator from the U.S. Office of Personnel \nManagement (OPM), Applicant discussed his unfiled, misplaced, or lost tax returns. It \nwas only after he was confronted with additional delinquent accounts \u2013 primarily medical \naccounts \u2013 that he shared the facts associated with those accounts.  \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a. and 1.b.: The SOR alleged five years of unfiled federal and state \nincome tax returns. Applicant did not dispute his tax issues, but indicated that he had \nfound tax returns for the tax years 2011, 2012, and 2013, but was not convinced that he \nhad actually timely filed them. Those income tax returns could be copies of returns that \nhad been filed, or copies of returns that he had intended to file. He indicated that he \nplanned to re-submit the tax returns for those tax years, and that he would contact the \nInternal Revenue Service (IRS) to set up installment agreements to pay his income taxes \nfor the tax years 2014 and 2015 because copies of those income tax returns could still \nnot be located by him. He contended that he was now in a position to re-file his income \ntax returns and to pay any taxes owed. (Item 4, at 4) Applicant failed to submit any \ndocuments such as account transcripts from the IRS or the state revenue department to \nreflect that federal or state income tax returns for the tax years 2011 through 2015 had \nbeen filed; that installment agreements had been requested by him; or that any payments \nhad been made.  \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c. through 1.n.: The SOR also alleged 12 delinquent accounts, including \none credit-card account and 11 medical accounts, totaling approximately $17,332. Four \nof the delinquent medical accounts have balances of less than $150 each. (Item 5, at 5, \n10-11; Item 6, at 2; Item 2) Applicant claimed that he had taken on a personal loan and \nhas been making close to $5,000 in payments and intends to continue to do so when he \ncan. (Item 2; Item 4, at 4-5). He failed to submit any documentation, such as statements \nfrom his creditors agreeing to repayment plans, cancelled checks, copies of money \norders, a bank register, or receipts, to support his contention that he has any agreements \nand that he has made any payments to the creditor(s). In the absence of such \ndocumentation, with the exception of the account alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.h. for which the \nGovernment offered no evidence, and it appears to be erroneously alleged, I must \nconclude that the accounts, even those with minimal balances, have not been resolved, \nand they are not yet in the process of being resolved. \n\n \n4 \n                                      \n \nIt is not known what Applicant\u2019s current financial resources may be because he did \nnot report his current net monthly income; monthly expenses; and any monthly remainder \nthat might be available for discretionary spending or savings. There is no evidence of a \nbudget. There is no evidence of financial counseling. In the absence of additional financial \ninformation, it remains difficult to determine if Applicant is currently in a better position \nfinancially than he had been.  \nPolicies \n \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the Executive \nBranch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security emphasizing, \n\u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d (Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. \n518, 528 (1988)) As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to control \naccess to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual \nis sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information. The President has \nauthorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant an applicant eligibility for \naccess to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to do so.\u201d (Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \nIndustry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified.)     \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the guidelines in SEAD 4. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the guidelines list potentially disqualifying \nconditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility \nfor access to classified information. \n \nAn administrative judge need not view the guidelines as inflexible, ironclad rules \nof law. Instead, acknowledging the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. The entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known \nas the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a meaningful decision. \n \nIn the decision-making process, facts must be established by \u201csubstantial \nevidence.\u201d \u201cSubstantial evidence [is] such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might \naccept as adequate to support a conclusion in light of all contrary evidence in the record.\u201d  \n(ISCR Case No. 04-11463 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2006) (citing Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1))  \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d  (See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994)) \n \nThe Government initially has the burden of producing evidence to establish a \npotentially disqualifying condition under the Directive, and has the burden of establishing \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Once the Government has produced substantial \nevidence of a disqualifying condition, under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant has the \nburden of persuasion to present evidence in refutation, explanation, extenuation or \n\n \n5 \n                                      \n \nmitigation, sufficient to overcome the doubts raised by the Government\u2019s case. The \nburden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government. (See ISCR \nCase No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005)) \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours as well. It is \nbecause of this special relationship that the Government must be able to repose a high \ndegree of trust and confidence in those individuals to whom it grants access to classified \ninformation. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the \napplicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. Such \ndecisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather \nthan actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Furthermore, \u201csecurity clearance \ndeterminations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d (Egan, 484 U.S. at 531) \n \nClearance decisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense \nbe a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d (See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 \n7) Thus, nothing in this decision should be construed to suggest that I have based this \ndecision, in whole or in part, on any express or implied determination as to Applicant\u2019s \nallegiance, loyalty, or patriotism. It is merely an indication the Applicant has or has not \nmet the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for \nissuing a clearance.  In reaching this decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that \nare reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I \nhave avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG \u00b6 18:  \n      \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \n \n\n \n6 \n                                      \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19:  \n \n(a) inability to satisfy debts;  \n(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so;  \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \n \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay annual federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired. \n \n \nThe SOR alleged five years of unfiled federal and state income tax returns as well \nas 12 delinquent accounts, including one credit-card account and 11 medical accounts, \ntotaling approximately $17,332. One of the medical accounts was erroneously alleged. \nWith respect to Applicant\u2019s failure to timely file his federal and state income tax returns \nfor the tax years 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014, and 2015, AG \u00b6 19(f) has been established. \nWith respect to his failure to satisfy his various delinquent debts, AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and 19(c) \nhave been established, but there is no evidence that Applicant has been unwilling to \nsatisfy his debts regardless of an ability to do so, and AG \u00b6 19(b) has not been \nestablished.  \n \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns arising from financial difficulties under AG \u00b6 20: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control;  \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n  \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority \nto file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \n\n \n7 \n                                      \n \nAG \u00b6 20(b) minimally applies, but none of the other conditions apply. A debt that \nbecame delinquent several years ago is still considered recent because \u201can applicant\u2019s \nongoing, unpaid debts evidence a continuing course of conduct and, therefore, can be \nviewed as recent for purposes of the Guideline F mitigating conditions.\u201d (ISCR Case No. \n15-06532 at 3 (App. Bd. Feb. 16, 2017) (citing ISCR Case No. 15-01690 at 2 (App. Bd. \nSept. 13, 2016)). The nature, frequency, and recency of Applicant\u2019s continuing financial \ndifficulties, and his failure to voluntarily and timely resolve his delinquent accounts for \nseveral years, make it rather easy to conclude that it was not infrequent and it is likely to \nremain unchanged, much like it has been for several years. Applicant has attempted to \nattribute his financial problems that commenced in 2008 to surgeries; a reduction of his \nannual income unemployment from April 2017 until August 2017; and his first wife\u2019s \nrefusal to reasonably contribute to the family expenses. His failure to timely file his federal \nand state income tax returns over a multi-year period was blamed on a computer \nmalfunction in 2016. Applicant claims he has made efforts to resolve his accounts and re-\nfile his income tax returns, but as noted above, he failed to submit any documentation to \nsupport his claims, and he failed to indicate when those reported efforts commenced.  \n \nAn applicant who begins to resolve his financial problems only after being placed \non notice that his or her security clearance is in jeopardy may be lacking in the judgment \nand self-discipline to follow rules and regulations over time or when there is no immediate \nthreat to his or her own interests. (See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 17-01213 at 5 (App. Bd. Jun. \n29, 2018); ISCR Case No. 17-00569 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Sept. 18, 2018). Applicant \ncompleted his SF 86 in December 2017; underwent his OPM interview in October 2018; \nand the SOR was issued in May 2019. Each step of the security clearance review process \nplaced him on notice of the significance of the financial issues confronting him. With \nrespect to his delinquent debts, according to Applicant, he borrowed some money and \nmade small payments, but he offered no evidence to indicate if and when he did so. With \nrespect to his unfiled federal and state income tax returns, there is no evidence that \nApplicant took any action to contact the IRS or the state department of revenue until years \nafter those tax returns were required to be filed. \n \nThe DOHA Appeal Board has observed:  \n \nFailure to file tax returns suggests that an applicant has a problem with \ncomplying with well-established governmental rules and systems. Voluntary \ncompliance with such rules and systems is essential for protecting classified \ninformation. ISCR Case No. 01-05340 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 20, 2002). As we \nhave noted in the past, a clearance adjudication is not directed at collecting \ndebts. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 07-08049 at 5 (App. Bd. Jul. 22, 2008). By \nthe same token, neither is it directed toward inducing an applicant to file tax \nreturns. Rather, it is a proceeding aimed at evaluating an applicant\u2019s \njudgment and reliability. Id. A person who fails repeatedly to fulfill his or her \nlegal obligations does not demonstrate the high degree of good judgment \nand reliability required of those granted access to classified information. \nSee, e.g., ISCR Case No. 14-01894 at 5 (App. Bd. Aug. 18, 2015). See \nCafeteria & Restaurant Workers Union Local 473 v. McElroy, 284 F.2d 173, \n183 (D.C. Cir. 1960), aff\u2019d, 367 U.S. 886 (1961).  \n\n \n8 \n                                      \n \nISCR Case No. 14-04437 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 15, 2016). See ISCR Case No. 14-05476 \nat 5 (App. Bd. Mar. 25, 2016) (citing ISCR Case No. 01-05340 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 20, \n2002)); ISCR Case No. 14-01894 at 4-5 (App. Bd. Aug. 18, 2015). \n \nThe Appeal Board clarified that even in instances where an applicant has \npurportedly corrected his or her federal tax problem, and the fact that the applicant is now \nmotivated to prevent such problems in the future, does not preclude careful consideration \nof an applicant\u2019s security worthiness in light of his or her longstanding prior behavior \nevidencing irresponsibility including a failure to timely file federal income tax returns. (See \nISCR Case No. 15-01031 at 3 and note 3 (App. Bd. Jun. 15, 2016) (characterizing \u201cno \nharm, no foul\u201d approach to an Applicant\u2019s course of conduct and employed an \u201call\u2019s well \nthat ends well\u201d analysis as inadequate to support approval of access to classified \ninformation with focus on timing of filing of tax returns after receipt of the SOR). \n \nClearance decisions are aimed at evaluating an applicant\u2019s judgment, reliability, \nand trustworthiness. They are not a debt-collection procedure. The guidelines do not \nrequire an applicant to establish resolution of every debt or issue alleged in the SOR. An \napplicant needs only to establish a plan to resolve financial problems and take significant \nactions to implement the plan. There is no requirement that an applicant immediately \nresolve issues or make payments on all delinquent debts simultaneously, nor is there a \nrequirement that the debts or issues alleged in an SOR be resolved first. Rather, a \nreasonable plan and concomitant conduct may provide for the payment of such debts, or \nresolution of such issues, one at a time. Mere promises to pay debts in the future, without \nfurther confirmed action, are insufficient.  \nIt should be noted that the Appeal Board has indicated that promises to pay off \ndelinquent debts in the future are not a substitute for a track record of paying debts in a \ntimely manner and otherwise acting in a financially responsible manner. (ISCR Case No. \n07-13041 at 4 (App. Bd. Sept. 19, 2008) (citing ISCR Case No. 99-0012 at 3 (App. Bd. \nDec. 1, 1999)) In this instance, there is no evidence, supported by documentation, that \nApplicant took any good-faith corrective actions with respect to his delinquent debts \nbefore he was interviewed by the OPM investigator. There are some unverified comments \nby Applicant that he started to resolve some delinquent accounts, but he offered no \ndocumentation to support his contentions. His contentions regarding the status of some \naccounts, and his unverified comments claiming that he had taken certain actions, without \ndocuments, to support his claims, are insufficient to reflect good-faith actions. The Appeal \nBoard has previously explained what constitutes a good-faith effort to repay overdue \ncreditors or otherwise resolve debts: \nIn order to qualify for application of [the \u201cgood-faith\u201d mitigating condition], an \napplicant must present evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or some other good-faith action aimed at resolving the \napplicant\u2019s debts. The Directive does not define the term \u201cgood-faith.\u201d \nHowever, the Board has indicated that the concept of good-faith \u201crequires \na showing that a person acts in a way that shows reasonableness, \nprudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.\u201d Accordingly, an \napplicant must do more than merely show that he or she relied on a legally \n\n \n9 \n                                      \n \navailable option (such as bankruptcy [or statute of limitations]) in order to \nclaim the benefit of [the \u201cgood-faith\u201d mitigating condition].  \n \n(internal citation and footnote omitted) ISCR Case No. 02-30304 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 20, \n2004) (quoting ISCR Case No. 99-9020 at 5-6 (App. Bd. Jun. 4, 2001). \n \nThere is no evidence of financial counseling or a budget. In the absence of \nadditional financial information, it remains difficult to determine if Applicant is currently in \na better position financially than he had been. Applicant\u2019s actions, or inaction, under the \ncircumstances cast doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. \nSee ISCR Case No. 09-08533 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Oct. 6, 2010). \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6 2(d): \n  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nUnder SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. Moreover, I have \nevaluated the various aspects of this case in light of the totality of the record evidence \nand have not merely performed a piecemeal analysis. See U.S. v. Bottone, 365 F.2d 389, \n392 (2d Cir. 1966); see also ISCR Case No. 03-22861 at 2-3 (App. Bd. Jun. 2, 2006).  \n \nThere is some evidence in favor of mitigating Applicant\u2019s financial concerns. \nApplicant is a 51-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has been serving as a \nsystem administrator with his current employer since August 2017. He attended a \nvocational or technical school for several months in late 2008, but he did not receive a \ndiploma. He enlisted in the Inactive Naval Reserve in March 1986, and served until he \nwas honorably discharged in May 1991.  \n \nThe disqualifying evidence under the whole-person concept is simply more \nsubstantial. Applicant failed to timely file his federal and state income tax returns for the \ntax years 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014, and 2015. He failed to offer any evidence that he has \ndone so, even after he received the SOR. He also had a number of delinquent accounts \nthat were seemingly ignored by him, including accounts as small as under $150. Applicant \n\n \n10 \n                                      \n \nclaimed that he had made payments to some of his creditors, or entered into repayment \nagreements with other creditors. However, because of his failure to submit documentation \nassociated with his delinquent accounts, it is difficult to assess the true financial situation, \nfor we have mostly Applicant\u2019s unverified comments claiming that he had taken certain \nactions.  \n \nIn ISCR Case No. 07-06482 at 2-3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008), the Appeal Board \naddressed a key element in the analysis in financial cases stating: \n \nIn evaluating Guideline F cases, the Board has previously noted that the \nconcept of \u201cmeaningful track record\u201d necessarily includes evidence of actual \ndebt reduction through payment of debts. However, an applicant is not \nrequired, as a matter of law, to establish that he [or she] has paid off each \nand every debt listed in the SOR. All that is required is that an applicant \ndemonstrate that he [or she] has \u201c. . . established a plan to resolve his [or \nher] financial problems and taken significant actions to implement that plan.\u201d \nThe Judge can reasonably consider the entirety of an applicant\u2019s financial \nsituation and his [or her] actions in evaluating the extent to which that \napplicant\u2019s plan for the reduction of his outstanding indebtedness is credible \nand realistic. See Directive \u00b6 E2.2(a) (\u201cAvailable, reliable information about \nthe person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, should be \nconsidered in reaching a determination.\u201d) There is no requirement that a \nplan provide for payments on all outstanding debts simultaneously. Rather, \na reasonable plan (and concomitant conduct) may provide for the payment \nof such debts one at a time. Likewise, there is no requirement that the first \ndebts actually paid in furtherance of a reasonable debt plan be the ones \nlisted in the SOR. \n \nWhile Applicant contended that he took certain actions with respect to his \ndelinquent debts, as well as his delinquent federal and state income tax returns, there is \nno documentary evidence to indicate that any of those accounts have been addressed or \ntax returns filed. Applicant\u2019s current track record is poor at best. Overall, the evidence \nleaves me with substantial questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability \nfor a security clearance. For all of these reasons, I conclude Applicant has failed to \nmitigate the security concerns arising from his financial considerations. See SEAD 4, App. \nA, \u00b6\u00b6 2(d)(1) through AG 2(d)(9). \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a. through 1.g.:  \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.h.:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.i. through 1.n.:  \nAgainst Applicant \n\n \n11 \n                                      \n \nConclusion \n \n \n In light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n                                        \n         \n \n \n \n________________________ \nROBERT ROBINSON GALES \nAdministrative Judge \n",

Dorsey, Esquire, Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro se \n10/07/2019\n______________ \nDecision \n______________ \nGALES, Robert Robinson, Administrative Judge: \nApplicant failed to mitigate the security concerns regarding financial \nconsiderations. Eligibility for a security clearance is denied. \nStatement of the Case \nOn March 28, 2018, Applicant applied for a security clearance and submitted an \nElectronic Questionnaires for Investigations Processing (e-QIP) version of a Security \nClearance Application. On April 17, 2019, the Department of Defense (DOD) \nConsolidated Adjudications Facility (CAF) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to him, \nunder Executive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \nIndustry (February 20, 1960), as amended and modified; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense \nIndustrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended \nand modified (Directive); and Directive 4 of the Security Executive Agent (SEAD 4), \nNational Security Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) (December 10, 2016), for all covered \nindividuals who require initial or continued eligibility for access to classified information or \neligibility to hold a sensitive position, effective June 8, 2017. \n\n \n2 \n                                      \n \n The SOR alleged security concerns under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) \nand detailed reasons why the DOD adjudicators were unable to find that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant. \nThe SOR recommended referral to an administrative judge to determine whether a \nclearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked.  \n \n \nIn a sworn statement dated May 9, 2019, Applicant responded to the SOR and \nelected to have his case decided on the written record in lieu of a hearing. A complete \ncopy of the Government\u2019s file of relevant material (FORM) was mailed to Applicant by \nDOHA on June 4, 2019, and he was afforded an opportunity after receipt of the FORM to \nfile objections and submit material in refutation, extenuation, or mitigation. In addition to \nthe FORM, Applicant was furnished a copy of the Directive as well as the Adjudicative \nGuidelines applicable to his case. Applicant received the FORM on July 10, 2019. His \nresponse was due on August 9, 2019. Applicant chose not to respond to the FORM, for \nas of September 6, 2019, no response had been received. The case was assigned to me \non September 6, 2019.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nIn his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted, without comments, all of the factual \nallegations pertaining to financial considerations in the SOR (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a. and 1.b.). \nApplicant\u2019s admissions are incorporated herein as findings of fact. After a complete and \nthorough review of the evidence in the record, and upon due consideration of same, I \nmake the following additional findings of fact:  \n \nApplicant is a 46-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has been serving \nas an aerospace technician with his current employer since September 2011. He \npreviously worked as a sheet metal mechanic and programmer from January 2005 until \nNovember 2010, and he was unemployed from November 2010 until September 2011. \nHis educational background was not reported. He has never served with the U.S. military.  \nHe has never held a secret clearance. Applicant has never been married, and he has no \nchildren.  \n \nFinancial Considerations \n \nGeneral source information pertaining to the financial accounts discussed below \ncan be found in the following exhibits: Item 2 (Answer to the SOR, dated May 9, 2019); \nItem 3 (e-QIP, dated March 28, 2018); and Item 4 (Enhanced Subject Interview, dated \nOctober 31, 2018). \nAs of April 17, 2019, Applicant failed to file both his federal and state income tax \nreturns for the tax years 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014, 2015, 2016, and 2017. (Item 2) He \nattributed his inaction to being financially irresponsible and disorganized, and he \nexplained that he had lost all of his tax-related documents. (Item 4, at 4-7) During an \ninterview with an investigator from the U.S. Office of Personnel Management (OPM) on \nOctober 31, 2018, Applicant stated that he is not unwilling or unable to satisfy his tax \ndebts, but he acknowledged that he had not made any progress towards doing so. (Item \n\n \n3 \n                                      \n \n4, at 4-7) He also acknowledged that he did not have an agreement with the Internal \nRevenue Service (IRS) to pay the federal taxes that he may owe. (Item 4, at 4-7) It was \nApplicant\u2019s intention to engage the services of an attorney to assist him. (Item 3, at 26-\n28; Item 4, at 4-7) To date, Applicant has submitted no evidence to indicate that: he has \ncontacted the IRS or the state revenue department; he has contacted an attorney to assist \nhim; or he has filed any delinquent federal or state income tax return.  \nThere is a legal requirement to file a federal income tax return, and it is based upon \nan individual\u2019s gross income and other enumerated conditions. Once it is determined, \nunder 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7203, Willful failure to file return, supply information, or pay tax, that there is an \nobligation to so file, the following applies: \nAny person required under this title to pay any estimated tax or tax, or \nrequired by this title or by regulations made under authority thereof to make \na return, keep any records, or supply any information, who willfully fails to \npay such estimated tax or tax, make such return, keep such records, or \nsupply such information, at the time or times required by law or regulations, \nshall, in addition to other penalties provided by law, be guilty of a \nmisdemeanor and, upon conviction thereof, shall be fined not more than \n$25,000 ($100,000 in the case of a corporation), or imprisoned not more \nthan 1 year, or both, together with the costs of prosecution. In the case of \nany person with respect to whom there is a failure to pay any estimated tax, \nthis section shall not apply to such person with respect to such failure if \nthere is no addition to tax under section 6654 or 6655 with respect to such \nfailure. In the case of a willful violation of any provision of section 6050I, the \nfirst sentence of this section shall be applied by substituting \"felony\" for \n\"misdemeanor\" and \"5 years\" for \"1 year.\" \nThere is no evidence that Applicant made any efforts to address his delinquent \ntaxes, despite having made promises in his March 2018 e-QIP and October 2018 OPM \ninterview that he would do so. It is not known what Applicant\u2019s current financial resources \nmay be because he did not report his current net monthly income; monthly expenses; and \nany monthly remainder that might be available for discretionary spending or savings.  \nPolicies \n \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the Executive \nBranch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security emphasizing, \n\u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d (Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. \n518, 528 (1988)) As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to control \naccess to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual \nis sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information. The President has \nauthorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant an applicant eligibility for \naccess to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to do so.\u201d (Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \nIndustry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified.)     \n \n\n \n4 \n                                      \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the guidelines in SEAD 4. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the guidelines list potentially disqualifying \nconditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility \nfor access to classified information. \n \nAn administrative judge need not view the guidelines as inflexible, ironclad rules \nof law. Instead, acknowledging the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. The entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known \nas the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a meaningful decision. \n \nIn the decision-making process, facts must be established by \u201csubstantial \nevidence.\u201d \u201cSubstantial evidence [is] such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might \naccept as adequate to support a conclusion in light of all contrary evidence in the record.\u201d  \n(ISCR Case No. 04-11463 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2006) (citing Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1))  \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d  (See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994)) \n \nThe Government initially has the burden of producing evidence to establish a \npotentially disqualifying condition under the Directive, and has the burden of establishing \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Once the Government has produced substantial \nevidence of a disqualifying condition, under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant has the \nburden of persuasion to present evidence in refutation, explanation, extenuation or \nmitigation, sufficient to overcome the doubts raised by the Government\u2019s case. The \nburden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government. (See ISCR \nCase No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005)) \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours as well. It is \nbecause of this special relationship that the Government must be able to repose a high \ndegree of trust and confidence in those individuals to whom it grants access to classified \ninformation. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the \napplicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. Such \ndecisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather \nthan actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Furthermore, \u201csecurity clearance \ndeterminations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d (Egan, 484 U.S. at 531) \n \nClearance decisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense \nbe a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d (See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 \n7) Thus, nothing in this decision should be construed to suggest that I have based this \ndecision, in whole or in part, on any express or implied determination as to Applicant\u2019s \nallegiance, loyalty, or patriotism. It is merely an indication the Applicant has or has not \n\n \n5 \n                                      \n \nmet the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for \nissuing a clearance.  In reaching this decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that \nare reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I \nhave avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG \u00b6 18:  \n      \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19:  \n \n(a) inability to satisfy debts;  \n \n(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so;  \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \n \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay annual federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired. \n \nThe SOR alleged that Applicant failed to file federal and state income tax returns \nfor the tax years 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014, 2015, 2016, and 2017. As of April 17, 2019, \nnone of those income tax returns had been filed. AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(c) and 19(f) have been \nestablished. There is no evidence that Applicant has an inability to satisfy his debts or \nthat he has been unwilling to satisfy his debts regardless of an ability to do so. \nAccordingly, and AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and 19(b) have not been established.  \n \n\n \n6 \n                                      \n \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns arising from financial difficulties under AG \u00b6 20: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n  \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority \nto file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \n \nNone of the mitigating conditions apply. The nature, frequency, and recency of \nApplicant\u2019s continuing failure to file his federal and state income tax returns for the tax \nyears 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014, 2015, 2016, and 2017, make it rather easy to conclude \nthat it was not infrequent and it is likely to remain unchanged, much like it has been for \nnearly the past decade. Applicant attributed his inaction to being financially irresponsible \nand disorganized, and he explained that he had lost all of his tax-related documents. In \n2018, he indicated that he would take certain corrective actions, but now, ten months into \n2019, he has submitted no evidence that any of those actions have even commenced. \nApplicant failed repeatedly to fulfill his legal obligations with respect to filing his federal \nand state income tax returns, and by failing to do so, he does not demonstrate the high \ndegree of good judgment and reliability required of those granted access to classified \ninformation. \n \nThe DOHA Appeal Board has observed:  \n \nFailure to file tax returns suggests that an applicant has a problem with \ncomplying with well-established governmental rules and systems. Voluntary \ncompliance with such rules and systems is essential for protecting classified \ninformation. ISCR Case No. 01-05340 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 20, 2002). As we \nhave noted in the past, a clearance adjudication is not directed at collecting \ndebts. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 07-08049 at 5 (App. Bd. Jul. 22, 2008). By \nthe same token, neither is it directed toward inducing an applicant to file tax \nreturns. Rather, it is a proceeding aimed at evaluating an applicant\u2019s \njudgment and reliability. Id. A person who fails repeatedly to fulfill his or her \nlegal obligations does not demonstrate the high degree of good judgment \nand reliability required of those granted access to classified information. \nSee, e.g., ISCR Case No. 14-01894 at 5 (App. Bd. Aug. 18, 2015). See \n\n \n7 \n                                      \n \nCafeteria & Restaurant Workers Union Local 473 v. McElroy, 284 F.2d 173, \n183 (D.C. Cir. 1960), aff\u2019d, 367 U.S. 886 (1961).  \n \nISCR Case No. 14-04437 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 15, 2016). See ISCR Case No. 14-05476 \nat 5 (App. Bd. Mar. 25, 2016) (citing ISCR Case No. 01-05340 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 20, \n2002)); ISCR Case No. 14-01894 at 4-5 (App. Bd. Aug. 18, 2015). \n \nClearance decisions are aimed at evaluating an applicant\u2019s judgment, reliability, \nand trustworthiness. They are not a debt-collection procedure. The guidelines do not \nrequire an applicant to establish resolution of every debt or issue alleged in the SOR. An \napplicant needs only to establish a plan to resolve financial problems and take significant \nactions to implement the plan. There is no requirement that an applicant immediately \nresolve issues or make payments on all delinquent debts simultaneously, nor is there a \nrequirement that the debts or issues alleged in an SOR be resolved first. Rather, a \nreasonable plan and concomitant conduct may provide for the payment of such debts, or \nresolution of such issues, one at a time. Mere promises to resolve financial issues in the \nfuture, without further confirmed action, are insufficient.  \nThe Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a good-faith effort to \nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts: \nIn order to qualify for application of [the \u201cgood-faith\u201d mitigating condition], an \napplicant must present evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or some other good-faith action aimed at resolving the \napplicant\u2019s debts. The Directive does not define the term \u201cgood-faith.\u201d \nHowever, the Board has indicated that the concept of good-faith \u201crequires \na showing that a person acts in a way that shows reasonableness, \nprudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.\u201d Accordingly, an \napplicant must do more than merely show that he or she relied on a legally \navailable option (such as bankruptcy [or statute of limitations]) in order to \nclaim the benefit of [the \u201cgood-faith\u201d mitigating condition].  \n \n(internal citation and footnote omitted) ISCR Case No. 02-30304 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 20, \n2004) (quoting ISCR Case No. 99-9020 at 5-6 (App. Bd. June 4, 2001) \n \nApplicant\u2019s actions, or inaction, under the circumstances cast doubt on his current \nreliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. (See ISCR Case No. 09-08533 at 3-4 \n(App. Bd. Oct. 6, 2010).) \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6 2(d): \n  \n\n \n8 \n                                      \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nUnder SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. Moreover, I have \nevaluated the various aspects of this case in light of the totality of the record evidence \nand have not merely performed a piecemeal analysis. (See U.S. v. Bottone, 365 F.2d \n389, 392 (2d Cir. 1966); See also ISCR Case No. 03-22861 at 2-3 (App. Bd. Jun. 2, 2006))  \nThere is some evidence in favor of mitigating Applicant\u2019s financial concerns. \nApplicant is a 46-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has been serving as an \naerospace technician with his current employer since September 2011. He previously \nworked as a sheet metal mechanic and programmer from January 2005 until November \n2010.  \nThe disqualifying evidence under the whole-person concept is simply more \nsubstantial. Applicant failed to file federal and state income tax returns for the tax years \n2011, 2012, 2013, 2014, 2015, 2016, and 2017. As of April 17, 2019, none of those income \ntax returns had been filed. Furthermore, Applicant has submitted no evidence regarding \nany completed efforts to resolve his financial issues; no personal background information \nabout himself; and no information regarding his work background and performance.  \nOverall, the evidence leaves me with substantial questions and doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all of these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant has failed to mitigate the security concerns arising from his financial \nconsiderations. See SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6\u00b6 2(d)(1) through AG 2(d)(9). \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a. and 1.b.: \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \n\n \n9 \n                                      \n \nConclusion \n \n \n In light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n                                        \n         \n \n \n \n________________________ \nROBERT ROBINSON GALES \nAdministrative Judge \n",

Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nApplicant submitted a security clearance application on June 11, 2018. On May 3, \n2019, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications Facility (DOD CAF) sent \nher a Statement of Reasons (SOR) alleging security concerns under Guideline F. The \nDOD CAF acted under Executive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, \nDefense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as \namended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated in Security \nExecutive Agent Directive 4, National Security Adjudicative Guidelines (December 10, \n2016). \n \n \nApplicant answered the SOR in an undated document, and requested a hearing \nbefore an administrative judge. Department Counsel was ready to proceed on August 16, \n2019, and the case was assigned to me on August 26, 2019. On August 27, 2019, the \n\n \n2 \n \nDefense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) notified Applicant that the hearing was \nscheduled for September 24, 2019. I convened the hearing as scheduled. Government \nExhibits (GX) 1 through 6 were admitted in evidence without objection. Applicant testified \nand submitted Applicant\u2019s Exhibit (AX) A, which was admitted without objection. DOHA \nreceived the transcript (Tr.) on October 7, 2019. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn Applicant\u2019s answer to the SOR, she admitted all the allegations. Her admissions \nin her answer and at the hearing are incorporated in my findings of fact.  \n \n \nApplicant is a 27-year-old ship insulator employed by a defense contractor since \nJanuary 2018. She graduated from high school in June 2010 and attended college from \nDecember 2010 to April 2011, but did not receive a degree. She worked at numerous \nnon-government jobs until she was hired by her current employer. Applicant earned about \n$12 per hour in her previous jobs, but her pay increased to about $21 per hour when she \nbegan working for a defense contractor. She has never married and has no children. She \nhas never held a security clearance. \n \n \nAfter graduating from high school, Applicant initially lived with her mother and \ndrove her mother\u2019s car. She moved back and forth between her mother\u2019s home and her \ngrandmother\u2019s home because of her mother\u2019s drug problems. She moved into an \napartment with a roommate in November 2011. She moved back with her grandmother \nin September 2017 and was living with her grandmother when she submitted her security \nclearance application. She was living in her own apartment when she was interviewed by \na security investigator in November 2018.  \n \n \nApplicant incurred substantial debts when she bought furniture for her apartment \nand purchased a car from a private seller, which turned out to be a \u201clemon.\u201d She was \nunable to recoup any money from the seller, but she was liable for the loan she obtained \nto purchase the car. She was unable to pay for the furniture she purchased, and the seller \ngarnished her pay. She was unable to pay her state income taxes of about $755 for 2014 \nand about $100 for 2016. She also owed city property taxes on her car, which she \nneglected to pay because she was accustomed to driving her mother\u2019s car and depending \non her mother to pay the taxes. At the time of the hearing, she was driving a nine-year-\nold car with mileage of more than 124,000 miles, for which she owed about $12,000. \n \n \nApplicant filed a petition for Chapter 13 bankruptcy in July 2018, because her pay \nwas being garnished by the furniture dealer, making it impossible for her to pay her current \nbills. (Tr. 24.) She completed the required credit counseling as soon as she filed her \npetition. Her Chapter 13 plan was confirmed in September 2018. The tax debts are \nincluded in the bankruptcy as priority debts that will be paid first. The plan requires \nApplicant to pay $500 per month.  \n \n \nApplicant acknowledged at the hearing that she appeared to have decided to file \nthe bankruptcy petition after she filed her application for a security clearance. She \n\n \n3 \n \nexplained that she had contacted a bankruptcy attorney and began the process earlier in \nthe year, but that the petition was not filed until July 12, 2018, about a month after she \napplied for a security clearance. (Tr. 22.) \n \nIn March 2019, the bankruptcy trustee filed a motion to dismiss the bankruptcy \nbecause it was underfunded in light of the amounts claimed for federal, state, and local \ntaxes and her auto loan. The payment plan was modified and confirmed in June 2019.The \nmodified plan retained the provision for monthly $500 payments but extended the duration \nof the payment plan. (GX 6.)  \n \nApplicant has been making payments since October 2018. She missed a payment \nin November 2018 and paid less than the full amount in December 2018 and January \n2019, but she made up the shortfall by increasing the payments for February through \nApril 2019. (AX A.) She testified that she fell behind on her payments because she was \nin her first year on the job and was not paid for the days when the shipyard was shut down \nfor the holidays. (Tr. 26.) \n \n \nAt the time Applicant\u2019s bankruptcy plan was approved, her net monthly income \nwas about $3,091 and her monthly expenses were about $2,591, leaving a net monthly \nremainder of $500, the amount she is required to pay the bankruptcy trustee. (GX 6, \nBankruptcy Schedule J at 34.) She received a pay raise in April 2019. (Tr. 41.) She usually \nworks six days a week, and her pay sometimes increases when she works more overtime. \nIf she is granted a security clearance, she will be eligible for positions of greater \nresponsibility and increased pay. (Tr. 22, 40.) \n \nPolicies \n \n \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 2.  \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge \napplies these guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \n \n \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \n\n \n4 \n \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \n\u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \n \n \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 15-01253 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2016).   \n \n \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, \nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-\n31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).  \n \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-\n20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \n \nThe SOR alleges that Applicant filed a Chapter 13 bankruptcy petition in July 2018, \nlisting liabilities totaling about $48,770 (SOR \u00b6 1.a). The debts listed in the petition include \na $14,263 student loan on which payments are deferred. The SOR also alleges that \nApplicant owes about $755 in state taxes for tax year 2014 and city taxes totaling about \n$355 for tax years 2017 and 2018 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b and 1.c). The security concern under this \nguideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18:  \n \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \n\n \n5 \n \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. . . . An individual who is financially \noverextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or otherwise \nquestionable acts to generate funds. . . .  \n \n \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified information to raise money. It encompasses concerns about a \nperson\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting classified \ninformation. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information. See ISCR \nCase No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s admissions and the documentary evidence submitted at the hearing \nestablish the following disqualifying conditions under this guideline: \n \nAG \u00b6 19(a): inability to satisfy debts; \n \nAG \u00b6 19(c): a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \n \nAG \u00b6 19(f): failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local \nincome tax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax as required. \n \nThe following mitigating conditions are potentially applicable:  \n \nAG \u00b6 20(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not \ncast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \nAG \u00b6 20(b): the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \nAG \u00b6 20(c): the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling \nfor the problem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit \ncredit counseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem \nis being resolved or is under control; \n \nAG \u00b6 20(d): the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to \nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n \n\n \n6 \n \nAG \u00b6 20(g): the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax \nauthority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(a) is not established. Applicant\u2019s delinquent debts are numerous, recent, \nand were not incurred under circumstances making them unlikely to recur. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(b) is established. Applicant\u2019s underemployment and her na\u00efve purchase \nof a \u201clemon\u201d vehicle from a private seller were conditions largely beyond her control. She \nhas acted responsibly by filing a Chapter 13 bankruptcy petition and complying with the \npayment plan. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(c) is established. Applicant completed the credit counseling required by \nthe bankruptcy court, and her financial problems are being resolved. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(d) is established. Applicant has complied with the Chapter 13 payment \nplan for the past year. It is well established that an applicant who waits until his or her \napplication for a security clearance is in jeopardy before resolving debts may be lacking \nin the judgment expected of those with access to classified information.  See e.g., ISCR \nCase No. 16-01211 (App. Bd. May 30, 2018). However, Applicant contacted a bankruptcy \nattorney and began preparing for her bankruptcy petition before she applied for a security \nclearance. Her primary motivation was to gain financial stability, regardless of whether \nher application for a security clearance was granted. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(g) is partially established. Applicant did not contact the federal, state, and \nlocal authorities about her tax debts. However, she included her tax debts in her Chapter \n13 payment plan, and there is no evidence that the tax authorities objected to being \nincluded in her bankruptcy. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-\nperson concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process \nfactors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n\n \n7 \n \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \n \nI have incorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. \nSome of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were addressed under that guidelines, but some warrant \nadditional comment. Applicant has lived on her own since graduating from high school. \nShe came to the hearing well prepared, and her testimony was candid, thorough, and \ncredible. After weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under Guideline F, and \nevaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude that she has \nmitigated the security concerns raised by her delinquent debts. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F (Financial Considerations): FOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.c: \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nI conclude that it is clearly consistent with the national security interests of the \nUnited States to grant Applicant eligibility for access to classified information.

Corrales, Esq., Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro se \n08/19/2019 \nDecision \nLYNCH, Noreen A., Administrative Judge: \nThis case involves security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial \nConsiderations). Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nStatement of the Case \nApplicant submitted a security clearance application (SCA) on October 4, 2017. \nOn April 12, 2019, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications Facility (DOD \nCAF) sent him a Statement of Reasons (SOR) alleging security concerns under Guideline \nF. The DOD CAF acted under Executive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and adjudicative guidelines (AG) implemented by the \nDOD on June 8, 2017. \n \nApplicant timely  answered the SOR and elected to have his case decided on the \nwritten record in lieu of a hearing. Department Counsel submitted the Government\u2019s file \nof relevant material (FORM) on July 1, 2019.  Applicant received the FORM on July 11, \n2019. The Government\u2019s evidence, included in the FORM, and identified as Items 1 \n\n2 \n \nthrough 4, is admitted without objection. Applicant provided a response to the FORM, \nwhich is marked as AX A.  The case was assigned to me on August 13, 2019. Based on \nmy review of the documentary evidence, I find that Applicant has not mitigated the \nfinancial considerations security concerns.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant is a 28-year-old employee of a federal contractor. He reported no military \nservice. Applicant obtained his GED in December 2008. (Item 3) He never married and \nhas no children.  He has not held a security clearance and is sponsored by the defense \ncontractor with whom he has been employed since July 2017. (Items 3, 4) He disclosed \nhis financial issues on his security clearance application. \n \nFinancial \n \n \nThe SOR alleges in 1.a-1.b that Applicant failed to file as required, Federal income \ntax returns for tax years 2015 and 2016 and failure to file, as required, state income tax \nreturns for tax years 2015 and 2016. (Item 1, 3, and 4) Applicant admitted the allegations \nlisted on the SOR. He  noted in his answer to the SOR, that he failed to file his 2014 \nincome tax returns. (Item 2) \n \n \nApplicant provided various reasons for not filing his income tax returns, to include, \nthat he prefers filing every three years, but in this case, he lost track of the years that he \nfiled. He blamed immaturity and not being organized, but stressed that he is now mature \nand takes full responsibility for his actions. Applicant stated that it will not occur again. \n(Item 2) \n \n \nOn Applicant\u2019s 2017, security clearance application he stated that he would file by \nthe end of that year. He noted that he was going through hard times financially, but he \ndid not elaborate. He stated that he paid his property taxes. He estimated that he owed \nabout $750 total for his income tax. (Item 3) For the year 2016, Applicant stated on his \nSCA that he never received his W-2 tax return in the mail, but believed he owed about \n$1,000. (Item 3) During his subject interview, Applicant also acknowledged failure to file \nthe required income tax returns, but would do so by the end of 2018. (Item 4) He stated \nthat his financial situation was \u201cpretty good,\u201d as he has a higher paying job. \n \n \n \nApplicant responded to the FORM and provided updated information about filings \nwith respect to SOR 1.a and 1.b. He recently submitted his income tax returns for the tax \nyears 2014-2018. He spoke to an IRS specialist and stated that he did not understand \nwhy the 2015, 2016, 2017 and 2018 were filed \u201call at once\u201d through a third party. He knew \nthat it was urgent to file his federal and state taxes after reading the subject interview and \nthe effect on a security clearance.  (Answer to FORM AX A) Applicant submitted client \ncopies of Federal income tax returns for tax years 2014, 2015, and  2016. The copies \nwere signed by the tax preparer on July 22, 2019, but they were not signed by Applicant. \nHe also submitted the state income tax returns for the same years. The record is not clear \nif the returns were actually filed or if the tax owed was paid. (AX A) \n\n3 \n \n \n \nApplicant also submitted information concerning his property tax payment and his \ncurrent credit score. He stated that he has also paid four collection accounts that were \nrecently on his credit report. (AX A) There is no information in the record concerning his \nsalary, financial counseling, or use of a budget. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nPolicies \n \n \n \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 2.  \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge \napplies these guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \n \n \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \n\u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \n \n \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \n\n4 \n \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 92-1106 at 3, \n1993 WL 545051 at *3 (App. Bd. Oct. 7, 1993).   \n \n \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, \nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-\n31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).  \n \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-\n20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F (Financial Considerations) \n \nThe concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \n \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds . . . .  \n \n \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified information to raise money. It encompasses concerns about a \nperson\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting classified \ninformation. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information. See ISCR \nCase No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s admissions and other documentation in the record reflect non-filing of \nFederal and state income tax returns for years 2014-2018. Three disqualifying conditions \nunder this guideline are established: AG \u00b6 19(a) (\u201cinability to satisfy debts\u201d), AG \u00b6 19(c) \n(\u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations\u201d), and AG 19(f) (\u201cfailure to file or fraudulently \nfiling annual Federal, state, or local income tax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, \nstate, or local income tax as required\u201d). \n \n \n\n5 \n \n \nThe security concerns raised in the SOR may be mitigated by any of the following \npotentially applicable factors: \n \nAG \u00b6 20(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not \ncast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \nAG \u00b6 20(b): the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \nAG \u00b6 20(c): the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling \nfor the problem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit \ncredit counseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem \nis being resolved or is under control; and \n \nAG \u00b6 20(d): the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to \nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \n \n \nApplicant provided various reasons for not filing his Federal and state income tax \nreturns. He admitted that he preferred to file every three years, but then became \ndisorganized and lost track of filings. He has not provided information on financial \ncounseling, his salary, or his actual filings or payments. In response to the FORM, \nApplicant submitted client copies of income tax returns for Federal and state signed by a \nthird party preparer, dated July 22, 2019. The documents were not signed by Applicant. \nIt is not possible to ascertain whether they were actually filed. He also did not have \ninformation to show that he paid any tax that was owed.  He has been steadily employed, \nbut according to the record has not taken action on the filings until 2019. On his 2017 \nSCA, he noted the failure to file and stated that all would be filed by the end of the year. \nHe was aware for at least two years of the tax issue, but did not make a good-faith effort \nuntil July 2019. Applicant has furnished insufficient information to meet his burden. None \nof the mitigating conditions apply. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-\nperson concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process \nfactors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n\n6 \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \n \nApplicant has never held a security clearance. He has worked for a number of \nyears as a contractor. He responded to the FORM, and admitted that he did not file his \nFederal or state income tax returns for the years in question. He did not provide solid \ninformation that the client copies of the Federal and state income tax returns were indeed \nfiled on July 22, 2019. He repeatedly failed to fulfill his legal obligations, as required by \nlaw. I find that he has not demonstrated good judgment or reliability.   \n \n \nThe record does not provide sufficient information to mitigate the security concerns \nin this case. Applicant provided various reasons for not filing the income tax returns, but \nnone of them are sufficient to mitigate the case. The information that he submitted does \nnot establish that the filngs are complete or that he has paid any tax owed. He did  provide \ninformation that he paid his property tax and several collection accounts.  Applicant has \nnot has mitigated the financial considerations security concerns. \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F (Financial Considerations): AGAINST APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.b \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant:  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national security interests of the \nUnited States to grant Applicant eligibility for access to classified information.

Applicant admitted the debts when he answered the SOR allegations. He indicated that a $749 collection debt (SOR \u00b6 1.a) had been brought current; that he would pay a $105 cable- services debt (SOR \u00b6 1.f) first; and would \u201cslowly knock off each [of the other] debts one at a time.\u201d After considering the pleadings, exhibits, and transcripts, I make the following findings of fact. Applicant is a 36-year-old high school graduate. He has been working for a defense contractor as a mechanical technician since June 2017. He held an interim secret clearance until it was withdrawn on issuance of the SOR. He does not currently hold a security clearance. (GEs 1-2; Tr. 29-30.)

He brought current a delinquent truck loan, and in July 2019 entered into a debt \nrepayment plan covering his larger debts, but he lacks a track record of timely payments \nthat could fully mitigate the financial considerations security concerns. Clearance is denied. \nStatement of the Case \n \nOn May 13, 2019, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications Facility \n(DOD CAF) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant, detailing security concerns \nunder Guideline F, financial considerations. The SOR explained why the DOD CAF was \nunable to find it clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue security- \nclearance eligibility for him. The DOD CAF took the action under Executive Order (EO) \n10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as \namended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review \nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the National Security Adjudicative \n\n2 \n \nGuidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information or Eligibility to \nHold a Sensitive Position (AG) effective within the DOD on June 8, 2017. \n \nOn May 21, 2019, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations and requested a \nhearing before an administrative judge from the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals \n(DOHA). On August 19, 2019, Department Counsel indicated that the Government was \nready to proceed to a hearing. On August 21, 2019, the case was assigned to me to \nconduct a hearing to determine whether it is clearly consistent with the national interest to \ngrant or continue a security clearance for Applicant. On August 28, 2019, I scheduled a \nhearing for September 25, 2019. \n \nAt the hearing held as scheduled, four Government exhibits (GEs 1-4) were \nadmitted in evidence without any objections.

I held \nthe record open after the hearing, initially to October 11, 2019, for documentary exhibits \nfrom Applicant. \n \nOn October 11, 2019, Applicant submitted a residential lease agreement, which was \nadmitted into evidence as Applicant exhibit (AE) A. In a separate email, which was \naccepted into the record as AE B, Applicant requested an extension of two weeks of the \ndeadline for post-hearing submissions. No additional documents were received by the \nOctober 25, 2019 deadline. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nThe SOR alleges under Guideline F that, as of the May 13, 2019 SOR, Applicant \nowed delinquent debts totaling $14,859 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.j) on ten accounts.

Applicant believes his employment will continue if \nhe is not granted security clearance eligibility, but that his opportunity for advancement will \nbe hampered without a clearance. (Tr. 30.) \n \nApplicant and his longtime girlfriend have lived together since March 2002. (GE 1.) \nThey have two sons ages one and four. (GE 1; Tr. 28.) Applicant and his girlfriend lived \nwith his mother until September 2012. It is unclear whether Applicant was employed for the \ntwo years following his high school graduation in June 2002. Applicant worked full-time in \nelectromechanical assembly for a video systems company from June 2004 to June 2007 \n\n3 \n \nand then as a contractor for another company until August 2008, when the contract ended. \nApplicant was unemployed from August 2008 to April 2009. (GE 1.) \n \nIn April 2009, Applicant began working full time as an assembler and machine \noperator for a technology company. In November 2012, Applicant purchased a home, \nobtaining a mortgage loan of $235,653, then to be repaid at $1,946 per month. He \nstruggled to make his mortgage payments and stopped paying on some credit-card \naccounts in 2013 and 2014. After he was laid off from his job of five years in May 2014, \nApplicant was unemployed until November 2016. (GE 1.) He was supported by his \ngirlfriend, who works as an administrative assistant. She supplemented her income at that \ntime by doing nails for clients out of their house (Tr. 58), but several accounts went unpaid. \n(GEs 2-3.) Applicant had convinced his mother to take out a $100,000 home-equity loan to \ninvest in a car dealership business started by one of Applicant\u2019s cousins. Applicant decided \nto work for his cousin so that he could monitor his mother\u2019s financial investment. \nApplicant\u2019s cousin failed to pay him any income, even though he had been promised a \npaycheck of $300 a week. Applicant finally decided to look for a job elsewhere. (Tr. 39-42.) \n \nIn June 2016, Applicant obtained a loan of $25,532 for a 2012 model-year truck. \nThe loan required repayment at $472 per month (SOR \u00b6 1.a). (GE 4; Tr. 33.) The truck is \ncurrently Applicant and his spouse\u2019s only vehicle. (Tr. 33.) \n \nOn November 15, 2016, Applicant completed a Questionnaire for National Security \nPositions (SF 86) for a job as a wire-bonder with a company contracted to provide services \nfor Applicant\u2019s current employer. On the SF 86, Applicant indicated that his employment \nwas contingent on obtaining an interim secret clearance. He disclosed no issues of \npotential security concern on his SF 86. (GEs 1-2.) \n \n \nA check of Applicant\u2019s credit on March 23, 2017, revealed several outstanding \ndelinquencies, including credit-card judgment debts of $1,870 from October 2014 (SOR \u00b6 \n1.d) and $1,129 (SOR \u00b6 1.e) from June 2015. His joint mortgage loan was $7,970 past due \non a balance of $216,704 (not alleged). Credit cards had been charged off for $6,945 in \nMarch 2014 (SOR \u00b6 1.b), $829 in February 2014 (SOR \u00b6 1.g), and $231 in July 2014 (SOR \n\u00b6 1.h). A cellular phone debt of $216 from April 2015 had also been charged off (SOR \u00b6 \n1.i). A credit-card debt of $1,915 from April 2013 (SOR \u00b6 1.c) was placed for collection in \nMarch 2016 (SOR \u00b6 1.c). A $442 wireless phone debt from April 2011 was assigned for \ncollection in December 2015 (SOR \u00b6 1.j). A $105 cable services debt from December 2014 \nwas placed for collection in December 2016 (SOR \u00b6 1.f). (GE 3.) \n \n \nApplicant had no record of late payments on an automobile loan obtained for \n$20,646 in September 2011. He used his credit to buy a vehicle for his mother, and she \ngave him the money to make the $348 monthly payments. (GE 3; Tr. 53.) The car loan was \npaid off in September 2017. (GE 4.) \n \n \nIn June 2017, Applicant began working for his current employer. (GE 2.) On August \n20, 2018, Applicant was interviewed by an authorized investigator for the Office of \nPersonnel Management (OPM). While discussing his financial situation, Applicant \n\n4 \n \nvolunteered that he had several outstanding bills and collection accounts that he had not \ndisclosed on his SF 86 because he did not have the information needed to accurately \nreport the accounts. He did not dispute the adverse information on his credit record when \nconfronted, but could not recall details of the collection accounts. Applicant indicated that \nhe brought his mortgage loan up to date in October 2017 and was making timely \npayments. He claimed that the old cell phone debt with the creditor in SOR \u00b6 1.i had been \npaid off. As for the charged-off debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b, 1.d, 1.g, and 1.h, Applicant \nacknowledged them as his credit-card debts, which he hoped to pay off by the end of 2018. \nApplicant recognized the two credit-card judgment debts, which he likewise hoped to \nresolve by the end of 2018. Applicant explained that, after he was laid off in 2014, he \nturned to credit cards to pay for necessities and \u201cslowly fell behind.\u201d His intention was to \nsell his home in the next six months and pay off his delinquent debts. He had not sought \nfinancial counseling, but his financial situation was improving because of his full-time \nemployment. The investigator reportedly gave Applicant the opportunity to provide \ndocumentation about his delinquent accounts during and after his interview, but no \ndocumentation was submitted. (GE 2.) \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s girlfriend took time off from her job as an administrative assistant around \nthe birth of their second son in 2018. She returned to work, but only about 20 hours a \nweek, because her shift job was no longer available. (Tr. 33.) \n \n \nIn November 2018, Applicant and his girlfriend moved into a condominium. He was \nbehind on his electricity bill for his previous residence and has been paying extra to reduce \nhis delinquent balance. (Tr. 47-48.) No information was provided about the extent of his \nutility delinquency or his extra payments. \n \n \nIn December 2018, Applicant paid off his mortgage loan by selling his house. (GE 4; \nTr. 43-44.) Of his $75,000 in equity from the home sale, he gave his mother $70,000 to \nrepay her for the $100,000 she lost in the car dealership investment that he had \nencouraged. He deposited the remaining $5,000 in his savings account. (Tr. 45.) \n \n \nAs of January 2019, Applicant was $749 past due ($17,967 balance) on the truck \nloan obtained in June 2016 (SOR \u00b6 1.a). In 2017, he redeemed the truck from \nrepossession after being chronically late 30 to 60 days in his payments. (GE 4; Tr. 32.) \nEquifax was reporting no progress toward resolving the debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b-1.f and 1.h. \n(GE 4.) The $216 and $442 cell phone debts (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.i-1.j) were not on his credit report, \nbut they had not been paid. (Tr. 26.) \n \nOn May 13, 2019, the DOD CAF issued an SOR to Applicant, alleging delinquent \ndebt totaling $14,859. When he responded to the SOR allegations, Applicant did not \ndispute any of the delinquencies, but he indicated that he had brought his truck loan (SOR \n\u00b6 1.a) current. He expressed an intention to pay the $105 cable bill (SOR \u00b6 1.f) first, \nbecause it is the lowest, followed by the debts in SOR \u00b6 1.g ($829), SOR \u00b6 1.h ($231), and \nSOR \u00b6 1.i ($216) in that order. (Answer.) \n \n\n5 \n \nAt his September 2019 hearing, Applicant testified that he has been current on his \ntruck loan for the past five months; that in late July 2019, he entered into a debt repayment \nplan for the debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b-1.e under which he contracted to pay $265 a month for \ntwo years to a debt servicer; and that he has made two payments, those due in August \n2019 and September 2019. (Answer.) Because of their smaller balances, the debt servicer \ndid not want to deal with them. Applicant was to take care of the debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.f-1.j on \nhis own. He had not contacted the creditors as of September 2019. (Tr. 23-27, 31-33, 35.) \nWhen asked to explain his delay in addressing the smaller debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.f-1.j, \nApplicant responded: \n \nI just hadn\u2019t had the time, I guess. It just went over my head. I\u2019ve just, in my \nhead, I\u2019ve been thinking, like [the debt servicer is] going to take care of it, but \nthen I forget that, they\u2019re not handling the small bills. So that\u2019s my \nresponsibility, on my, on my sole self, to \u2014 you\u2019re right \u2014 call, to get in \ncontact with all these debt collectors and just clear all the little ones out of the \nway. (Tr. 36.)  \n \nApplicant\u2019s girlfriend just recently increased her work hours to 30 per week, which \nnets her $550 to $560 every two weeks. (Tr. 34, 49.)  Applicant has $5,500 in his savings \naccount for emergencies or unexpected repairs. (Tr. 37.) He maintains a balance of \napproximately $200 in his checking account to ensure that he has enough to cover those \nbills that are being paid through automatic deduction. (Tr. 38.) Applicant\u2019s take-home pay \nwas $600 a month or about $49,000 a year until August 2019, when he began working an \nextra 12 hours per week in overtime. (Tr. 59-60.) With overtime, he takes home $3,400 a \nmonth. (Tr. 46.) Applicant estimated that, after paying recurrent bills like his rent and truck \nloan, he has about $600 to $650 each month for other expenses, including gasoline for his \n\u201cgas-guzzler\u201d truck and the $265 to the debt servicer. (Tr. 55-56.) He and his girlfriend do \nnot currently have daycare expenses because his mother cares for their children when they \nare working. (Tr. 50-51.) Applicant received some budget counseling from the debt \nservices firm reportedly handling his debt repayment plan. (Tr. 54.) Apart from a $650 truck \nrepair bill for his truck in spring 2019, Applicant has not incurred any sizeable unexpected \nexpenses in the past year. (Tr. 60.) He testified that he had the funds to address the debts \nin SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.f ($105), 1.h ($231), and 1.i ($216). (Tr. 62.) \n \nIn October 2019, Applicant and his spouse renewed their lease for another year on \nthe townhouse they rent. (AE A.) He had to pay $3,800 because his landlord wanted the \nfirst and last months\u2019 rent. Because of that expense and the illness of a family member, he \nhad not paid any of the smaller debts excluded from the debt repayment plan. (AE B.) I \nextended the deadline for documentation to October 25, 2019, but no documents were \nreceived that could corroborate his compliance with his debt repayment plan or any efforts \nto repay the debts excluded from the plan. Applicant does not know whether any of his \ncreditors objected to inclusion in the debt repayment plan. Instead of a portion of his \npayments being split among his creditors, his creditors will be paid off one by one, starting \nwith his largest debt (SOR \u00b6 1.b). (Tr. 57.) \n  \n\n6 \n \n Applicant\u2019s tax refund for tax year 2018 was taken by the Internal Revenue Service \nto reduce his outstanding tax delinquency for tax year 2017 to its current $1,300. As of \nSeptember 2019, he had not considered taking some of his savings to pay off his tax debt. \n(Tr. 51-52.) On October 11, 2019, he indicated that he had that day contacted the IRS, \nmade a down payment toward his tax delinquency, and scheduled a monthly payment. (AE \nB.) He provided no details of the payment amounts, so it is unclear when that debt will be \nresolved. \n \nAs of October 2019, Applicant had taken no steps to address his smaller \ndelinquencies that he knew he had to address on his own. He explained that medical \nissues for his mother left him unable to focus on what he needed to get done to mitigate \nthe Government\u2019s security concerns.  \n \nPolicies \n \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion the Executive \nBranch has in regulating access to information pertaining to national security,  emphasizing \nthat \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 \nU.S. 518, 528 (1988). When evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, \nthe administrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are required to be considered in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. These guidelines \nare not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, \nthese guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative \nprocess. The administrative judge\u2019s overall adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious \nscrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative \njudge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, \nfavorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence \nto establish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant \nis responsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \n\n7 \n \nthat the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation about potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Section 7 of EO 10865 \nprovides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a \ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section \n3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information). \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \n \n \nThe security concerns about financial considerations are articulated in AG \u00b6 18: \n \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness \nto abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about an \nindividual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified or \nsensitive information. Financial distress can also be caused or exacerbated \nby, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other issues of personnel security \nconcern such as excessive gambling, mental health conditions, substance \nmisuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An individual who is financially \noverextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or otherwise \nquestionable acts to generate funds. . . . \n \n \nThe Appeal Board explained the scope and rationale for the financial considerations \nsecurity concern in ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012) (citation omitted) \nas follows: \n \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an applicant might knowingly \ncompromise classified information in order to raise money in satisfaction of \nhis or her debts. Rather, it requires a Judge to examine the totality of an \napplicant\u2019s financial history and circumstances. The Judge must consider \npertinent evidence regarding the applicant\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other \nqualities essential to protecting the national secrets as well as the \nvulnerabilities inherent in the circumstances. The Directive presumes a \nnexus between proven conduct under any of the Guidelines and an \napplicant\u2019s security eligibility. \n \nApplicant\u2019s credit reports of March 2017 and January 2019, and his admissions \nduring his August 2018 interview and in his SOR response, establish a record of financial \ndelinquency triggering three disqualifying conditions under AG \u00b6 19: \n \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; \n \n(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so; and \n \n\n8 \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s credit reports show that two creditors (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d and 1.e) obtained \nfinancial judgments against him in October 2014 and June 2015, respectively. In addition \nto the $14,859 in delinquent debt alleged in the SOR, Applicant admitted that he owes \napproximately $1,300 in income tax delinquency for tax year 2017. His income tax debt \ncannot be considered disqualifying because it was not alleged in the SOR. However, the \ndelinquency is relevant in assessing the applicability of a mitigating condition, evidence in \nreform, and Applicant\u2019s security clearance eligibility under the whole-person concept. \n \nApplicant bears the burdens of production and persuasion in mitigation. One or \nmore of the following conditions under AG \u00b6 20 may apply in whole or in part: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under \nsuch circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the \nindividual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem from a \nlegitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit counseling service, \nand there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under \ncontrol; \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue. \n \nWith the exception of the truck-loan delinquency in SOR \u00b6 1.a, the debts have been \ndelinquent for several years. Last reported activity on most of the SOR accounts was in \n2014. The cell phone debt in SOR \u00b6 1.j is from 2011. Nonetheless, AG \u00b6 20(a) cannot \nreasonably apply. Applicant was delinquent as recently as the fall of 2018 on his truck loan, \nwhich he apparently brought current by May 2019. As of the issuance of the SOR in May \n2019, Applicant had made no payments on his other delinquencies. The debts are \nconsidered recent because \u201can applicant\u2019s ongoing, unpaid debts evidence a continuing \ncourse of conduct and, therefore, can be viewed as recent for purposes of the Guideline F \nmitigating conditions.\u201d ISCR Case No. 15-06532 at 3 (App. Bd. Feb. 16, 2017) (citing ISCR \nCase No. 15-01690 at 2 (App. Bd. Sept. 13, 2016)). \n\n9 \n \n \nDuring his OPM interview in August 2018, Applicant explained that he slowly fell \nbehind on some financial obligations when he and his girlfriend were reduced to a one- \nincome family after he was laid off in 2014. Applicant gave a date of May 2014 for the start \nof his unemployment. Credit reports in evidence show that his largest credit-card \ndelinquency ($6,945) was charged off in March 2014; the $829 credit-card delinquency \nwas charged off in February 2014; and no payments had been made on the credit card in \nSOR \u00b6 1.c since April 2013. Nevertheless, his unexpected job loss was a factor in other \naccounts becoming seriously past due and in his inability to repay his past-due debts, \nalthough in that regard, Applicant bears some responsibility for the length of time without \nincome. It was his choice to stay at his cousin\u2019s car dealership despite no remuneration for \nhis work there. AG \u00b6 20(b) also has applicability because his household income suffered in \n2018 when his girlfriend stopped working temporarily after the birth of their second child. \nApplicant did not provide the dates for her pregnancy leave, but indicated that when she \nresumed working, it was only 20 hours per week because her shift was no longer available \nto her. \n  \nEven if Applicant\u2019s financial difficulties initially arose, in whole or in part, due to \ncircumstances outside of his control, I have to consider whether Applicant acted in a \nreasonable manner when dealing with his financial difficulties. See ISCR Case No. 05-\n11366 at 4, n.9 (App. Bd. Jan. 12, 2007) (citing ISCR Case No. 99-0462 at 4 (App. Bd. \nMay 25, 2000); ISCR Case No. 99-0012 at 4 (App. Bd. Dec. 1, 1999); ISCR Case No. 03-\n13096 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 29, 2005)). His evidence falls somewhat short in that regard. \nApplicant has been consistently employed by a defense contractor since June 2017. In \nAugust 2018, Applicant was placed on notice that his financial issues were of concern to \nthe DOD. With his house about to be sold, Applicant and his girlfriend began renting a \ntownhouse in November 2018. He had to come up with his first month\u2019s rent and security \ndeposit. However, he had $75,000 in equity in his house after he paid off his mortgage loan \nin December 2018. While he cannot be faulted for giving his mother $70,000 in partial \ncompensation for the $100,000 she lost investing in his cousin\u2019s car dealership business, \nhe still had the $5,000 in remaining equity in his checking account in September 2019. His \nexplanation for not using some of that money to pay those smaller delinquencies which had \nexcluded from his debt repayment plan established in late July 2019 is that he has not had \nthe time, and that he kept thinking the debt servicer would pay them. However, he knew \nthat the debts were not covered in the debt repayment plan. It was financially irresponsible \nof Applicant to continue to disregard those debts. I gave him an opportunity to submit post-\nhearing documentation of his efforts to contact some of his creditors and make repayment \narrangements. In October 2019, he requested an extension, which I granted, and yet he \nsubmitted no evidence of any payments or repayment arrangements of the three debts he \nindicated he would resolve (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.f, 1.h, and 1.1). He also exhibited poor judgment in \ndisregarding known court judgments against him. \n \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 20(c) and 20(d) have some applicability because Applicant brought his truck \nloan current. He also credibly testified that he arranged for repayment of his larger credit-\ncard delinquencies through a debt repayment plan in late July 2019 and that he made his \nfirst two payments under the plan. However, even when there has been some corrective \naction and an applicant is motivated to prevent such problems in the future, the \n\n10 \n \nadministrative judge is not precluded from considering an applicant\u2019s trustworthiness in \nlight of longstanding prior behavior evidencing irresponsibility. See e.g., ISCR Case No. 14-\n01894 at 5 (App. Bd. Aug. 2015). The Appeal Board reaffirmed that the timing of corrective \naction is an appropriate factor to consider in applying AG \u00b6 20(g). See e.g., ISCR Case No. \n17-01382 at 4 (App. Bd. May 16, 2018) (citing ISCR Case No. 17-01807 at 3-4 (App. Bd. \nMar. 7, 2018)). Applicant redeemed his truck from repossession and caught up on his loan \npayments before the SOR was issued, but he was clearly motivated to do so because it is \nthe family\u2019s only vehicle. There is no evidence that he took action to address any of his \nother debts before the SOR was issued. It suggests he may not take action until his \npersonal interests are imperiled. \n  \nThe Appeal Board has held that an applicant is not required to establish that he has \npaid off each debt in the SOR, or even that the first debts paid be those in the SOR. See \nISCR Case No. 07-06482 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008). Yet, the Appeal Board recently \nreiterated in ADP Case No. 17-0063 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2018) that \u201can applicant must \ndemonstrate a plan for debt repayment, accompanied by concomitant conduct, that is, \nconduct that evidences a serious intent to resolve the debts.\u201d Applicant presented no \ncorroborating documentation of his payment plan for the debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b-1.e and 1.g. \nHe testified that the debts will be paid off in two years under the plan. However, his present \npayment of $265 a month would not be enough to pay off even his largest credit-card debt \nof $6,945. It is unclear when his debts will be resolved. Although he apparently has had \nsome budget counseling, two or perhaps three payments of $265 as of October 2019 is not \nenough to reasonably conclude that his financial problems are under control. He has not \nshown good faith with regard to addressing his smaller debts not included in the debt \nrepayment plan. A promise to pay a debt at some future date is not a substitute for a track \nrecord of timely payments. The financial considerations security concerns are not \nadequately mitigated. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of his conduct and \nall relevant circumstances in light of the nine adjudicative process factors in AG \u00b6 2(d): \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances \nsurrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the \nfrequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at \nthe time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which participation is voluntary; (6) \nthe presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral \nchanges; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, \ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or \nrecurrence. \n \nSome of the adjudicative process factors were addressed under Guideline F, but \nsome warrant additional comment. There is no evidence of extravagant expenditure, but \nApplicant has yet to demonstrate the good judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness that \n\n11 \n \nclearance eligibility requires. Whether it be the birth of his second child, or lately his \nmother\u2019s health issues, personal circumstances have prevented or distracted him from \nfulfilling his responsibilities to his creditors and his promises to the Government. He was \ngiven an opportunity after his hearing to make good on his promises to address three of his \nsmaller debts, but he submitted no evidence in that regard. He asserted on October 11, \n2019, that he agreed to a repayment arrangement with the IRS for his delinquent income \ntaxes for tax year 2017, but provided no details or documentation of any arrangements to \naddress his tax delinquency.  \n \nThe security clearance assessment is a reasonable and careful evaluation of an \napplicant\u2019s circumstances and whether they cast doubt upon his judgment, self-control, and \nother characteristics essential to protecting national security information. It is well settled \nthat once a concern arises regarding an applicant\u2019s security-clearance eligibility, there is a \nstrong presumption against the grant or renewal of a security clearance. See Dorfmont v. \nBrown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th Cir. 1990). After applying the disqualifying and mitigating \nconditions to the evidence presented, I continue to have some doubts about Applicant\u2019s \nfinancial judgment and reliability. This does not mean that Applicant may not at some \nfuture date be able to establish that his financial problems are sufficiently resolved to \nwarrant clearance eligibility. I conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national \ninterest to grant security clearance eligibility for Applicant at this time. \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.b-1.j: \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n________________________ \nElizabeth M. Matchinski \nAdministrative Judge \n \n",

Eligibility for \na security clearance is granted. \nStatement of the Case \nOn July 14, 2017, Applicant applied for a security clearance and submitted a \nQuestionnaire for National Security Positions (SF 86). On April 16, 2019, the Department \nof Defense (DOD) Consolidated Adjudications Facility (CAF) issued a Statement of \nReasons (SOR) to him, under Executive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended and modified; \nDOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program \n(January 2, 1992), as amended and modified (Directive); and Directive 4 of the Security \nExecutive Agent (SEAD 4), National Security Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) (December \n10, 2016), for all covered individuals who require initial or continued eligibility for access \nto classified information or eligibility to hold a sensitive position, effective June 8, 2017. \n\n \n2 \n                                      \n \nThe SOR alleged security concerns under Guideline B (Foreign Influence), and \ndetailed reasons why the DOD adjudicators were unable to find that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant. The SOR \nrecommended referral to an administrative judge to determine whether a clearance \nshould be granted, continued, denied, or revoked.  \n \n \nIn a sworn statement dated May 15, 2019, Applicant responded to the SOR, and \nhe elected to have his case decided on the written record in lieu of a hearing. A complete \ncopy of the Government\u2019s file of relevant material (FORM) was mailed to Applicant by the \nDefense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) on July 29, 2019, and he was afforded \nan opportunity after receipt of the FORM to file objections and submit material in \nrefutation, extenuation, or mitigation. In addition to the FORM, Applicant was furnished a \ncopy of the Directive as well as the Adjudicative Guidelines applicable to his case. \nApplicant received the FORM on August 12, 2019. His response was due on September \n11, 2019. Applicant did not submit any response to the FORM. The case was assigned \nto me on October 16, 2019.  \n \nRulings on Procedure \n \nDepartment Counsel requested that I take administrative notice of certain \nenumerated facts pertaining to the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) appearing in 18 \nU.S. Government publications which were identified, but only fragments of extracts of \nthose publications were attached to the request. Additionally, Department Counsel \nrequested that I take administrative notice of certain enumerated facts pertaining to the \nRepublic of China (Taiwan) appearing in eight U.S. Government publications which were \nidentified, but only fragments of extracts of those publications were attached to the \nrequest. Facts are proper for administrative notice when they are easily verifiable by an \nauthorized source and relevant and material to the case.  \n \nAdministrative or official notice is the appropriate type of notice used for \nadministrative proceedings. See McLeod v. Immigration and Naturalization Service, 802 \nF.2d 89, 93 n.4 (3d Cir. 1986); ISCR Case No. 05-11292 at 4 n.1 (App. Bd. Apr. 12, 2007); \nISCR Case No. 02-24875 at 2 (App. Bd. Oct. 12, 2006) (citing ISCR Case No. 02-18668 \nat 3 (App. Bd. Feb. 10, 2004)). The most common basis for administrative notice at ISCR \nproceedings is to notice facts that are either well known or from government reports. See \nStein, Administrative Law, Section 25.01 (Bender & Co. 2006) (listing fifteen types of facts \nfor administrative notice). Requests for administrative notice may utilize authoritative \ninformation or sources from the internet. See, e.g. Hamdan v. Rumsfeld, 548 U.S. 557 \n(2006) (citing internet sources for numerous documents). In this instance, although \nDepartment Counsel has selected only certain pages of facts appearing in the identified \npublications, I have not limited myself to only those facts, but have considered the \npublications in their entirety. \n \nThe seven press releases from the U.S. Department of Justice were presented \napparently to substantiate that PRC and Taiwan actively pursue collection of U.S. \neconomic and propriety information, and, therefore, Applicant\u2019s relationships with his \n\n \n3 \n                                      \n \nvarious family members in Taiwan raises suspicion of him. The cases cited do not involve \nApplicant personally, nor do they involve espionage through any familial relationship. The \nanecdotal evidence of criminal wrongdoing of other U.S. citizens or foreign nationals is of \ndecreased relevance to an assessment of Applicant\u2019s security suitability, especially where \nthere is no evidence that Applicant, or any member of his family, was ever involved in any \naspect of the cited cases or ever targeted by any PRC or Taiwanese intelligence officials. \nFurthermore, the press releases are little more than a self-congratulatory public relations \nproducts issued by a public relations office, with the collateral effect of deterring other \ncriminals contemplating possible attacks on our national security. \n \nAfter weighing the reliability of the source documentation and assessing the \nrelevancy and materiality of the facts proposed by the Government, pursuant to Rule 201, \nFederal Rules of Evidence, I take administrative notice of certain facts, as set forth below \nunder the PRC and Taiwan subsections. However, while I do not reject the facts set forth \nin the press releases, the inference that somehow Applicant and/or his family participated \nin criminal activity was not alleged or argued and is specifically rejected.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nIn his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted, with one brief comment, all of the \nfactual allegations pertaining to foreign influence (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a. through 1.c.). Applicant\u2019s \nadmissions and brief comment are incorporated herein as findings of fact. After a \ncomplete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, and upon due consideration \nof same, I make the following additional findings of fact:  \n \nBackground \n \nApplicant is a native-born U.S. citizen whose parents returned with him to Taiwan \nwhen he was an infant. He returned to the United States sometime between 2003 and \n2005. He is a 34-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has been serving as a \nsenior electrical engineer with his current employer since June 2017. He was a systems \nengineer with another defense contractor from July 2011 until December 2015. He \nreceived a bachelor\u2019s degree in 2011, and a master\u2019s degree in 2017, both from a \nrespected U.S. university. He has never served with the U.S. military or any other military. \nHe has never held a security clearance. He has never been married, and he has no \nchildren. (Item 3, at 5, 13-17; Item 4, at 3-4)  \n \nForeign Influence \n \n \nTo protect his privacy, general source information pertaining to Applicant and his \nfamily members discussed below can be found in the following exhibits: Item 3 (SF 86); \nand Item 4 (Enhanced Subject Interview). \n \nAs noted above, Applicant is a native-born U.S. citizen. At the age of 18, because \nhe was born in the United States to a citizen of Taiwan, he made the choice to renounce \nhis Taiwanese citizenship and he declared himself a U.S. citizen. (Item 3, at 5-7; Item 4, \nat 3) Applicant\u2019s parents divorced in approximately 2002, with his mother obtaining \n\n \n4 \n                                      \n \ncustody of him. His mother, in her 60s, is a native-born citizen of Taiwan, residing in \nTaiwan. Until she retired between July 2017 and April 2019, she was an employee in an \nunspecified position of a local private technical college in Taiwan. She never had any \naffiliation with either the Taiwanese or PRC governments, military, security, defense \nindustry, foreign movement, or intelligence services.  In July 2017, Applicant reported \nmonthly telephone or e-mail contact with his mother. (Item 3, at 23-25; Item 2, at 1)  \n \nApplicant\u2019s father, also in his 60s, is a native-born citizen of Taiwan, residing in \nTaiwan. Because his relationship with his father is more distant, Applicant does not know \nthe identity of his father\u2019s employer, and he has no knowledge of any affiliation with either \nthe Taiwanese or PRC governments, military, security, defense industry, foreign \nmovement, or intelligence services. In July 2017, Applicant reported annual contact with \nhis father. (Item 3, at 24-26)  \n \nApplicant\u2019s sister, in her 20s, is a native-born citizen of Taiwan, with a legal \nresidence in Taiwan, but currently residing in the United States where she is attending \nthe same university from which Applicant graduated. She never had any affiliation with \neither the Taiwanese or PRC governments, military, security, defense industry, foreign \nmovement, or intelligence services. In July 2017, Applicant reported weekly contacts with \nhis sister. (Item 3, at 26-27; Item 4, at 6-7)  \n \n \nApplicant previously received an inheritance, through his parents, from his \ngrandparents in Taiwan that he used to finance his education in the United States. (Item \n4, at 6) He has no foreign assets or foreign financial interests controlled by him or on his \nbehalf. (Item 3, at 66) \n \nTaiwan \n \nIn 1949, a large number of Chinese refugees fled from the civil war in mainland \nChina and immigrated to the off-shore Island of Formosa, now known as Taiwan. The \nCommunists in mainland China, under the leadership of Mao Tse-tung, established the \nPRC, and Chiang Kai-shek, the leader of the Kuomintang on mainland China, established \na provisional government and capital in Taipei, Taiwan. The PRC refuses to recognize \nTaiwan\u2019s independence, and insists that there is only \u201cone China.\u201d After recognizing \nTaiwan for nearly 30 years, on January 1, 1979, under the 1979 U.S. \u2013 PRC Joint \nCommunique, the United States formally switched its position and recognized the \ngovernment of the PRC as the sole legitimate government of China. Although the United \nStates does not support independence for Taiwan and, under the Taiwan Relations Act \n(TRA), signed into law on April 10, 1979, it is committed to a \u201cone-China policy,\u201d the U.S. \ncommitment to assist Taiwan in maintaining its defensive capability is enshrined in the \nTRA. Furthermore, because the United States and Taiwan enjoy a robust unofficial \nrelationship, the United States has been also been committed to maintaining cultural, \ncommercial and other nonofficial relations with Taiwan, and continues to provide arms in \nsupport of Taiwan\u2019s security and region stability. The American Institute in Taiwan (AIT) \nis responsible for implementing U.S. policy toward Taiwan. In this regard, the United \nStates insists on the peaceful resolution of cross-Strait differences, opposes unilateral \n\n \n5 \n                                      \n \nchanges to the status quo by either side, and encourages both sides to continue their \nconstructive dialogue on the basis of dignity and respect. \n \nTaiwan is a multi-party democracy with a strong economy, with significant \neconomic contacts with both the PRC and the United States. In fact, the PRC is Taiwan\u2019s \nlargest trading partner, export market, and source of imports. The United States stands \nin second place. Taiwan\u2019s own national security remains under constant threat from the \nPRC since the PRC has not renounced the use of force against Taiwan, and this has led \nto Taiwan\u2019s large military establishment. Taiwan\u2019s armed forces are equipped with \nweapons obtained primarily from the United States, but Taiwan has stressed military self-\nreliance in recent years which has resulted in the growth of indigenous military production. \n \nFollowing the election of Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen of the Democratic \nProgressive Party (DPP) in 2016, the PRC dramatically increased its coercion efforts \nagainst Taiwan. The major reason for those increased coercive efforts was the DPP\u2019s \nunwillingness to explicitly endorse the exact verbiage of the \u201cone China\u201d formulation while \nmaintaining the status quo. In retaliation, the PRC has taken significant steps to disrupt \nthe cross-Strait diplomatic truce; suspend or cancel official and semi-official \ncommunication and meetings; isolate and undermine the Taiwanese President; \ndestabilize the Taiwan society itself though \u201cUnited Front Work\u201d; interfere in relationships \nbetween Taiwan and other nations; interfere in Taiwan\u2019s efforts to participate in \ninternational activities; pressure U.S. and foreign companies doing business in Taiwan; \nand spreading disinformation through social media and other online tools.  \n \nTaiwan is believed to be an active collector of U.S. economic intelligence and \nproprietary information. There is no evidence that Taiwan uses coercive measures to gain \naccess to such information. While there have been a number of incidents involving \nindividuals, companies, and Taiwanese intelligence officers improperly acquiring U.S. \neconomic intelligence and proprietary information, there is no direct or indirect connection \nto, or involvement with, Applicant or his family members.  \n \nPRC \n \n The PRC is an international bully without regard for democracy or civil rights. It \nhas an authoritarian Communist government, with powerful military forces, including \nstrategic nuclear weapons and missiles. It is geographically vast and has a population of \nover a billion people. It has significant resources and an economy that in recent years has \nexpanded substantially. In the PRC, reported human rights problems include suppression \nof political dissent, arbitrary arrest and detention, forced confessions, disappearance, \ntorture and mistreatment of prisoners, and \u201carbitrary or unlawful deprivation of life.\u201d The \nPRC also monitors telephone conversations, facsimile transmissions, e-mail, text \nmessaging, and internet communications, and sometimes nonconsensual monitoring with \nlistening devices and surreptitious searching of hotel guestrooms.  \n \nThe PRC has been characterized as \u201cthe most aggressive country conducting \nespionage against the United States, focusing on obtaining U.S. information and \n\n \n6 \n                                      \n \ntechnologies beneficial to the [PRC\u2019s] military modernization and economic \ndevelopment.\u201d Those activities include economic espionage, theft of trade secrets, export \ncontrol violations, and technology transfer. It actively collects military, economic and \nproprietary, industrial information about the United States of the following types, including: \ninformation and communications technology; military technologies, particularly marine \nsystems and aerospace and aeronautics; civilian and dual-use technologies, especially \nclean technologies, advanced materials and manufacturing techniques, healthcare, \npharmaceuticals, and related technologies, and agricultural technology; and business \ninformation, especially energy and other natural resources and macroeconomic \ninformation. Americans of Chinese ancestry are considered prime intelligence targets by \nthe PRC. \u201cThe crux of the [PRC] approach is not to try to exploit a perceived vulnerability \nbut to appeal to an individual\u2019s desire to help [the PRC] out in some way . . . ethnic \ntargeting to arouse feelings of obligation is the single most distinctive feature of [the \nPRC\u2019s] intelligence operations.\u201d The PRC\u2019s pursuit of intellectual property, sensitive \nresearch and development plans, and U.S. Person data, remains a significant threat to \nthe U.S. government and private sector. U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement \nofficials have characterized PRC\u2019s espionage and industrial theft activities as the leading \nthreat to the security of U.S. technology. \n \nWhile there have been a number of criminal incidents involving individuals, \ncompanies, and PRC\u2019s intelligence officers improperly acquiring U.S. economic \nintelligence and proprietary information, there is no direct or indirect connection to, or \ninvolvement with, Applicant or his family.  \n \nPolicies \n \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the Executive \nBranch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security emphasizing, \n\u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d (Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. \n518, 528 (1988)) As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to control \naccess to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual \nis sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information. The President has \nauthorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant an applicant eligibility for \naccess to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to do so.\u201d (Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \nIndustry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified.)     \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the guidelines in SEAD 4. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the guidelines list potentially disqualifying \nconditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility \nfor access to classified information. \n \nAn administrative judge need not view the guidelines as inflexible, ironclad rules \nof law. Instead, acknowledging the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \n\n \n7 \n                                      \n \ndecision. The entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known \nas the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a meaningful decision. \n \nIn the decision-making process, facts must be established by \u201csubstantial \nevidence.\u201d \u201cSubstantial evidence [is] such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might \naccept as adequate to support a conclusion in light of all contrary evidence in the record.\u201d  \n(ISCR Case No. 04-11463 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2006) (citing Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1))  \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d  (See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994)) \n \nThe Government initially has the burden of producing evidence to establish a \npotentially disqualifying condition under the Directive, and has the burden of establishing \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Once the Government has produced substantial \nevidence of a disqualifying condition, under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant has the \nburden of persuasion to present evidence in refutation, explanation, extenuation or \nmitigation, sufficient to overcome the doubts raised by the Government\u2019s case. The \nburden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government. (See ISCR \nCase No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005)) \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours as well. It is \nbecause of this special relationship that the Government must be able to repose a high \ndegree of trust and confidence in those individuals to whom it grants access to classified \ninformation. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the \napplicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. Such \ndecisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather \nthan actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Furthermore, \u201csecurity clearance \ndeterminations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d (Egan, 484 U.S. at 531) \n \nClearance decisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense \nbe a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d (See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 \n7) Thus, nothing in this decision should be construed to suggest that I have based this \ndecision, in whole or in part, on any express or implied determination as to Applicant\u2019s \nallegiance, loyalty, or patriotism. It is merely an indication the Applicant has or has not \nmet the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for \nissuing a clearance.  In reaching this decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that \nare reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I \nhave avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \n \n \n\n \n8 \n                                      \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline B, Foreign Influence \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Foreign Influence is set out in AG \n\u00b6 6.  \n \nForeign contacts and interests, including, but not limited to, business, \nfinancial, and property interests, are a national security concern if they result \nin divided allegiance. They may also be a national security concern if they \ncreate circumstances in which the individual may be manipulated or induced \nto help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a way \ninconsistent with U.S. interests or otherwise made vulnerable to pressure \nor coercion by any foreign interest. Assessment of foreign contacts and \ninterests should consider the country in which the foreign contact or interest \nis located, including, but not limited to, considerations such as whether it is \nknown to target U.S. citizens to obtain classified or sensitive information or \nis associated with a risk of terrorism. \n \n \nThe guideline notes a condition that could raise security concerns under AG \u00b6 7: \n \n(a) contact, regardless of method, with a foreign family member, business \nor professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or \nresident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of \nforeign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion. \n \nApplicant\u2019s parents are citizen-residents of Taiwan. His sister is a citizen and legal \nresident of Taiwan, but an actual resident of the United States where she is studying for \nadvanced degrees at the same university from which Applicant graduated. Applicant \nknows for a fact that his mother and sister never had any affiliation with either the \nTaiwanese or PRC governments, military, security, defense industry, foreign movement, \nor intelligence services. Because of his parents\u2019 divorce, and the fact that his mother \nreceived custody of him in 2002, Applicant does not know the identity of his father\u2019s \nemployer, and he has no knowledge of any affiliation with either the Taiwanese or PRC \ngovernments, military, security, defense industry, foreign movement, or intelligence \nservices.  \n \nWhen foreign family ties are involved, the totality of an applicant\u2019s family ties to a \nforeign country as well as each individual family member must be analyzed. (ISCR Case \nNo. 01-22693 at 7 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2003)) If only one relative lives in a foreign country, \nand an applicant has contacts with that relative, this factor alone is sufficient to create the \npotential for foreign influence and could potentially result in the compromise of classified \ninformation. (See ISCR Case No. 03-02382 at 5 (App. Bd. Feb. 15, 2006); ISCR Case \nNo. 99-0424 at 12 (App. Bd. Feb. 8, 2001)) \n \n\n \n9 \n                                      \n \nThe mere possession of close family ties with a person in a foreign country is not, \nas a matter of law, disqualifying under Guideline B. Moreover, Guideline B is not limited \nto countries hostile to the United States. (ISCR Case No. 02-11570 at 5 (App. Bd. May \n19, 2004) (\u201cThe United States has a compelling interest in protecting and safeguarding \nclassified information from any person, organization, or country that is not authorized to \nhave access to it, regardless of whether that person, organization, or country has interests \ninimical to those of the United States.\u201d). Furthermore, \u201ceven friendly countries can have \nprofound disagreements with the United States over matters they view as important to \ntheir vital interests or national security.\u201d (ISCR Case No. 00-00317 at 6 (App. Bd. Mar. \n29, 2002))  \n \nFriendly nations have engaged in espionage against the United States, especially \nin the economic, scientific, and technical fields. Nevertheless, the nature of a nation\u2019s \ngovernment, its relationship with the United States, and its human rights record are \nrelevant in assessing the likelihood that an applicant\u2019s family members are vulnerable to \ngovernment coercion. The risk of coercion, persuasion, or duress is significantly greater \nif the foreign country has an authoritarian government, a family member is associated \nwith or dependent upon the government, or the country is known to conduct intelligence \noperations against the United States. It is reasonable to presume that a contentious \nrelationship, or the absence of a democratic government, is not determinative, but it may \nmake it more likely that a foreign government would attempt to exploit a U.S. citizen \nthrough relatives or associates in that foreign country. In considering the nature of the \ngovernment, an administrative judge must also consider any terrorist activity in the \ncountry at issue. (See ISCR Case No. 02-26130 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 7, 2006))  \n \nIn this instance, as noted above, there is substantial evidence to reflect that the \nPRC aggressively engages in economic espionage or military intelligence activity directed \ntoward the United States, and that it sponsors acts of attempted destabilization or actual \nterrorism toward Taiwan. The activities of PRC authorities are sufficient to establish a \npotential \u201cheightened risk\u201d \u2013 a risk that is greater than the normal risk inherent in having \na family member living under a foreign government. AG \u00b6 7(a) has been established as it \npertains to Applicant\u2019s parents, but not to Applicant\u2019s sister. \n \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns arising from foreign influence under AG \u00b6 8: \n \n(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in which \nthese persons are located, or the positions or activities of those persons in \nthat country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be placed in a \nposition of having to choose between the interests of a foreign individual, \ngroup, organization, or government and the interests of the United States; \nand \n \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual's sense of \nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, or allegiance to the group, \ngovernment, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such deep and \n\n \n10 \n                                      \n \nlongstanding relationships and loyalties in the United States, that the \nindividual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the \nU.S. interest. \n \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 8(a) and 8(b) apply. In reaching this conclusion, I have considered the \ntotality of Applicant\u2019s ties to Taiwan, as well as his family members still residing there. As \nnoted above, the United States and Taiwan have a lengthy history of friendly relations, \nmaking it less likely that the Taiwanese government would attempt coercive means to \nobtain sensitive information. However, it does not eliminate the possibility that a foreign \npower would employ some non-coercive measures in an attempt to exploit his relatives. \nWhile Applicant has two parents still actually residing in Taiwan, there may be speculation \nas to \u201csome risk,\u201d but that speculation, in the abstract, does not, without substantially \nmore, establish evidence of a \u201cheightened risk\u201d of foreign exploitation, inducement, \nmanipulation, pressure, or coercion, especially generated by the PRC. \n \nThe Government has submitted facts to reflect that the PRC and Taiwan engage \nin economic espionage and/or military intelligence activity directed toward the United \nStates. In addition, that the PRC is attempting to undermine the Taiwanese President and \ndestabilize the Taiwan society itself though \u201cUnited Front Work\u201d through sympathizers \noperating within the borders of Taiwan that might heighten the risk for Applicant\u2019s parents \nresiding in Taiwan, as well as his sister if she returns to Taiwan. In such a situation, \nTaiwan and all its citizens become potential victims of PRC \u201cterrorism,\u201d as much as the \nresidents of Hong Kong; the Uyghur Muslims of the Xinjiang region; and the people of \nTibet have become the victims of PRC\u2019s activities. The PRC destabilization effort is not \nunlike the situations created by other international entities in other countries that have \nseen acts of attempted destabilization or actual terrorism \u2013 France, United Kingdom, \nGermany, and Belgium \u2013 and yet, the \u201cheightened risk\u201d in those countries is considered \nreduced. In fact, just as U.S. law enforcement and the DOD strive to protect U.S. citizens \nfrom cyber-terrorists interfering in our national elections or physical terrorists, involving \nincidents such as those in Fort Hood, Texas; San Bernardino, California; New York City, \nNew York; and Dallas, Texas, no one has raised the banner of \u201cheightened risk\u201d over the \nUnited States to suggest that it is unsafe to have family members reside here.  \n \nWith relatively low-profile parents, both of whom are actual residents of Taiwan, \nand a sister who actually resides in the United States while she is attending her brother\u2019s \nuniversity to obtain her own degrees, there is a very low potential of forcing Applicant to \nchoose between the interests of the United States and those of Taiwan, the PRC, a \nterrorist organization, or those family members. While the PRC may be a destabilizing \nfactor to the world, not just to Taiwan, there is zero evidence of any relationship between \nApplicant\u2019s parents or his sister with the PRC that would raise a heightened risk.  \n \nWhile Applicant\u2019s ties to Taiwan, essentially only to his parents, remain, they are \noutweighed by his deep and long-standing relationships and loyalties in the United States. \nHe was born in the United States. His sister is here. While he attended primary schools \nin Taiwan, he earned two degrees from a university in the United States, and his life, \nhome, assets, and professional career are in the United States. His deep relationship with \n\n \n11 \n                                      \n \nthe United States is such that I find that it is unlikely that Applicant will be placed in a \nposition of having to choose between the interests of the United States and the interests \nof Taiwan. He can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the U.S. \ninterest.  \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6 2(d): \n  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nUnder SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. Moreover, I have \nevaluated the various aspects of this case in light of the totality of the record evidence \nand have not merely performed a piecemeal analysis. See U.S. v. Bottone, 365 F.2d 389, \n392 (2d Cir. 1966); see also ISCR Case No. 03-22861 at 2-3 (App. Bd. Jun. 2, 2006).  \n \nThere is some evidence against mitigating Applicant\u2019s situation. Taiwan is believed \nto be an active collector of U.S. economic intelligence and proprietary information. With \nparents who are Taiwanese citizen-residents, there is a potential risk that Taiwan would \nattempt to coerce Applicant through his parents still residing there. There is also the \nremote possibility that the PRC will reject the status quo and decide to invade Taiwan in \nan effort to actually annex it, placing all Taiwanese residents in jeopardy.  \n \nThe mitigating evidence under the whole-person concept is simply more \nsubstantial. Applicant is a 34-year-old native-born U.S. citizen whose parents returned \nwith him to Taiwan when he was an infant. At the age of 18, because he was born in the \nUnited States to a citizen of Taiwan, he made the choice to renounce his Taiwanese \ncitizenship and he declared himself a U.S. citizen. He returned to the United States \nsometime between 2003 and 2005. He is an employee of a defense contractor, and he \nhas been serving as a senior electrical engineer with his current employer since June \n2017. He was a systems engineer with another defense contractor from July 2011 until \nDecember 2015. He received a bachelor\u2019s degree in 2011, and a master\u2019s degree in 2017, \nboth from a respected U.S. university. His sister, a Taiwanese citizen, currently attends \nthe same university from which her brother graduated. \n \n\n \n12 \n                                      \n \nOverall, the evidence leaves me without any questions and doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all of these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant has mitigated the security concerns arising from his foreign influence. \nSee SEAD 4, App. A, AG \u00b6\u00b6 2(d)(1) through 2(d)(9). \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline B:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a. through 1.c.:  \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \n In light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security clearance.  \nEligibility for access to classified information is granted. \n \n \n                                        \n         \n \n \n \n________________________ \nROBERT ROBINSON GALES \nAdministrative Judge \n",

In August 2017, he was \nworking overseas as a systems engineer on a U.S. defense project on an allied nation\u2019s \nmilitary base. He was supposed to teach the foreign personnel how to use and \ntroubleshoot the system. He stated that the foreign personnel were lax about security, \nand he became desensitized to it.

He lied to them and denied that he used the foreign military member\u2019s \ncredentials to log into the system. Applicant also lied orally and in writing to supervisory \npersonnel from his employer. He later told the truth to an investigator from his employer. \n(Tr. at 64-85, 133-145; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 2-4; AE K) \n \nApplicant admitted that he was initially untruthful to the foreign military and to his \nsupervisors. He stated that he panicked when questioned by the military. He was alone \nin a room with four foreign military members, and he feared for his safety and freedom. \nHe stated that he did not tell his supervisors the truth because he did not trust them. He \nstated that once he was questioned by the investigator he was completely forthcoming. \n(Tr. at 64-85, 133-145, 158; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; AE K) \n \nApplicant submitted a Questionnaire for National Security Positions (SF 86) in \nSeptember 2017, while he was still employed by Company A. Under the employment \nsection, he wrote that he was \u201cwarned, reprimanded, suspended, or disciplined\u201d by \nCompany A in September 2017, with the following description: \u201cLogged in as another \nuser to finish a task that I was assigned.

He was hired by another defense contractor \n(Company B) in about November 2017. There was some difficulty in transferring his \n\n \n3 \n \nclearance from Company A to Company B, and he was asked to complete another SF \n86, which he submitted in December 2017. He was able to use the September 2017 SF \n86 as a template and add anything that had to be updated. (Tr. at 73, 85-88, 145-147; \nGE 1; AE A, B) \n \nApplicant reported his employment with Company A ended in November 2017. \nHe repeated the same information from the previous questionnaire that he was \u201cwarned, \nreprimanded, suspended, or disciplined\u201d by Company A in September 2017. He wrote \nthe reason for leaving the job as \u201cMy position was downsized.\u201d (GE 1) He answered \n\u201cNo\u201d to the following question: \n \nFor this employment have any of the following happened to you in the \nlast seven (7) years? \n \n\uf0b7 Fired \n\uf0b7 Quit after being told you would be fired \n\uf0b7 Left by mutual agreement following charges or allegations of \nmisconduct \n\uf0b7 Left by mutual agreement following notice of unsatisfactory \nperformance \n \nApplicant was notified by Company B\u2019s facility security officer (FSO) on February \n22, 2018, that his investigation was completed, and that based on an investigation \ndated May 2, 2013, he was \u201cgranted Secret eligibility\u201d on January 24, 2018. (AE H) \n \nApplicant requested a copy of his DOD Consolidated Adjudications Facility (CAF) \nadjudicative records on April 30, 2018. The DOD CAF replied on May 16, 2018, with a \ncopy of the September 2017 SF 86. (AE G) \n \nApplicant was interviewed for his background investigation in July 2018. A signed \nstatement was not obtained, but the interview was summarized in a report of \ninvestigation (ROI). He voluntarily informed the investigator that he was terminated from \nCompany A in October 2017. He told the investigator that he did not know why his \nquestionnaire reported his position was downsized, as he completed the questionnaire \nin September 2017 while he was working for Company A. (Tr. at 90-91; GE 2; AE I) \n \nApplicant was provided a copy of the ROI in DOHA interrogatories and asked \nabout its accuracy. He wrote the following in a response, dated May 2, 2019: \u201cI listed my \nposition as downsized because my manager, [redacted], told me they were doing away \nwith the position before I was terminated.\u201d (GE 2) \n \nApplicant\u2019s response to the SOR was prepared by his attorney, but adopted by \nApplicant as the truth and notarized on June 21, 2019 (48 days after his response to \nDOHA interrogatories). The response stated: \n \nRegarding the CAF\u2019s allegation that [Applicant] submitted this SF 86 in \nDecember, and that he reported that he had been \u201cdownsized,\u201d he has not \n\n \n4 \n \nbeen provided with any evidence that that is the case. He has no memory \nof that, has no reason to have lied when he had already been forthcoming \nabout the same incident and later was forthcoming in an interview. \n \nApplicant denied intentionally providing false information on the SF about his \ntermination from Employer A. He stated that he submitted the September 2017 SF 86, \nbut he did not remember submitting a second SF 86. He stated that he had no reason to \nlie because he reported the underlying conduct to the DOD. He asserted, without \ncorroborating documentation, that Company B was aware that he had been terminated \nfrom Company A because he put it on his job application. He stated that he did not \nremember writing on the SF 86 that his position with Company A was \u201cdownsized,\u201d but if \nhe did write it, it was because when he left the foreign country he was told by his \nsupervisor that his position was being downsized and would be backfilled by a foreign \nnational. (Tr. at 85-89, 108-111, 149-156; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 2) \n \nApplicant volunteers in his community. He submitted documents and letters \nattesting to his excellent job performance in the military and as a civilian. He is praised \nfor his moral character, honesty, patriotism, professionalism, trustworthiness, \nresponsibility, work ethic, reliability, judgment, integrity, and willingness and ability to \nprotect classified information. He is recommended for a security clearance. (AE B-F) \n \nPolicies \n \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG), which became \neffective on June 8, 2017. \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d  \n\n \n5 \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.  \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct  \n \n  \nThe security concern for personal conduct is set out in AG \u00b6 15, as follows: \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process. \n \n  \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. The following disqualifying conditions are potentially applicable: \n \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or \nsimilar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment \nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance \neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities;  \n \n(b) deliberately providing false or misleading information; or concealing or \nomitting information, concerning relevant facts to an employer, \ninvestigator, security official, competent medical or mental health \nprofessional involved in making a recommendation relevant to a national \n\n \n6 \n \nsecurity \neligibility \ndetermination, \nor \nother \nofficial \ngovernment \nrepresentative; \n \n(c) credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is \nnot sufficient for an adverse determination under any other single \nguideline, but which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-\nperson \nassessment \nof \nquestionable \njudgment, \nuntrustworthiness, \nunreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and \nregulations, or other characteristics indicating that the individual may not \nproperly safeguard classified or sensitive information; and \n \n(e) personal conduct, or concealment of information about one\u2019s conduct, \nthat creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress by a \nforeign intelligence entity or other individual or group. Such conduct \nincludes: \n \n(1) engaging in activities which, if known, could affect the person\u2019s \npersonal, professional, or community standing. \n \nApplicant worked overseas as a systems engineer on a U.S. defense project on \nan allied nation\u2019s military base. He violated security rules by logging into the system \nusing the credentials of a member of the foreign country\u2019s military. That conduct reflects \nquestionable judgment and an unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations. It \nalso created vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, and duress. AG \u00b6\u00b6 16(c) and \n16(e) are applicable.  \n \nApplicant was questioned about the incident by members of the foreign country\u2019s \nmilitary. He lied to them and denied that he used the foreign military member\u2019s \ncredentials to log into the system. He also lied to supervisory personnel from his \nemployer. AG \u00b6 16(b) is applicable.  \n \n \nApplicant submitted SF 86s in September 2017 (while he was still employed by \nCompany A) and December 2017 (after he was terminated by Company A). He did not \nreport on the December 2017 SF 86 that he was terminated by Company A. Instead, he \nwrote that his \u201cposition was downsized.\u201d He denied intentionally providing false \ninformation on the December 2017 SF 86. He stated that he had no reason to lie \nbecause he reported the underlying conduct to the DOD. He asserted that he did not \nremember completing the second SF 86, but if he did write that his position with \nCompany A was \u201cdownsized,\u201d it was because when he left the foreign country he was \ntold by his supervisor that his position was being downsized and would be backfilled by \na foreign national. \n \nI did not find Applicant credible, and I did not find his explanations to be worthy of \nbelief. After considering all the evidence, including Applicant\u2019s testimony, age, \neducation, experience, motive to fabricate, prior false statements, and strong character \n\n \n7 \n \nevidence, I find by substantial evidence1 that he intentionally provided false information \nabout his termination from Company A on the December 2017 SF 86. AG \u00b6 16(a) is \napplicable. \nAG \u00b6 17 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. The following \nare potentially applicable:  \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; \n(b) the refusal or failure to cooperate, omission, or concealment was \ncaused or significantly contributed to by advice of legal counsel or of a \nperson with professional responsibilities for advising or instructing the \nindividual specifically concerning security processes. Upon being made \naware of the requirement to cooperate or provide the information, the \nindividual cooperated fully and truthfully; \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, \nunreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely \nto recur; and \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate \nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress. \n \nApplicant admitted lying to the foreign military members and his employer\u2019s \nsupervisors. He stated that he was intimidated by the foreign service members, and he \ndid not trust his supervisors. He eventually told the truth to an investigator from his \ncompany. He was interviewed for his background investigation in July 2018. He \nvoluntarily informed the investigator that he was terminated from Company A in October \n2017. \n \n \nHad Applicant been honest from the beginning about the circumstances \nsurrounding his termination from Company A, that conduct would likely have been \n                                                          \n1 Substantial evidence is \u201csuch relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to \nsupport a conclusion in light of all the contrary evidence in the same record.\u201d See, e.g., ISCR Case No. \n17-04166 at 3 (App. Bd. Mar. 21, 2019) (citing Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1). \u201cThis is something less than the \nweight of the evidence, and the possibility of drawing two inconsistent conclusions from the evidence \ndoes not prevent [a Judge\u2019s] finding from being supported by substantial evidence.\u201d Consolo v. Federal \nMaritime Comm\u2019n, 383 U.S. 607, 620 (1966). \u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than \na preponderance.\u201d See v. Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994); ISCR \nCase No. 04-07187 at 5 (App. Bd. Nov. 17, 2006). \n\n \n8 \n \nmitigated. However, Applicant has consistently denied that he lied on the December \n2017 SF 86. Having determined that he intentionally omitted information from that SF \n86, I have also determined that his explanations that the omissions were unintentional \nwere also false. It would be inconsistent to find his conduct mitigated.2 Without complete \ncandor, there are no applicable mitigating conditions and none of the conduct is \nmitigated.  \n \nGuideline M, Use of Information Technology  \n \nThe security concern for use of information technology is set out in AG \u00b6 39: \n \nFailure to comply with rules, procedures, guidelines, or regulations \npertaining to information technology systems may raise security concerns \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, calling into question \nthe willingness or ability to properly protect sensitive systems, networks, \nand information. Information Technology includes any computer-based, \nmobile, or wireless device used to create, store, access, process, \nmanipulate, protect, or move information. This includes any component, \nwhether integrated into a larger system or not, such as hardware, \nsoftware, or firmware, used to enable or facilitate these operations. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 40 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. The following are potentially applicable:  \n \n \n(a) unauthorized entry into any information technology system; \n \n(c) use of any information technology system to gain unauthorized access \nto another system or to a compartmented area within the same system; \nand \n \n(e) unauthorized use of any information technology system. \n                                                          \n2 See ISCR Case 03-22819 at 4 (App. Bd. Mar. 20, 2006), in which the Appeal Board reversed the \nAdministrative Judge\u2019s decision to grant Applicant\u2019s security clearance: \n \nOnce the Administrative Judge found that Applicant deliberately falsified a security \nclearance application in September 2002, the Judge could not render a favorable security \nclearance decision without articulating a rational basis for why it would be clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant \ndespite the falsification. Here, the Judge gives reasons as to why he considers the \nfalsification mitigated under a \u201cwhole person\u201d analysis, namely that Applicant has \nmatured, has held a position of responsibility, recognizes how important it is to be candid \nin relation to matters relating to her security clearance, and has changed her behavior so \nthat there is little likelihood of recurrence. However, the Judge\u2019s conclusion runs contrary \nto the Judge\u2019s rejection of Applicant\u2019s explanations for the security clearance application \nfalsification. At the hearing (after earlier admitting the falsification in her March 2003 \nwritten statement to a security investigator), Applicant testified that she had not \nintentionally falsified her application. Given the Judge\u2019s rejection of this explanation as \nnot being credible, it follows that the Judge could not have concluded Applicant now \nrecognizes the importance of candor and has changed her behavior. \n\n \n9 \n \n \nApplicant violated security rules by logging into a system using the credentials of \na member of the foreign country\u2019s military. The above disqualifying conditions are \napplicable.  \n \nConditions that could mitigate the use of information technology systems security \nconcerns are provided under AG \u00b6 41. The following is potentially applicable: \n \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur \nand does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or \ngood judgment; and \n \n(b) the misuse was minor and done solely in the interest of organizational \nefficiency and effectiveness. \n \n \nThe above analysis under personal conduct also applies here. Applicant\u2019s \nconduct continues to cast doubt on his reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 41(a) and 41(b) are not applicable.  \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guidelines E and M in my whole-person analysis. I also considered \nApplicant\u2019s honorable military service, his work overseas, and his strong character \nevidence, but the favorable information is insufficient to overcome his incidents involving \nquestionable judgment and dishonesty.  \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude Applicant did not \nmitigate the personal conduct and use of information technology security concerns.  \n \n\n \n10 \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline M:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 2.a-2.c: \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIt is not clearly consistent with the national interest to continue Applicant\u2019s \neligibility for a security clearance.

Cervi, Administrative Judge: \n \nThis case involves national security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial \nConsiderations) and Guideline E (Personal Conduct). The personal conduct concern was \nunfounded, but Applicant failed to mitigate the financial considerations security concerns. \nEligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nApplicant submitted a security clearance application (SCA) on June 12, 2018, \nseeking eligibility for a Department of Defense (DOD) security clearance. On May 3, 2019, \nthe DOD issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing security concerns \nunder Guidelines F (Financial Considerations) and E (Personal Conduct). Applicant \nanswered the SOR on May 20, 2019, and requested a hearing before an administrative \njudge. The DOD CAF acted under Executive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; and DOD \nDirective 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program \n(January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive). The Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) were \nrevised effective June 8, 2017, and apply herein.  \n \n\n \n2 \n \nThe case was assigned to me on July 8, 2019. The Defense Office of Hearings \nand Appeals (DOHA) issued a notice of hearing on August 19, 2019, scheduling the \nhearing for September 9, 2019. The hearing was convened as scheduled. Government \nExhibits (GE) 1 through 7 were admitted in evidence without objection. Applicant and a \ncharacter witness testified on her behalf. The record was held open for Applicant to submit \nadditional information. She submitted Applicant Exhibit (AE) A, which was admitted \nwithout objection. DOHA received the hearing transcript (Tr.) on September 18, 2019. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant is a 59-year-old building security officer for a defense contractor, most \nrecently employed since April 2018. She listed a five-month period of unemployment in \n2015, and noted an inconsistent employment history from 1996 to 2001. She graduated \nhigh school in 1979, and is currently taking classes toward an associate\u2019s degree. She \nmarried in 1990, and has no children. She does not currently hold a security clearance. \n \n \nThe SOR alleges under Guideline F, a Chapter 7 bankruptcy filed in 2000 and \ndischarged in 2001; a Chapter 13 Bankruptcy filed in 2007 and discharged in 2014; a \nChapter 13 bankruptcy filed in 2016, converted to a Chapter 7 bankruptcy, and \ndischarged in August 2016; and a vehicle loan collection account totaling $22,000. In \naddition, the SOR alleges under Guideline E, that Applicant falsified her 2018 SCA by \nfailing to disclose the collection account listed in the SOR. Applicant admitted all of the \nbankruptcy allegations, and denied the auto loan collection and falsification allegations. \n \n \nApplicant and her spouse have inconsistent work histories, partially due to her \nspouse\u2019s disabilities, and Applicant expended time and money to assist her elderly \nmother. Applicant\u2019s spouse was injured while serving on active duty and in a civilian job, \nand receives disability benefits from the Department of Veterans Affairs and Social \nSecurity. He testified that he worked 27 jobs in 25 years because of a back injury and \npost-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). They jointly filed Chapter 7 bankruptcy petitions \nin 1997 and 1998. Both were dismissed.  \n \n \nIn 2000, Applicant\u2019s spouse was injured on the job and unable to work. Since they \nwere both working in temporary jobs at the time, they were unable to generate sufficient \nhousehold income to meet their expenses. They filed a joint Chapter 7 bankruptcy petition \nin 2000 that was discharged in 2001. Applicant stated that they were able to discharge \nabout $20,000 in consumer debt. In 2001 they started a business supplying gift shops. \nThe business closed in 2006. \n \n \nIn 2007, Applicant and her spouse filed a joint Chapter 13 bankruptcy petition. \nApplicant paid $4,348 to creditors under the plan, and $141,866 of unsecured claims were \ndischarged without payment. The bankruptcy was discharged in 2014. The bankruptcy \nfiling was preceded by Applicant\u2019s spouse receiving an $81,000 settlement for a \nworkplace injury in 2006. Applicant also had a home foreclosed in 2006 because they \nwere unable to refinance. The mortgage deficiency balance was forgiven after the 2007 \nbankruptcy was filed. \n \n\n \n3 \n \n \nTwo years after the last bankruptcy discharge, Applicant and her spouse again \nfiled a joint Chapter 13 bankruptcy petition in March 2016. They converted the petition to \na Chapter 7 bankruptcy in May 2016. Applicant abandoned $80,410 in assets and \ndischarged $241,832 in debts. The bankruptcy was discharged in August 2016. Applicant \nclaims the majority of debts were joint accounts initiated by her spouse, who purchased \nthree vehicles for a ride-share business, but the business quickly failed. He also had about \n$100,000 in student loans that were forgiven due to his disability. \n \n \nApplicant took out an auto loan that became delinquent in 2016 for $38,183, and \nplaced in collection. She stated that she began paying the agreed $530 per month in \nOctober 2016, but fell behind by making partial, irregular payments beginning in April \n2017. In May 2019, she made a $7,221 payment to bring the account current, and \nresumed the $530 monthly payments from June to September 2019. She stated that she \nwas laid off from work when she was unable to make all required payments, however, the \npartial, irregular payments lasted from July 2017 until May 2019. As of September 2019, \nApplicant owed a balance of $19,091 on the account. Of note, Applicant reported that she \nworked two full-time jobs at that time; from September 2015 to January 2018 as a cashier \nfor a government contractor, and a second job from September 2015 to September 2016 \nas a receiving clerk for a retail store. \n \n \nApplicant provided a basic budget purporting to show that she and her spouse live \nwithin their means using her spouse\u2019s disability income alone. Applicant testified that she \ncurrently earns about $48,000 per year, and her spouse receives about $50,000 per year \nin disability income. Applicant has about $1,000 in savings, and is paying on a $28,000 \nstudent loan. She also has joint certificates of deposit valued at about $28,346.  \n \n \nIn July 2019, Applicant and her spouse took a vacation and entered into a \ntimeshare agreement. Despite a plan to vacation in Hawaii and Israel, they later \ndiscovered that the timeshare agreement had a negative effect on their credit and \nunexpected charges were placed on their credit card. They drafted a letter to the \ntimeshare company asking to be relieved of the obligation because they may not be able \nto purchase a home with poor credit scores. The letter is an undated and unsigned copy, \nso I do not know when or if it was delivered and the current status of account. I note the \ntimeshare does not appear as a line item on Applicant\u2019s budget. Applicant utilized court-\nmandated credit counseling before each bankruptcy filing. \n \n \nWhen Applicant completed her SCA in June 2018, she was making partial \npayments on the auto loan collection account, however, she did not disclose the \ndelinquency or collection account as required. Applicant explained that since she was in \na repayment plan with the collection agent, and making payments, albeit partial and \nirregular, that she did not consider the account to be delinquent. She stated that she did \nnot intentionally fail to list the debt, but misunderstood the status of the debt when she \ncompleted the SCA. Applicant disclosed her 2016 Chapter 7 bankruptcy in her SCA. \n \n \n \n \n\n \n4 \n \nLaw and Policies \n \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 2. \n \nNational security eligibility is predicated upon the applicant meeting the criteria \ncontained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. \nInstead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge applies \nthese guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative \njudge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider a person\u2019s stability, trustworthiness, reliability, \ndiscretion, character, honesty, and judgment. AG \u00b6 1(b). \n \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865  \n\u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \n \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \u201cSubstantial \nevidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. Washington \nMetro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines presume a \nnexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria listed \ntherein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 12-01295 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Jan. 20, 2015). \n \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition,  \nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. \n02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \n\n \n5 \n \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01- \n20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see, AG \u00b6 1(d). \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18:       \n \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds.  \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case:   \n \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \n \n \nApplicant incurred multiple delinquent debts over a significant period resulting in \ntwo bankruptcy filings that were dismissed in 1997 and 1998, and three discharged \nbankruptcies in 2001, 2014, and 2016. In addition, Applicant has been making irregular \nand inconsistent payments on a significant collection account since 2016. The evidence \nis sufficient to raise the above disqualifying conditions. \n \n  \nConditions that could mitigate the financial considerations security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 20. The following are potentially applicable:  \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n\n \n6 \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; and \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \n \n \nApplicant attributed her financial problems to her and her spouse\u2019s inconsistent \nemployment history, her spouse\u2019s disabilities, failed business endeavors, and caring for \nher elderly mother. I note that Applicant and her spouse have no children, and they both \nhave a history of working, although they changed jobs regularly, a factor largely outside \nof their control. Applicant defaulted on her 2016 car loan the same year it was incurred, \nand despite working two jobs and agreeing to a repayment plan offered by the collection \nagent, she has been unable to consistently make the required payments until recently \nwhen she brought the payments up to date. The record is replete with Applicant\u2019s \ncontinued use of the bankruptcy courts to reduce or extinguish her debts. Although use \nof the bankruptcy process is a recognized method of debt resolution, it must be followed \nwith a reasonable track record of responsible financial decisions. That track record is \nabsent in this case.  \n \n \nI am unable to find that Applicant acted responsibly under the circumstances or \nthat she made good-faith efforts to resolve delinquent debts or negotiate good-faith \nsolutions to her financial problems when they arose. AG \u00b6 20(b) and (c) are partially \napplicable, but they are not conclusive. Although Applicant\u2019s financial situation may \nmoderate now that her spouse has a substantial disability income, I am not convinced, \nbased on her track record so far, that future delinquencies will not recur and that Applicant \nhas the intent, means, and ability to resolve debts when they do occur. None of the other \nmitigating conditions fully apply to show that Applicant has a handle on her financial status \nand can responsibly resolve debts in the future. Applicant\u2019s financial history continues to \ncast doubt on her current reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. \n \nGuideline E: Personal Conduct  \n \n  \nThe security concern for personal conduct is set out in AG \u00b6 15, as follows: \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. \n \n  \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. The following disqualifying condition is potentially applicable: \n \n\n \n7 \n \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar \nform used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, \naward benefits or status, determine national security eligibility or \ntrustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities. \n \n \nWhen falsification allegations are controverted, as in this case, the Government \nhas the burden of proving the allegations. An omission, standing alone, does not prove \nfalsification. An administrative judge must consider the record evidence as a whole to \ndetermine an applicant\u2019s state of mind at the time of the omission. See ISCR Case No. \n03-09483 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 17, 2004). An applicant\u2019s level of education and business \nexperience are relevant to determining whether a failure to disclose relevant information \non a security clearance application was deliberate. ISCR Case No. 08-05637 (App. Bd. \nSep. 9, 2010). \n \n  \nApplicant did not report her collection account on her SCA, but she did disclose \nher 2016 Chapter 7 bankruptcy. Applicant denied intentionally falsifying her SCA, and \nattributed the omission to a misunderstanding of the status of the collection account, since \nshe was making somewhat regular, albeit reduced payments under a repayment plan. I \nfind that based on Applicant\u2019s answer and testimony, her failure to report the delinquency \nand collection status on her SCA was not intentional. She provided a plausible \nexplanation for her omissions, and intentional falsification is not supported by the \nevidence. AG \u00b6 16(a) is not applicable to SOR \u00b6 2.a. The personal conduct security \nconcern is concluded for Applicant. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a). Under AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate \ndetermination of whether to grant eligibility for a security clearance must be an overall \ncommonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the guidelines and the \nwhole-person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuidelines F and E in my whole-person analysis.  \n \nI considered Applicant\u2019s answer, her testimony, testimony of her witness, and the \ndocumentary evidence. Applicant faced financial hardships, however she has not shown \nfinancial responsibility with regard to the accumulation or resolution of debts. Her history \nof bankruptcies raises concerns for her financial track record, and based on the record \npresented, there is insufficient evidence to show that she has the resources or ability to \nresolve future debts without resorting to extraordinary means when repayment is no \nlonger feasible. I am not convinced that she knowingly failed to submit truthful answers \non her SCA. \n\n \n8 \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude Applicant has not \nmitigated the financial considerations. The personal conduct security concerns were not \nestablished.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n  Subparagraphs 1.a-1.d:  \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \n \n \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n  Subparagraph 2.a:  \n \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n \n________________________ \nGregg A. Cervi \nAdministrative Judge \n",

Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.  \nStatement of the Case \n \nOn May 20, 2019, the Department of Defense (DOD) issued a Statement of \nReasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing security concerns under Guidelines B (foreign \ninfluence) and F (financial considerations). Applicant responded to the SOR on June 3, \n2019, and requested a decision on the written record in lieu of a hearing.  \n \nThe Government\u2019s written case was submitted on an indeterminate date. A \ncomplete copy of the file of relevant material (FORM) was provided to Applicant, who \nwas afforded an opportunity to file objections and submit material to refute, extenuate, \nor mitigate the security concerns. Applicant received the FORM on August 29, 2019. As \nof October 15, 2019, he had not responded. The case was assigned to me on \nNovember 21, 2019.  \n\n \n2 \n \n \nThe Government exhibits included in the FORM are admitted in evidence. \nDepartment Counsel requested that I take administrative notice of certain facts about \nIraq. Without objection, I have taken administrative notice of the facts contained in the \nrequest. The facts are summarized in the written request and will not be repeated \nverbatim in this decision. Of particular note is the significant threat of terrorism and \nongoing human rights problems in Iraq. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant is a 54-year-old prospective employee of a defense contractor. He \napparently will be hired as a linguist if he obtains a security clearance. He married in \n2003 and divorced in 2018. He has four minor children. (Items 4-6, 12, 13) \n \nApplicant was born in Iraq to Iraqi parents. He performed mandatory service in \nthe Iraqi military from 1985 to 1990. He came to the United States in 2000 or 2001, and \nwas granted asylum. He became a U.S. citizen in 2014. (Items 4-6, 12, 13) \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s children were all born in the United States. His parents are deceased. \nHe had seven siblings, but one sibling is deceased. One of his siblings is a U.S. citizen \nand resident. Another sibling lives in the United States. Four of his siblings are citizens \nand residents of Iraq. His male siblings performed mandatory military service, but it \ndoes not appear that any of his siblings have a current direct connection to the Iraqi \ngovernment. (Items 4-6, 12, 13) \n \n \nApplicant worked as a linguist for defense contractors in Iraq from about 2006 to \n2009. He indicated that he was terminated from the job after he had a fight with his \nfriend, a Pakistani linguist, over religion. His friend was also terminated. (Items 5, 6, 13) \n \n \nApplicant was unable to secure stable employment after he returned from Iraq. \nHe also indicated that his ex-wife overspent and had costly elective surgery. He was \nunable to pay all his bills, and a number of debts became delinquent. The SOR alleges \nnine delinquent debts totaling about $15,000 and three unpaid judgments totaling about \n$26,900. Applicant admitted owing all the debts and judgments. The debts and \njudgments are also corroborated through credit reports and court records. (Items 3, 5-\n11, 13)  \n \n \nApplicant stated that the $3,543 judgment was for unpaid rent. He indicated that \nhis state income tax refunds were garnished to pay the judgment. Court records indicate \nthat garnishment orders were in effect for all three judgments, but the records are \nunclear as to how much was garnished. (Items 6-11, 13) \n \n \nApplicant did not submit any additional documentation about the judgments and \nthe delinquent debts. He has not paid any of the delinquent debts, even though six of \nthe debts are between $104 and $300. He did not state how, when, or if he plans to pay \nhis debts. There is no evidence of financial counseling.  \n \n\n \n3 \n \n \nPolicies \n \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG), which became \neffective on June 8, 2017. \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.  \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \n\n \n4 \n \n \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18:       \n \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds.  \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case:   \n \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \n \nApplicant has a history of financial problems, including delinquent debts and \nunpaid judgments. The evidence is sufficient to raise the above disqualifying conditions. \n \n  \nConditions that could mitigate the financial considerations security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 20. The following are potentially applicable:  \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment;  \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \n\n \n5 \n \n \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control; and \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.  \n \n \nApplicant attributed his financial problems to his inability to secure stable \nemployment after he returned from Iraq. He also indicated that his ex-wife overspent \nand had costly elective surgery. His ex-wife\u2019s actions may have been beyond his \ncontrol, but his employment issues resulted after he was terminated because he had a \nfight with a Pakistani linguist over religion. \n \n \nApplicant has done virtually nothing to voluntarily pay any of his debts, even \nthough six of the debts are between $104 and $300. He did not state how, when, or if \nhe plans to pay his debts. There is no evidence of financial counseling. \n \nThere is insufficient evidence for a determination that Applicant\u2019s financial \nproblems will be resolved within a reasonable period. I am unable to find that he acted \nresponsibly under the circumstances or that he made a good-faith effort to pay his \ndebts. His financial issues are recent and ongoing. They continue to cast doubt on his \ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. None of the above mitigating \nconditions are sufficiently applicable to dispel security concerns about Applicant\u2019s \nfinances. \n \nGuideline B, Foreign Influence \n \n \nThe security concern for foreign influence is set out in AG \u00b6 6: \n \nForeign contacts and interests, including, but not limited to, business, \nfinancial, and property interests, are a national security concern if they \nresult in divided allegiance. They may also be a national security concern \nif they create circumstances in which the individual may be manipulated or \ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a \nway inconsistent with U.S. interests or otherwise made vulnerable to \npressure or coercion by any foreign interest. Assessment of foreign \ncontacts and interests should consider the country in which the foreign \ncontact or interest is located, including, but not limited to, considerations \nsuch as whether it is known to target U.S. citizens to obtain classified or \nsensitive information or is associated with a risk of terrorism. \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 7. The following are potentially applicable in this case:   \n \n(a) contact, regardless of method, with a foreign family member, business \nor professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or \n\n \n6 \n \n \nresident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of \nforeign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; and \n \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual's obligation to \nprotect classified or sensitive information or technology and the \nindividual\u2019s desire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing \nthat information or technology. \n \nApplicant\u2019s four siblings are citizens and residents of Iraq. The potential for \nterrorist violence against U.S. interests and citizens remains high in Iraq, and it \ncontinues to have human rights problems. Applicant\u2019s foreign contacts create a potential \nconflict of interest and a heightened risk of foreign exploitation, inducement, \nmanipulation, pressure, and coercion. The above disqualifying conditions have been \nraised by the evidence.  \n \nConditions that could mitigate foreign influence security concerns are provided \nunder AG \u00b6 8. The following are potentially applicable:  \n \n(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in \nwhich these persons are located, or the positions or activities of those \npersons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be \nplaced in a position of having to choose between the interests of a foreign \nindividual, group, organization, or government and the interests of the \nUnited States; \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of \nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, or allegiance to the group, \ngovernment, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such deep and \nlongstanding relationships and loyalties in the United States, that the \nindividual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the \nU.S. interest; and \n(c) contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and \ninfrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign \ninfluence or exploitation. \n \nI considered the totality of Applicant\u2019s ties to Iraq. The nature of a nation\u2019s \ngovernment, its relationship with the United States, and its human rights record are \nrelevant in assessing the likelihood that an applicant\u2019s family members are vulnerable to \ngovernment coercion. The risk of coercion, persuasion, or duress is significantly greater \nif the foreign country has an authoritarian government, a family member is associated \nwith or dependent upon the government, the country is known to conduct intelligence \noperations against the United States, or the foreign country is associated with a risk of \nterrorism.  \n \n\n \n7 \n \n \nApplicant has some relationships and loyalties in the United States. He has lived \nin the United States since 2000 or 2001, and he became a U.S. citizen in 2014. His \nchildren were all born in the United States, and two of his siblings live in the United \nStates. He worked as a linguist for defense contractors in Iraq from about 2006 to 2009.  \n \nApplicant also has four siblings who are citizens and residents of Iraq. Having \ndetermined that his Iraqi siblings raised security concerns, the burden is squarely on \nApplicant to mitigate those security concerns. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 19-01151 at 5-\n6 (App. Bd. Dec. 10, 2019). There is a strong presumption against the grant or \nmaintenance of a security clearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th \nCir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991). The limited information in the FORM has \nnot convinced me that Applicant has met his burden. Security concerns raised by \nApplicant\u2019s family members in Iraq are not mitigated. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the \npotentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and \ncircumstances surrounding this case.

Applicant, age 40, is married with three minor children. She has been employed as an engineer by the same defense contractor since earning her bachelor\u2019s degree in 2001. She has held a DOD security clearance since 2002. The SOR alleged 12 delinquent accounts that were either charged off or placed for collection (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a \u2013 1.l). The debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.l is a duplicate of that alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.e. The remaining 11 debts totaled $39,646.

Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nApplicant submitted a security clearance application (SCA) on May 26, 2017. On \nApril 26, 2019, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications Facility (DOD \nCAF) sent her a Statement of Reasons (SOR) alleging security concerns under \nGuideline F. The DOD CAF acted under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) implemented by \nthe DOD on June 8, 2017. \n \nApplicant answered the SOR on May 22, 2019, and requested a decision on the \nrecord without a hearing. On June 18, 2019, the Government sent Applicant a complete \ncopy of its written case, a file of relevant material (FORM) including documents \nidentified as Items 1 through 6. She was given an opportunity to submit a documentary \nresponse setting forth objections, rebuttal, extenuation, mitigation, or explanation to the \nGovernment\u2019s evidence. She received the FORM on July 30, 2019, and timely \nsubmitted her response on August 7, 2019 (FORM Response 1), to which the \n\n \n2 \n \nGovernment did not object. Items 1 and 2 are the pleadings in the case. Items 3, 5, and \n6 were admitted into evidence. Item 4 was admitted into evidence for the limited \npurpose described in the procedural matter section below. Applicant\u2019s SOR answer \nincluded documents that were evidentiary in nature, which were admitted into evidence \nas Applicant Exhibits (AE) A through E. FORM Response 1 included a copy of the SOR, \nwhich is already part of the record, and several documents that were admitted as AE F \nthrough J. The case was assigned to me on August 29, 2019. Applicant submitted an \nadditional FORM response on September 5, 2019 (FORM Response 2), to which the \nGovernment did not object. I admitted the documents attached to FORM Response 2 \ncollectively as AE K.  \n \nProcedural Matter \n \n \nThe Government included a summary of Applicant\u2019s security clearance interview \n(Item 4) among the evidentiary items in the FORM. The Government included in the \nFORM a prominent notice advising Applicant of her right to object to the admissibility of \nItem 4 on the ground that it was not authenticated as required by Directive \u00b6 E3.1.20. \nThe Government did not, however, advise Applicant of the consequences of her failure \nto raise an objection to Item 4 in her responses to the FORM: specifically, that she could \nbe considered to have waived any such objection; and that Item 4 could be considered \nas evidence in her case. Applicant did not raise an objection to Item 4 in either FORM \nresponse. However, because she was not advised that Item 4 could be considered as \nevidence absent her objection, Item 4 is admitted only for the limited purpose of \nconsidering any mitigating or exculpatory information therein. I will not consider any \ndisqualifying or derogatory information contained in Item 4 that is not corroborated by \nadmissible evidence. \n \nFindings of Fact \nUnless otherwise indicated by citation to another part of the record, I have \nextracted these findings of fact from Applicant\u2019s SOR Answer (Item 2), and her SCA \n(Item 3). Applicant, age 40, is married with three minor children. She has been \nemployed as an engineer by the same defense contractor since earning her bachelor\u2019s \ndegree in 2001. She has held a DOD security clearance since 2002.  \n \nThe SOR alleged 12 delinquent accounts that were either charged off or placed \nfor collection (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a \u2013 1.l). The debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.l is a duplicate of that \nalleged in SOR \u00b6 1.e. The remaining 11 debts totaled $39,646. Applicant admitted the \ndebts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c, 1.e, and 1.g \u2013 1.k. Although she denied the debts alleged \nin SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b, 1.d, and 1.f on the basis that the underlying accounts were \nfraudulently opened in her name, she accepted responsibility for paying them. (AE I; \nItem 5 at 4; Item 6 at 2) \n \nThe debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b, and 1.d are three credit union accounts \ntotaling $29,180. The debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.f is an $833 online retailer charge \naccount. These four accounts were opened in 2014. Applicant was not aware of them \nuntil she reviewed a credit report in about May 2017. After investigating the matter and \n\n \n3 \n \ndiscovering that neither she nor her husband had opened the accounts, she deemed it \nto be fraudulent activity. She contacted several attorneys, each of whom advised her to \npay or otherwise resolve the accounts with the creditors because of the high legal costs \nassociated with disputing them and her delayed detection of the suspected fraud. \nFollowing advice of counsel, Applicant and her husband accepted responsibility for \nrepaying the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b, 1.d, and 1.f. They also chose not to \nformally contest them by filing police reports or disputes with the credit bureau \nagencies. (Item 2 at 3; Item 3 at 32-33; Item 4 at 2; Item 5 at 5 and 8) \n \nIn April 2018, Applicant and her husband engaged the services of a debt relief \nprogram (DRP) to assist them in resolving their delinquent debts. They anticipated that \nthe working with the DRP would afford them the opportunity to negotiate reasonable \nsettlements that they could afford without jeopardizing their finances. In January 2019, \nthey retained a credit monitoring agency to assist them with monitoring their credit for \nfraudulent activity. The process for resolving debts through the DRP is: 1) Applicant and \nher husband make bi-weekly deposits of $347 into their DRP savings account; 2) once \nsufficient funds build up in the savings account, the DRP negotiates agreements with \ncreditors to settle the enrolled accounts, in an order determined by the DRP. Because it \ntakes time to accumulate sufficient funds for the larger debts, they take the longest time \nto resolve. The estimated timeframe for resolving them is 24 to 48 months. (AE F; Item \n2 at 3; Item 4 at 2 and 6) \n \nFrom April 2018 through August 2019, Applicant and her husband made bi-\nweekly deposits of $347 into the DRP savings account, totaling approximately $12,716. \nThe debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a \u2013 1.f were enrolled in the DRP, none of which had \nbeen paid as of August 2019. However, the DRP negotiated settlement agreements in \nAugust 2019 for the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c and 1.e to be paid from DRP funds, \nthe balance of which was not specified in the record. (AE F; FORM Response 1). \n \nIn 2017, Applicant made monthly payments of $300 directly to the creditor of the \ndebt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.c, reducing the balance from $6,870 to $3,172. She stopped \nthose payments once the debt was enrolled in the DRP. Between May 2019 and August \n2019, Applicant resolved, directly with the creditors, the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.g \u2013 \n1.k, which totaled $1,743. (Item 2 at 2; Item 6 at 2; AE C \u2013 J; FORM Response 1) \n \nApplicant attributed her debts to fraudulent activity, an extended illness, utilizing \ncredit cards for household expenses that exceeded her family\u2019s income, and an \nautomobile accident. She did not provide any specific details concerning her \noverspending, but averred that she did not spend money on anything extravagant. She \ncurrently spends within her means and has not accumulated any new debts since 2017. \nHer debt resolution plan includes continuing to work with the DRP, and using a portion \nof the equity from the sale of her home to resolve her remaining debts. The closing is \nscheduled for the end of September 2019. (AE K; Item 4 at 2-3Items 5 and 6; FORM \nResponse 2) \n \n \n \n\n \n4 \n \nPolicies \n \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d (Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988)). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d (Egan at 527). \nThe President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant \napplicants eligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d (EO 10865 \u00a7 2). \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the AG. These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, \nrecognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge applies these \nguidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative \njudge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available and reliable information about the \nperson, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \n \n \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d (EO 10865 \u00a7 \n7). Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \n \n \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in \nthe personal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant \nfrom being eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden \nof establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. (Egan, 484 U.S. at 531). \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d (See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994)). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the \ncriteria listed therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. (ISCR Case No. 92-1106 at \n3, 1993 WL 545051 at *3 (App. Bd. Oct. 7, 1993)). Once the Government establishes a \ndisqualifying condition by substantial evidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to \nrebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts. (Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15). An applicant has \nthe burden of proving a mitigating condition, and the burden of disproving it never shifts \nto the Government. (ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005)). \n \n\n \n5 \n \n  \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d (ISCR Case No. \n01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002)). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should \nerr, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d (Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; AG \u00b6 2(b)). \n \nAnalysis \n \n \nGuideline F (Financial Considerations) \nThe concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \n \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds . . . .  \n \n \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified information to raise money. It encompasses concerns about a \nperson\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting classified \ninformation. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information. (ISCR \nCase No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012).  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s admissions and her credit reports establish two disqualifying \nconditions under this guideline: AG \u00b6 19(a) (inability to satisfy debts), and AG \u00b6 19(c) (a \nhistory of not meeting financial obligations). \n \n \nThe security concerns raised in the SOR have been mitigated by the following \napplicable factors: \n \nAG \u00b6 20(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not \ncast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \nAG \u00b6 20(d): the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to \nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and  \n \nAG \u00b6 20(e): the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy \nof the past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides  \n \n \n\n \n6 \n \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \n \nApplicant established AG \u00b6 20(e) as to the debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.l because it is \na duplicate of the debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.e. In her SOR answer, Applicant denied the \ndebts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b, 1.d, and 1.f on the basis that the underlying accounts \nwere fraudulently opened in her name. However, Applicant accepted responsibility and \ninitiated action to resolve them along with her other delinquent debts well before the \nissuance of the April 2019 SOR.  \n \nIn 2017, Applicant made monthly payments of $300 directly to the creditor to \nreduce the balance of the debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.c from $6,870 to $3,172. In April \n2018, she engaged the services of the DRP to assist in resolving her delinquent debts, \nincluding those alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a \u2013 1.f. In January 2019, she hired a company to \nhelp monitor her credit for fraudulent activity. From April 2018 through August 2019, \nApplicant and her husband made bi-weekly deposits of $347 into the DRP savings \naccount, totaling approximately $12,716. Between May 2019 and August 2019, \nApplicant resolved, directly with the creditors, the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.g \u2013 1.k, \nwhich totaled $1,743. The DRP negotiated settlement agreements in August 2019 for \nthe debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c and 1.e to be paid from DRP funds. \n \nApplicant has established a reasonable plan to resolve her remaining delinquent \ndebts by continuing to work with the DRP, and by using a portion of the equity from the \nSeptember 2019 sale of her home. While Applicant is not currently debt-free, her \nactions, both before and after the SOR was issued, demonstrate that she will follow \nthrough with her plan.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s financial indebtedness occurred under circumstances not likely to \nrecur. She initiated and is adhering to good-faith efforts to resolve her delinquent debts. \nShe is currently managing her finances responsibly. I have no lingering doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment in light of the responsible \nmanner in which she is addressing her delinquent debts. I conclude that AG \u00b6\u00b6 20 (a), \n(c), and (d) are established, and find SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a \u2013 1.l in Applicant\u2019s favor.  \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether the granting or continuing \nof national security eligibility is clearly consistent with the interests of national security \nmust be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful consideration of the \nfollowing guidelines, each of which is to be evaluated in the context of the whole person. \nAn administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at \nAG \u00b6 2(d): \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \n\n \n7 \n \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nI have incorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-person \nanalysis, and I have considered the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). After weighing the disqualifying \nand mitigating conditions under Guideline F, and evaluating all the evidence in the \ncontext of the whole person, I conclude that Applicant has mitigated the security \nconcerns raised by her financial indebtedness. Accordingly, Applicant has carried her \nburden of showing that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant her \neligibility for access to classified information. \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required by Section \nE3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:   \nFOR APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.l:   \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nI conclude that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to continue \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.

Applicant did not submit a \n\n \n2 \n \n \nresponse to the FORM. Based on a review of the case file, eligibility for access to \nclassified information is denied. \n \nAdministrative Notice \n \nDepartment Counsel requested that I take administrative notice of relevant facts \nabout India. The request and supporting documents are attached to the record (Item 7). \nApplicant did not object to the documents. I took administrative notice as requested by \nDepartment Counsel. The facts administratively noticed are set out below in my findings \nof fact. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn his answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted the factual allegations in the SOR \nunder Guideline B (Foreign Influence) and offered explanations. (Item 1) He provided no \nadditional information to support his case. His admissions in his answer are \nincorporated in my findings of fact. (Item 3) \n \n \nApplicant was born in India in 1951. He received his undergraduate degree and \none graduate degree in India before coming to the United States in 1988. He was \nsponsored by his wife\u2019s brother. (Item 6) In 1995, he received his master\u2019s degree in the \nUnited States. He did not serve in the military in India.  He has worked as a self-\nemployed financial agent and a professor since 2007. He is being sponsored for a \nsecurity clearance by a linguistic company.  He became a naturalized U.S. citizen in \nJuly 1994. (Item 3)  This is his first application for a security clearance. (Item 4) \n \nApplicant married in India in 1980. His wife is also is a native of India, but is now \na naturalized U.S. citizen. He has two children who were born in India, but are now \nnaturalized U.S. citizens. He and his family live in a home that he purchased in 1996. \n(Item 4) The value of the house is about $350,000. Applicant has savings accounts and \na retirement account. (Item 6) \n \nApplicant maintains a bank account in India with about USD $45,000. (SOR 1.d) \nHe used this money to maintain inherited property in India. At times, he also provides \nfinancial assistance to his nephews and nieces, citizens and residents of India.   (Items \n3-6)  \n \nWhen Applicant\u2019s parents died in 1987, he inherited land which is usable \nfarmland and worth approximately USD $250,000. (Item 5) The land is maintained by \nApplicant\u2019s brothers. (SOR 1.e) He stated that he is thinking of selling the properties in \nthe future, but it is difficult to live in the United States and sell property in a country \nwhere he has renounced his birth citizenship. He will enlist the help of his brothers to \nsell the property at some time. \n \nIn 2009, Applicant and his family were issued Overseas Citizen of India travel \ncards which allows individuals of Indian origin to travel to and within India. Applicant \n\n \n3 \n \n \ndisclosed on his 2018 SCA that had traveled to India to visit friends and family members \nfive times between 2011 and 2016. (Item 4) \n \n \nApplicant has two brothers who are citizens and residents of India. (SOR 1.a)  \n(Item 3) He communicates with his brothers but states that the contacts are casual and \ninfrequent. One of his brothers retired from the Indian Air Force. Applicant is in weekly \ncontact with him and has provided him with approximately $20,000 in financial support.  \n \n \nApplicant has a middle brother who is a dual citizen of the United States and \nIndia. His brother resides in India. (SOR 1.b) He states that he has a relationship with \nhim that would not put him in a position of having to choose between his patriotism for \nthe United States and his brother. Applicant states that he does not influence or control \nwhat his brother does or the decisions in his life. (Item 3) \n \n \nApplicant has two sisters who are citizens and residents of India. (SOR 1.c) He is \nin contact with them on a weekly to monthly basis. (Items 4, 5). One sister is a \nhousewife and Applicant has provided her with about $20,000 financially. His other \nsister is a retired college teacher. (Item 5) \n \n \n Applicant states that his loyalty to the United States is such that he would not be \nsubject to foreign influence or pressure from India. He and his wife and children are \nnaturalized U.S. citizens. He has been in the United States for many years. None of his \nbrothers or sisters have asked him about his work. His family is not associated with any \nterrorist organizations or military groups. He was candid in that he stated that he has \naffection for India because that is where his siblings live. (Item 6) He was also candid \nwhen he noted that there is always a security risk due to his family living in India, but he \nthinks he would be okay. (Item 6) \n \n \nApplicant did not provide additional information concerning his financial status in \nthe United States. He stated that he is loyal to the United States and has been here for \nalmost 20 years. (Item 2) \n \nAdministrative Notice  \n \n \nIndia is a multiparty, federal, parliamentary democracy, with a bicameral \nparliament and a population of approximately 1.1 billion. Its political history since it \ngained independence from Great Britain in 1947 has included several armed conflicts \nwith Pakistan, assassinations of two prime ministers, sporadic outbreaks of religious \nriots, and violent attacks by several separatist and terrorist groups in different parts of \nthe country. There is a continuing threat from terrorism throughout the country, including \nattacks on targets where U.S. citizens or Westerners are known to congregate or visit.  \n \n \nIndia\u2019s size, population, and strategic location give it a prominent voice in \ninternational affairs. India has always been an active member of the United Nations. \nStarting this year, it is a non-permanent member of the Security Council, and it seeks a \npermanent seat on the Security Council. \n\n \n4 \n \n \nThe United States and India have differences over India\u2019s nuclear weapons \nprograms, the pace of India\u2019s economic reforms, and India\u2019s bilateral strategic \npartnership with Iran. Nevertheless, the United States recognizes that India is important \nto U.S. strategic interests. The strategic partnership between the United States and \nIndia is based on shared values such as democracy, pluralism, and the rule of law. \nSince 2002, the United States and India have held a series of substantive combined \nexercises involving all military services.  \nThe United States is India\u2019s largest foreign investment partner. Since December \n2006, direct civilian nuclear commerce with India has been permitted. The two countries \nhave a common interest in the free flow of commerce and resources, including through \nthe vital sea lanes of the Indian Ocean. \nThe United States and India share a common interest in fighting terrorism and in \ncreating a strategically stable Asia. They are seeking to foster bilateral relations by \nestablishing working groups to address (1) strategic cooperation; (2) energy and climate \nchange; (3) education and development; (4) economics, trade, and agriculture; and (5) \nscience and technology, health, and innovation.  \n \n \nIn the past, India had long-standing military supply relationships with the Soviet \nUnion, and Russia remains India\u2019s largest supplier of military systems and spare parts. \nIndia is one of many countries engaged in economic intelligence collection and \nindustrial espionage directed at the United States. The United States has longstanding \neconomic issues with India regarding protection of intellectual property rights and trade \nin dual-use technology. There have been numerous incidents of international \nbusinesses illegally exporting, or attempting to export restricted, dual-use technology \nfrom the United States to India. \n \n \nThe Indian Government generally respects the rights of its citizens, but there are \nserious problems involving abuses by police and security forces. Corruption in the \npolice force is pervasive, and police officers often act with impunity. Abuses by police \nand security forces have occurred primarily in criminal investigations and efforts to \nsuppress separatist and terrorist groups. There is no evidence that India uses torture or \nabuse against its citizens to extract economic intelligence.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \nPolicies \n \n \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended.   \n \n\n \n5 \n \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the AG. These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, \nrecognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge applies these \nguidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative \njudge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable. \n \n \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nabout potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d  See Exec. \nOr. 10865 \u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the \napplicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense \nhave established for issuing a clearance. \n \n \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in \nthe personal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant \nfrom being eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden \nof establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d  See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the \ncriteria listed therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 92-1106 \nat 3, 1993 WL 545051 at *3 (App. Bd. Oct. 7, 1993).   \n \n \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, \nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-\n31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).  \n \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. \n01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, \nif they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b).  \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n6 \n \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline B, Foreign Influence \n \n \nThe security concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 6: \n \nForeign contacts and interests may be a security concern if the individual \nhas divided loyalties or foreign financial interests, may be manipulated or \ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a \nway that is not in U.S. interests, or is vulnerable to pressure or coercion by \nany foreign interest. Adjudication under this Guideline can and should \nconsider the identity of the foreign country in which the foreign contact or \nfinancial interest is located, including, but not limited to, such \nconsiderations as whether the foreign country is known to target United \nStates citizens to obtain protected information and/or is associated with a \nrisk of terrorism. \n \n \nFour disqualifying conditions under this guideline are relevant to this case.  First, \na disqualifying condition may be raised by \u201ccontact with a foreign family member, \nbusiness or professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or resident \nin a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of foreign exploitation, \ninducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion.\u201d AG \u00b6 7(a). Second, a disqualifying \ncondition may be raised by \u201cconnections to a foreign person, group, government, or \ncountry that create a potential conflict of interest between the individual\u2019s obligation to \nprotect sensitive information or technology and the individual\u2019s desire to help a foreign \nperson, group, or country by providing that information.\u201d AG \u00b6 7(b). Third, a security \nconcern may be raised if an applicant is \u201csharing living quarters with a person or \npersons, regardless of citizenship status, if that relationship creates a heightened risk of \nforeign inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion.\u201d AG \u00b6 7(e). Fourth, AG \u00b6 7(f) \nmay be at issue \u201cif a substantial business, financial, or property interest in a foreign \ncountry, or in any foreign-owned or foreign-operated business, which could subject the \nindividual to heightened risk of foreign influence or exploitation\u201d is present.  \n \n \nGuideline B is not limited to countries hostile to the United States. \u201cThe United \nStates has a compelling interest in protecting and safeguarding classified information \nfrom any person, organization, or country that is not authorized to have access to it, \nregardless of whether that person, organization, or country has interests inimical to \nthose of the United States.\u201d  ISCR Case No. 02-11570 at 5 (App. Bd. May 19, 2004).  \n \n \nFurthermore, \u201ceven friendly nations can have profound disagreements with the \nUnited States over matters they view as important to their vital interests or national \nsecurity.\u201d ISCR Case No. 00-0317, (App. Bd. Mar. 29, 2002). Finally, we know friendly \nnations have engaged in espionage against the United States, especially in the \neconomic, scientific, and technical fields. Nevertheless, the nature of a nation\u2019s \ngovernment, its relationship with the United States, and its human rights record are \nrelevant in assessing the likelihood that an applicant\u2019s family members are vulnerable to \n\n \n7 \n \n \ngovernment coercion. The risk of coercion, persuasion, or duress is significantly greater \nif the foreign country has an authoritarian government, a family member is associated \nwith or dependent upon the government, or the country is known to conduct intelligence \noperations against the United States. In considering the nature of the government, an \nadministrative judge must also consider any terrorist activity in the country at issue. See \ngenerally ISCR Case No. 02-26130 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 7, 2006) (reversing decision to \ngrant clearance where administrative judge did not consider terrorist activity in area \nwhere family members resided). \n \n \nApplicant has lived in the United States since 1988. He is a naturalized U.S. \ncitizen. Applicant is married and his wife and children reside in the United States. His \nwife and children are naturalized U.S. citizens. \n \nApplicant\u2019s five siblings and other extended family live in India. One brother is a \nU.S. citizen, but resides in India.  A[T]here is a rebuttable presumption that a person has \nties of affection for, or obligation to, the immediate family members.@ ISCR Case No. \n01-03120, (App. Bd. Feb. 20, 2002). Applicant acknowledges that he maintains regular \ncontact with his family living in India. Applicant has not rebutted this presumption.  \n \nAfter considering the totality of Applicant\u2019s family ties to India as well as each \nindividual tie, I conclude that Applicant\u2019s family ties are sufficient to raise a heightened \nrisk of foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion. Applicant \nspeaks to his sisters by phone once or twice a week and he visits frequently. He has \nhad five visits to India from 2011 to 2018. Based on all these circumstances, I conclude \nthat AG \u00b6\u00b6 7(a), (b), and (e) are raised. Applicant owns farmable land in India worth \nabout $250,000, he has a bank account that is active in India and he has provided \nalmost $65,000 to various relatives in India. He may sell the property in the future. I \nconclude that AG \u00b6 7(f) is at issue due to the financial and property interest in India. \n \n \nSecurity concerns under this guideline can be mitigated by showing that \u201cthe \nnature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in which these persons are \nlocated, or the positions or activities of those persons in that country are such that it is \nunlikely the individual will be placed in a position of having to choose between the \ninterests of a foreign individual, group, organization, or government and the interests of \nthe U.S.\u201d AG \u00b6 8(a). India engages in economic and industrial espionage, and it has \nbeen involved in incidents involving illegal importation of restricted, dual-use technology \nfrom the United States. Applicant\u2019s siblings and nieces and nephews are citizens and \nresidents of India. He maintains close and regular contact with them. For these reasons, \nI conclude that AG\u00b6\u00b6 8(a) and 8(c) do not apply.  \n \n \nSecurity concerns under this guideline can be mitigated by showing \u201cthere is no \nconflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of loyalty or obligation to the \nforeign person, group, government, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such \ndeep and longstanding relationships and loyalties in the U.S., that the individual can be \nexpected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the U.S. interest.\u201d AG \u00b6 8(b). \nApplicant has held employment in the United States, but he has not held a security \n\n \n8 \n \n \nclearance. He did not provide sufficient information on which to base an opinion on how \nhe would resolve a conflict of interest.  Thus, I conclude that AG \u00b6 8(b) is not \nestablished.  \n \n \nAs to Applicant\u2019s property and land in India, he does not want to abandon it now \nbut might in the future. The value of both are about $ 250,000. He also maintains about \n$45,000 in an Indian bank account. Thus, I conclude that AG \u00b6 8(f) does not apply due \nto the financial and property interests in India that could result in a conflict. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. An administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guideline B in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 \n2(a) were addressed under that guideline, but some warrant additional comment. \n \n \nApplicant is a naturalized U.S. citizen who has lived in the United States since \n1988. He is married and his wife and two children are naturalized U.S. citizens.  \nApplicant owns a house in the United States, but did not provide any additional \ninformation to supplement the record in this case.  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s siblings are citizens and residents of India. He visits and maintains \nfrequent contact with them. Over the years, he has given them sums of money and he \nacknowledged that he has nieces and nephews living in India.  In addition, he has land, \nand a bank account in India. He has substantial foreign financial interests. He did not \nprovide any evidence on which to refute or mitigate the concerns about foreign influence \nin this case. \n \n \nIndia is a partner of the United States in the global war on terrorism. There is no \nevidence any of the individuals at issue are involved with, or under scrutiny, by interests \n\n \n9 \n \n \nantithetical to the United States. Applicant returned to India on several occasions to see \nhis family. \n \n \nApplicant bears the burden in the case. He did not provide evidence indicating \nthat he is exempt from manipulation to help a foreign power or interest. Applicant has \nnot mitigated the security concerns. There is insufficient information to provide \nmitigation. In light of these facts and the country at issue, I find that Applicant has not \nsuccessfully mitigated foreign influence concerns.  \n \n \nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under Guideline B, and \nevaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has \nnot mitigated the security concerns based on foreign influence. Accordingly, I conclude \nhe has not carried his burden of showing that it is clearly consistent with the national \ninterest to grant him eligibility for access to classified information. \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline B:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.e: \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant \nApplicant eligibility for a security clearance.

Applicant was married in 1984, and he has two children, born in 1993 and 1995. Personal Conduct Applicant has been consuming alcohol since he was 18 years old. From that point, to when he was married in 1984, he consumed an unspecified amount of beer primarily on weekends. Since 1984, Applicant generally drank one beer with dinner, once a month, on average. He contended that the only exceptions to his stated consumption amount and frequency occurred when he was arrested in 2003 and 2013 for operating a vehicle under the influence of liquor or drugs (DUI).

Connelley, Esquire, Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro se \n10/07/2019\n______________\nDecision \n______________\nGALES, Robert Robinson, Administrative Judge: \nApplicant failed to mitigate the security concerns regarding personal conduct. \nEligibility for a security clearance is denied. \nStatement of the Case \nOn March 16, 2017, Applicant applied for a security clearance and submitted an \nElectronic Questionnaires for Investigations Processing (e-QIP) version of a Security \nClearance Application. On May 31, 2019, the Department of Defense (DOD) \nConsolidated Adjudications Facility (CAF) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to him, \nunder Executive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \nIndustry (February 20, 1960), as amended and modified; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense \nIndustrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended \nand modified (Directive); and Directive 4 of the Security Executive Agent (SEAD 4), \nNational Security Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) (December 10, 2016) for all covered \nindividuals who require initial or continued eligibility for access to classified information or \neligibility to hold a sensitive position, effective June 8, 2017. \n\n \n2 \n                                      \n \nThe SOR alleged security concerns under Guideline E (Personal Conduct), and \ndetailed reasons why the DOD adjudicators were unable to find that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant. The SOR \nrecommended referral to an administrative judge to determine whether a clearance \nshould be granted, continued, denied, or revoked.  \n \n \nIn a notarized statement dated June 10, 2019, Applicant responded to the SOR \nand elected to have his case decided on the written record in lieu of a hearing. A complete \ncopy of the Government\u2019s file of relevant material (FORM) was mailed to Applicant by the \nDefense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) on July 15, 2019, and he was afforded \nan opportunity, within a period of 30 days, to file objections and submit material in \nrefutation, extenuation, or mitigation. In addition to the FORM, Applicant was furnished a \ncopy of the Directive as well as the Adjudicative Guidelines applicable to his case. \nApplicant received the FORM on July 24, 2019. His response was due on August 23, \n2019. Applicant timely submitted one document, which was accepted without objection. \nThe case was assigned to me on September 6, 2019.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nIn his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted, with comments, all of the factual \nallegations pertaining to personal conduct (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a. through 1.d.). Applicant\u2019s \nadmissions and accompanying comments are incorporated herein as findings of fact. \nAfter a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, and upon due \nconsideration of same, I make the following additional findings of fact:  \n \nApplicant is a 60-year-old employee of a defense contractor.

A 1977 high school graduate, he received a bachelor\u2019s degree in 1982, and a \nmaster\u2019s degree in 1986. He has never served in the U.S. military. In his 2017 e-QIP, \nApplicant reported that he had never been granted a security clearance, but in his Answer \nto the SOR, he said that he had been granted one in June 2007. Applicant was married \nin 1984, and he has two children, born in 1993 and 1995.  \n \nPersonal Conduct \n \n \nApplicant has been consuming alcohol since he was 18 years old. From that point, \nto when he was married in 1984, he consumed an unspecified amount of beer primarily \non weekends. Since 1984, Applicant generally drank one beer with dinner, once a month, \non average. He contended that the only exceptions to his stated consumption amount \nand frequency occurred when he was arrested in 2003 and 2013 for operating a vehicle \nunder the influence of liquor or drugs (DUI). (Item 3, at 4) He claimed that both of those \nincidents, described further below, occurred when he was \u201cunexpectedly invited\u201d to \ndinner. (Answer to the SOR, at 2)  \n \nApplicant estimated that it would take around two to three beers to become \nintoxicated or \u201cbuzzed\u201d as he described it. Besides his two DUIs, Applicant claims that \nalcohol has not caused or contributed to any other problems in his life. He denied having \n\n \n3 \n                                      \n \nreceived any alcohol treatment or counseling. He denies having a problem with alcohol, \nand he intends to continue his current use of alcohol. (Item 3, at 4-5) \n \nOn June 30, 2003, Applicant and work colleagues were celebrating a new contract \nthat had been awarded to their employer, and he was invited to join the group for an after-\nwork dinner. During dinner, he consumed five beers. While driving home, his vehicle side-\nswiped a guard rail, and he was stopped by the police. Applicant was administered a field \nsobriety test, which he failed, and he was arrested and charged with DUI. He was \neventually transported to a location where he was administered a breathalyzer test, and \nit registered .10 percent blood alcohol content (BAC). (Item 3, at 4) On December 3, 2003, \nApplicant appeared in court. Although he entered a plea of not guilty, he was found guilty \nas charged. He was fined a total of $607; his operator\u2019s license was revoked for six \nmonths; and he was ordered to attend the Intoxicated Driver Resource Center (IDRC) for \na two-day, 12-hour educational/screening program. (Item 5; Item 3, at 4) \n \nApplicant contends that when he attended the IDRC program, he was informed by \nan unidentified source that a DUI is not a criminal offense, but rather it is considered a \ndriving violation. Because he wanted to get or keep a particular job, when Applicant \nsubsequently completed an e-QIP in December 2006, he reportedly asked his employer \nand the security officer if he had to include \u201cdriving violations\u201d on his e-QIP, and he said \nthey told him that \u201cdriving violations\u201d did not need to be included. Accordingly, Applicant \ndid not include his 2003 DUI on his e-QIP. (Answer to the SOR, at 3; Response to the \nFORM) That action was not alleged in the SOR. Applicant\u2019s description of a DUI in the \nstate where the DUIs occurred is correct, for a DUI in that state is considered merely a \ntraffic violation, and not a criminal misdemeanor, except in certain instances. \n \nUnalleged conduct can be considered for certain purposes, as discussed by the \nDOHA Appeal Board. (Conduct not alleged in an SOR may be considered: (a) to assess \nan applicant's credibility; (b) to evaluate an applicant's evidence of extenuation, \nmitigation, or changed circumstances; (c) to consider whether an applicant has \ndemonstrated successful rehabilitation; (d) to decide whether a particular provision of the \nAdjudicative Guidelines is applicable; or (e) to provide evidence for whole-person analysis \nunder Directive \u00a7 6.3.). See ISCR Case No. 03-20327 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, 2006); (citing \nISCR Case No. 02-07218 at 3 (App. Bd. Mar. 15, 2004); ISCR Case No. 00-0633 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Oct. 24, 2003)). See also ISCR Case No. 12-09719 at 3 (App. Bd. April 6, 2016) \n(citing ISCR Case No. 14-00151 at 3, n. 1 (App. Bd. Sept. 12, 2014); ISCR Case No. 03-\n20327 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, 2006)). Applicant\u2019s unalleged omission, concealment, and \nfalsification regarding his history of alcohol consumption described above, will be \nconsidered only for the five purposes listed above. \n \nOn February 14, 2013, after attending a funeral of a high school classmate, \nApplicant claims he was unexpectedly invited to have dinner with some other high school \nfriends. He furnished two versions of what occurred next. During his July 2018 interview \nwith an investigator from the U.S. Office of Personnel Management (OPM), he said he \nconsumed one glass of wine with dinner, and then the group went to a bar where, over a \nperiod of around two hours, he consumed three beers. (Item 3, at 3) However, in his \nAnswer to the SOR, Applicant said he consumed three glasses of wine with dinner, and \n\n \n4 \n                                      \n \nhe made no mention of consuming alcohol at a bar. (Answer to the SOR, at 2) Applicant \nleft his final drinking location on February 15, 2013, and while driving home, at about \n12:15 a.m., he fell asleep and crashed into a telephone poll. Applicant was administered \na field sobriety test, which he failed, and he was arrested and charged with DUI. He was \neventually transported to a location where he was administered a breathalyzer test, and \nit registered .10 percent BAC. (Item 3, at 3) On September 11, 2013, Applicant appeared \nin court. Although he entered a plea of not guilty, he was found guilty as charged. He was \nfined a total of $864; his operator\u2019s license was revoked for two years; he was ordered to \nattend the IDRC for a two-day, 12-hour educational/screening program; he was ordered \nto perform 30 days of community service; and he was required to have an interlock device \ninstalled on his vehicle for one year. (Item 4; Item 3, at 3-4) \n \nThe SOR alleged that Applicant did not report his February 2013 DUI arrest and \nconviction to his facility security officer as required by the National Industrial Security \nProgram Operating Manual (NISPOM), Chapter 1, Section 3, Paragraph 1-300. Applicant \nadmitted the allegation, but he claimed that he did not think it was necessary to do so \nbecause he had received a security clearance in June 2007 after his earlier DUI. (Answer \nto the SOR, at 3) The cited reference states: \n \nContractors are required to report certain events that have an impact on the \nstatus of the facility clearance (FCL), that impact on the status of an \nemployee\u2019s personnel clearance (PCL), that affect proper safeguarding of \nclassified information, or that indicate classified information has been lost \nor compromised. Contractors shall establish such internal procedures as \nare necessary to ensure that cleared employees are aware of their \nresponsibilities for reporting pertinent information to the FSO, the Federal \nBureau of Investigation (FBI), or other Federal authorities as required by \nthis Manual, the terms of a classified contract, and U.S. law. Contractors \nshall provide complete information to enable the [Cognizant Security \nAgency] to ascertain whether classified information is adequately protected. \nContractors shall submit reports to the FBI, and to their CSA, as specified \nin this Section. \n \n \nNISPOM Chapter 1, Section 3, Paragraph 1-302, addresses reports that contain \nadverse information that contractors are supposed to submit to their CSA, and NISPOM \nAppendix C provides the following definition of \u201cAdverse Information\u201d: \n \nAny information that adversely reflects on the integrity or character of a \ncleared employee, that suggests that his or her ability to safeguard \nclassified information may be impaired, or that his or her access to classified \ninformation clearly may not be in the interest of national security. \n \nOn March 16, 2017, when Applicant completed his e-QIP, he responded to a \nquestion pertaining to his consumption of alcohol found in Section 22 \u2013 Police Record. \nThat question, and the one alleged in the SOR, was as follows: \u201dHave you EVER been \ncharged with an offense involving alcohol or drugs?\u201d Applicant answered \u201cno\u201d to the \nquestion. (Item 2, at 23) He omitted and concealed his two admitted DUI arrest and \n\n \n5 \n                                      \n \nconvictions. He certified that his response to that question was \u201ctrue, complete, and \ncorrect\u201d to the best of his knowledge and belief, but, because of his omission and \nconcealment, the response to that question was, in fact, false. Applicant subsequently \nexplained that his response was based on the same reasoning that he used when he \ncompleted his December 2006 e-QIP: a \u201cdriving violation\u201d was not required to be reported.  \n \nPolicies \n \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the Executive \nBranch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security emphasizing, \n\u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d (Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. \n518, 528 (1988)) As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to control \naccess to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual \nis sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information. The President has \nauthorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant an applicant eligibility for \naccess to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to do so.\u201d (Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \nIndustry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified.)   \n    \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the guidelines in SEAD 4. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the guidelines list potentially disqualifying \nconditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility \nfor access to classified information. \n \nAn administrative judge need not view the guidelines as inflexible, ironclad rules \nof law. Instead, acknowledging the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. The entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known \nas the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a meaningful decision. \n \nIn the decision-making process, facts must be established by \u201csubstantial \nevidence.\u201d \u201cSubstantial evidence [is] such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might \naccept as adequate to support a conclusion in light of all contrary evidence in the record.\u201d  \n(ISCR Case No. 04-11463 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2006) (citing Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1)).  \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d  (See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994).) \n \n The Government initially has the burden of producing evidence to establish a \npotentially disqualifying condition under the Directive, and has the burden of establishing \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Once the Government has produced substantial \nevidence of a disqualifying condition, under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant has the \nburden of persuasion to present evidence in refutation, explanation, extenuation or \nmitigation, sufficient to overcome the doubts raised by the Government\u2019s case. The \n\n \n6 \n                                      \n \nburden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government. (See ISCR \nCase No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).) \n  \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours as well. It is \nbecause of this special relationship that the Government must be able to repose a high \ndegree of trust and confidence in those individuals to whom it grants access to classified \ninformation. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the \napplicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. Such \ndecisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather \nthan actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Furthermore, \u201csecurity clearance \ndeterminations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d (Egan, 484 U.S. at 531) \n \nClearance decisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense \nbe a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d (See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 \n7)  Thus, nothing in this decision should be construed to suggest that I have based this \ndecision, in whole or in part, on any express or implied determination as to Applicant\u2019s \nallegiance, loyalty, or patriotism. It is merely an indication the Applicant has or has not \nmet the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for \nissuing a clearance.  In reaching this decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that \nare reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I \nhave avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Personal Conduct is set out in \nAG \u00b6 15: \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. The following will normally result in \nan unfavorable national security eligibility determination, security clearance \naction, or cancellation of further processing for national security eligibility: \n \n(a) refusal, or failure without reasonable cause, to undergo or cooperate \nwith security processing, including but not limited to meeting with a security \ninvestigator for subject interview, completing security forms or releases, \ncooperation with medical or psychological evaluation, or polygraph \nexamination, if authorized and required; and \n \n\n \n7 \n                                      \n \n(b) refusal to provide full, frank, and truthful answers to lawful questions of \ninvestigators, security officials, or other official representatives in \nconnection with a personnel security or trustworthiness determination. \n \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could raise security \nconcerns for Personal Conduct under AG \u00b6 16: \n \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar \nform used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, \naward benefits or status, determine national security eligibility or \ntrustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities;  \n \n(b) deliberately providing false or misleading information; or concealing or \nomitting information, concerning relevant facts to an employer, investigator, \nsecurity official, competent medical or mental health professional involved \nin making a recommendation relevant to a national security eligibility \ndetermination, or other official government representative; and \n \n(c) credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is \nnot sufficient for an adverse determination under any other single guideline, \nbut which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-person \nassessment of questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack \nof candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations, or other \ncharacteristics indicating that the individual may not properly safeguard \nclassified or sensitive information. \n \nExcessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable \njudgment, and can raise questions about an individual's reliability and trustworthiness. As \nnoted above, Applicant was convicted of DUI in both 2003 and 2013. He failed to report \nhis 2013 DUI to his FSO, and when he submitted his 2017 e-QIP, he omitted and \nconcealed both of the DUIs and falsified his response to an inquiry that asked: \u201dHave you \nEVER been charged with an offense involving alcohol or drugs?\u201d That response was \nfalse, and Applicant was somewhat disingenuous in claiming that since a DUI in that \nparticular state is not a criminal offense, he could deny the DUIs because they were \n\u201cdriving violations.\u201d The specific language of the question was \u201can offense involving \nalcohol,\u201d not a \u201ccriminal offense\u201d involving alcohol. Furthermore, Applicant\u2019s statement \nthat he previously inquired of his employer and FSO about \u201cdriving violations,\u201d not \nspecifically a DUI, seems to indicate that he carefully avoided referring to his \u201cdriving \nviolation\u201d as being alcohol-related. With respect to SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a. and 1.b., AG \u00b6 16(c) \napplies. With respect to SOR \u00b6 1.c., AG \u00b6 16(a) applies. However, with respect to SOR \u00b6 \n1.d., AG \u00b6 16(b) has not been established for the reasons set forth below.  \n \nThe NISPOM clearly requires that contractors report certain events that have an \nimpact on the status of an employee\u2019s personnel clearance, and that in doing so, \ncontractors shall establish such internal procedures as are necessary to ensure that \ncleared employees are aware of their responsibilities for reporting pertinent information. \n\n \n8 \n                                      \n \nIn this instance, there is no evidence that the contractor fulfilled its responsibilities to train \nits employees generally, or Applicant specifically, on what types of incidents are required \nto be reported. The NISPOM does not specify, using examples such as drug involvement, \nmaladaptive alcohol use, failure to file income tax returns, etc., other than generally, as \nto what types of incidents constitute adverse information. While a DUI may constitute \nsuch an incident, it is unclear if it might adversely reflect on the integrity or character of a \ncleared employee such as Applicant, or if it suggests that his ability to safeguard classified \ninformation may be impaired.  \n \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions under AG \u00b6 17 that could \nmitigate security concerns arising from Personal Conduct. They include: \n \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts;  \n \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; and \n \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate vulnerability \nto exploitation, manipulation, or duress. \n \nNone of the conditions apply. Although Applicant finally revealed his history of \nalcohol consumption and the alcohol-related incidents associated with it during his July \n2018 OPM interview, he made no efforts to correct the omission, concealment, or \nfalsification associated with his 2017 e-QIP. Although a DUI in the state where these two \noccurred is not considered a criminal offense, it is not a minor offense. While there were \ntwo DUIs during on ten-year period, neither of the DUIs happened under unique \ncircumstances. Furthermore, because Applicant\u2019s future intention is to continue his \ncurrent usage of alcohol, believing he has no problem with alcohol, it is not unlikely that \nthat history will repeat itself if Applicant should be \u201cunexpectedly invited\u201d to dinner where \nhe will consume alcohol to excess. Applicant\u2019s lack of candor, and his attitude towards \nlaws, rules, and regulations while seeking eligibility for a security clearance, under the \ncircumstances continue to cast doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, and good \njudgment. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6 2(d): \n  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \n\n \n9 \n                                      \n \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nUnder SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. Moreover, I have \nevaluated the various aspects of this case in light of the totality of the record evidence \nand have not merely performed a piecemeal analysis. (See U.S. v. Bottone, 365 F.2d \n389, 392 (2d Cir. 1966); See also ISCR Case No. 03-22861 at 2-3 (App. Bd. Jun. 2, 2006))  \n  \nThere is some evidence mitigating Applicant\u2019s conduct. Applicant is a 60-year-old \nemployee of a defense contractor. He has been serving as a senior member of the \nengineering staff with his current employer since December 2006. A 1977 high school \ngraduate, he received a bachelor\u2019s degree in 1982, and a master\u2019s degree in 1986. \nApplicant was granted a security clearance in June 2007. \n \nThe disqualifying evidence under the whole-person concept is more substantial. \nApplicant is not a reliable or candid historian regarding his history of maladaptive alcohol \nuse because of his inconsistent statements in which he either denied, concealed, or \nomitted significant portions of his history. Applicant claimed that since 1984, he generally \ndrank one beer with dinner, once a month, on average. He also contended that the only \nexceptions to his stated consumption amount and frequency occurred when he was \narrested in 2003 and 2013 for DUI. He claimed that both of those incidents occurred when \nhe was \u201cunexpectedly invited\u201d to dinner. In both his 2006 and 2017 e-QIPs, Applicant \nomitted and concealed the DUIs and falsified his response to an inquiry that asked: \u201dHave \nyou EVER been charged with an offense involving alcohol or drugs?\u201d Instead of being \ncandid, Applicant chose to ignore the clear meaning of the question about offenses \ninvolving alcohol, and instead substituted the words \u201cdriving violations,\u201d without any \nrelationship with alcohol.  \n \nOverall, the evidence leaves me with substantial questions and doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all of these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant has failed to mitigate the security concerns arising from his personal \nconduct. See SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6\u00b6 2(d)(1) through AG 2(d)(9). \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline E:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a. through 1.c.:  \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.d.:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n\n \n10 \n                                      \n \nConclusion \n \n \n In light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n \n \n                                    \n         \n \n \n__________________________ \nROBERT ROBINSON GALES \nAdministrative Judge \n",

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant is a 45-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has worked for his current employer since 2001. He served on active duty in the U.S. military from 1996 until he was honorably discharged in 2001. He seeks to retain a security clearance, which he has held for an extended period. He has a bachelor\u2019s degree, which was awarded in 2008, and a master\u2019s degree, which was awarded in 2011. He is married with two children and a stepchild. (Transcript (Tr.) at 25-29; GE 1, 3) The SOR alleges five defaulted student loans with balances totaling $116,887, as listed on an April 2019 credit report. The three student loans alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c through 1.e total $57,022. The three loans are serviced by the same company and collected through one payment. Applicant documented that he has been regularly paying the loans since May 2014, albeit possibly not at the rate required by his loan agreements.

Eligibility for \naccess to classified information is granted.\nStatement of the Case \n \nOn May 6, 2019, the Department of Defense (DOD) issued a Statement of \nReasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing security concerns under Guideline F, financial \nconsiderations. Applicant responded to the SOR on May 22, 2019, and requested a \nhearing before an administrative judge. The case was assigned to me on August 2, \n2019.  \n \nThe hearing was convened as scheduled on October 31, 2019. Government \nExhibits (GE) 1 through 6 were admitted without objection. Applicant testified and \nsubmitted Applicant\u2019s Exhibits (AE) A through E, which were admitted without objection. \nThe record was held open for Applicant to submit additional information. He submitted \ndocuments that I have marked AE F and G and admitted without objection \n\n \n2 \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant is a 45-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has worked for \nhis current employer since 2001. He served on active duty in the U.S. military from 1996 \nuntil he was honorably discharged in 2001. He seeks to retain a security clearance, \nwhich he has held for an extended period. He has a bachelor\u2019s degree, which was \nawarded in 2008, and a master\u2019s degree, which was awarded in 2011. He is married \nwith two children and a stepchild. (Transcript (Tr.) at 25-29; GE 1, 3) \n \n \nThe SOR alleges five defaulted student loans with balances totaling $116,887, as \nlisted on an April 2019 credit report. The three student loans alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c \nthrough 1.e total $57,022. The three loans are serviced by the same company and \ncollected through one payment. Applicant documented that he has been regularly \npaying the loans since May 2014, albeit possibly not at the rate required by his loan \nagreements. When adjusted for reversals, he made four $275 payments, three $250 \npayments, and one $125 payment in 2014 ($1,975 total in 2014); ten $250 payments \nand one $500 payment in 2015 ($3,000 total in 2015); ten $250 payments in 2016 \n($2,500 total in 2016); eleven $250 payments in 2017 ($2,750 total in 2017); twelve \n$250 payments in 2018 ($3,000 total in 2018); and as of April 2019, four $250 payments \nin 2019 ($1,000 total as of April 2019). The total of his payments from 2014 through \nApril 2019 total $14,225, and as of May 2019, the balance was reduced to $56,773. He \ndocumented additional $250 payments, making the total amount paid more than \n$15,000 and reducing the balance to $55,523 as of October 2019. (Tr. at 18; GE 2, 4; \nAE A, B, D) \n \n \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a ($34,637) and 1.b ($25,228) allege defaulted student loans totaling \n$59,865 to the Department of Education. Applicant\u2019s wages were garnished about $361 \nevery two weeks starting in June 2017. $4,700 was garnished in 2017. An additional \n$1,467 was garnished through February 2018. The amount of additional payments is \nunclear, but the Department of Education reported that he paid $1,842 in interest in \n2018. (Tr. at 20-23; GE 1-4, 6; AE C, D) \n \n \nThe garnishment stopped in February or March 2018, and the loans were \ntransferred to a collection company. Applicant had some difficulty coordinating with the \ncollection company and only made sporadic payments. He paid $250 in September \n2018 and $200 in December 2018. An October 2019 credit reports lists both payments \n(September 2018 payment reported as $144 payment to one loan and $105 payment to \nsecond loan, and December 2018 payment reported as $115 payment to one loan and \n$84 payment to second loan). He credibly stated that he intends to pay his student \nloans. (Tr. at 19-24, 32-35, 40; GE 2-6; AE D, F, G) \n \nPolicies \n \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n\n \n3 \n \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG), which became \neffective on June 8, 2017. \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.  \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n4 \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18:       \n \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds.  \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case:   \n \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \n \nApplicant defaulted on his student loans. The evidence is sufficient to raise the \nabove disqualifying conditions. \n \n  \nConditions that could mitigate the financial considerations security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 20. The following are potentially applicable:  \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; and \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.  \n \n \nApplicant did not completely ignore his student loans. He has been paying three \nloans since May 2014. His payments total more than $15,000. The two Department of \nEducation loans are less straightforward. More than $6,100 was garnished in 2017 and \n2018. The garnishment stopped in February or March 2018, and the loans were \ntransferred to a collection company. Applicant had some difficulty coordinating with the \ncollection company and only made sporadic payments. I believe it was a matter of \u201cout \nof sight, out of mind.\u201d However, I also believe that he fully intends to pay his student \nloans, and that his efforts to pay all his loans will increase. The above mitigating \nconditions are applicable. \n\n \n5 \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. I also considered Applicant\u2019s \nhonorable military service. \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude Applicant \nmitigated the financial considerations security concerns.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.e: \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIt is clearly consistent with the national interest to continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility \nfor a security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \n \n \n \n________________________ \nEdward W. Loughran \nAdministrative Judge \n \n \n",

Crowley, Esq., Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro se  \n \nSeptember 10, 2019 \nDecision \n \nLokey Anderson, Darlene D., Administrative Judge: \nOn May 29, 2018, Applicant submitted a security clearance application (e-QIP). \nOn May 6, 2019, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications Facility (DoD \nCAF) issued Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR), detailing security under \nExecutive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February \n20, 1960), as amended; DoD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security \nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive).   \n \nApplicant responded to the SOR (Answer) on June 7, 2019. (Government Exhibit \n2.)  He requested that his case be decided by an administrative judge on the written \nrecord. Department Counsel submitted the Government\u2019s written case on July 1, 2019.   \nA complete copy of the File of Relevant Material (FORM), containing six Items, was \nreceived by Applicant on July 19, 2019.  He was afforded an opportunity to file \nobjections and submit material in refutation, extenuation, or mitigation within 30 days of \nreceipt of the FORM. Applicant submitted a response to the FORM consisting of eleven \npages, within the 30-day period.  DOHA assigned the case to me on August 20, 2019.  \n\n \n2 \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant is 55 years old and is married.  He has a high school diploma and \nmilitary training.  He is employed with a defense contractor as an Electrical Integration \nAnalyst.  Applicant began working for his current employer in May 2018.  A security \nclearance in necessary in connection with his employment.  Applicant served on active \nduty in the United States Navy from February 1984 until February 2004, when he was \nhonorably discharged.  \n \nGuideline F - Financial Considerations \n \n \n \nThe Government alleged that Applicant is ineligible for a clearance because he \nmade financial decisions that indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which raise questions about his \nreliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified information.  \n \nThe SOR alleges nine delinquent debts totaling approximately $60,000.  \nApplicant admitted to six of the debts, and denied three.  The three debts that Applicant \ndenied, he claims are no longer showing delinquent on his credit reports.  Applicant \nattributes his excessive indebtedness to an auto accident his daughter suffered in April \n2008, resulting in traumatic brain injury and permanent disability, as well as the fact that \nhis salary was significantly reduced by his employer in April 2014.  At that time, \nApplicant took a $12,000 per year salary reduction when a new contractor took over the \ngovernment contract and reduced the pay of the entire workforce.  Applicant states that \nhe went into debt having to purchase expensive medical equipment not covered by his \nmedical insurance for his daughter, such as shower chairs, mattresses and toilets \namong other things.  His reduction in salary only aggravated the problem.  Applicant \nhad difficulty meeting his financial obligations.   \n \nIt also appears that he may have spent more than he could afford simply \nbecause those debts that are not medical accounts are consumer debts.  To clean up \nhis credit standing and resolve his debt, Applicant hired a professional debt relief \ncompany on June 7, 2017.  At that time, he entered into a four year agreement with a \ndebt relief company which requires that he pay them $936 monthly, which is \nautomatically deducted from his bank account, that are dispersed to his creditors.  The \ndebt relief company negotiates and pays reduced settlements to the creditors to resolve \nthe debt.  (Government Exhibit 2.)  Since June 7, 2017, Applicant has continued with \nthis plan and has made regular monthly payments without interruption.  The Program \nProgress Summary from the debt relief company shows the debts included in the \nprogram, (which are each of those set forth in the SOR), the payment history, and the \nsettlement amounts.  (Applicant\u2019s Response to the FORM.)  Applicant will complete the \ndebt relief program in June 2021. \n  \nThe following debts were alleged on the SOR:  \n \n1(a) A delinquent debt owed to the Navy Federal Credit Union was charged off in \nthe approximate amount of $20,387.  Applicant has enrolled this debt with the debt relief \n\n \n3 \n \ncompany for resolution.  (Applicant\u2019s Response to the FORM.)  It appears from the \nProgram Progress Summary that this debt is still under negotiations.  Applicant intends \nto pay this debt off through the debt relief program.     \n \n1(b) A delinquent debt owed to the Navy Federal Credit Union was charged off in \nthe approximate amount of $16,657.  Applicant co-signed for this loan for his daughter \nand she did not inform him that she defaulted on the loan.  It appears form the Program \nProgress Summary that this debt is still under negotiations.  Applicant intends to pay \nthis debt off through the debt relief program.  (Applicant\u2019s Response to the FORM.) \n \n \n1(c) A delinquent credit card account was charged off in the approximate amount \nof $7,861.  Applicant has enrolled the debt with the debt relief company for resolution.  It \nappears from the Program Progress Summary that this debt has been resolved.  \n(Applicant\u2019s Response to the FORM.) \n \n \n1(d) A delinquent credit card account was charged off in the approximate amount \nof $6,047.  Applicant has enrolled the debt with the debt relief company for resolution.  It \nappears from the Program Progress Summary that this debt is being paid through the \ndebt relief program.  (Applicant\u2019s Response to the FORM.) \n \n \n1(e) A delinquent debt was placed for collection in the approximate amount of \n$5,942.  Applicant has enrolled the debt with the debt relief company for resolution.  It \nappears from the Program Progress Summary that this debt is being paid through the \ndebt relief program.  (Applicant\u2019s Response to the FORM.) \n \n \n1(f)   A delinquent medical account was placed for collection in the approximate \namount of $126.  Applicant states that the account is no longer showing delinquent on \nhis credit reports.  Applicant has paid the debt and has attached the receipt.  \n(Applicant\u2019s Response to the FORM.) \n \n \n1(g)  A delinquent medical account was placed for collection in the approximate \namount of $110.  Applicant states that the account is no longer showing delinquent on \nhis credit reports.  Applicant provided a copy of the receipt showing that he paid the \ndebt on July 26, 2019.  (Applicant\u2019s Response to the FORM.) \n \n \n1(h)  A delinquent medical account was placed for collection in the approximate \namount of $82.  Applicant states that the account is no longer showing delinquent on his \ncredit reports.  Applicant provided a copy of the receipt showing that he paid the debt on \nJuly 25, 2019.  (Applicant\u2019s Response to the FORM.)   \n \n \n1(i)  A delinquent debt owed to the Navy Federal Credit Union was charged off in \nthe approximate amount of $3,170.  Applicant has enrolled the debt with the debt relief \ncompany for resolution.  Applicant plans to pay the debt off through the debt relief \nprogram.  (Applicant\u2019s Response to the FORM.)   \n \n \nThere is also evidence that Applicant has resolved a debt, not alleged in the \nSOR, through the debt relief company.  (Applicant\u2019s Response to the FORM.)   \n\n \n4 \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious \nscrutiny of a number of variables known as the whole-person concept. The \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record.  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d  \n \n \nA person who applies for access to classified information seeks to enter into a \nfiduciary relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \n \n \n \n \n\n \n5 \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG \u00b6 18: \n \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. Three are potentially applicable in this case:   \n \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \n \n  \nApplicant has been delinquently indebted for some time now.  He believes his \nfinancial problems began in 2008 when his daughter suffered a traumatic brain injury \nand became permanently disabled.  Applicant was forced to spend money he did not \nhave to provide for her needs.  To complicate matters, in 2014 his salary at work was \nsignificantly reduced.  The evidence is sufficient to raise the above disqualifying \nconditions.  \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. I considered \nall of the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 including: \n \n(a)  the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \n(b)  the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \n\n \n6 \n \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control; \n \n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \notherwise resolve debts; and \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \n \nCircumstances beyond Applicant\u2019s control started his financial problems.    \nApplicant\u2019s daughter was in an auto accident that caused permanent damage.  In \naddition, several years later, Applicant\u2019s pay was significantly reduced because the \ncontract was picked up by another contractor who adjusted all of the pay for the \ncompany.  Understanding that he could not do it by himself, Applicant hired a debt relief \ncompany to assist him in resolving his debts.  Applicant has already paid off five of the \ndebts listed in the SOR.  He is continuing to follow the debt relief program and will have \nall of his debts resolved by June 2023.  There is nothing else in the record that leads \none to believe that Applicant is not forthcoming or that he has been unreasonable and \nirresponsible.  In fact, from Applicant\u2019s experience, it can be gleaned that he clearly \nunderstands the responsibilities required in holding a security clearance.  He knows that \nhe must live within his means at all times, and pay his bills in a timely manner.  So far, \nhe has acted reasonably and responsibly with respect to his debts.  Much of his \nsituation was not his fault, but can be attributed to the fact that he encountered \ncircumstances beyond his control.  Accordingly, it is found that his debts are now under \ncontrol.  Furthermore, Applicant has demonstrated that future financial problems are \nunlikely.  Mitigating conditions \u00b6 20 (a), (b), (c), and (d) are applicable.  There are clear \nindications that his financial problems are being resolved.  \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \n\n \n7 \n \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept.  \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline F in my whole-person analysis.  Applicant understands that he must live \nwithin his means and pay his debts in a timely fashion.  He must be responsible in every \naspect of his life.  Applicant has shown good judgment and reliability and demonstrated \nthat he is financially responsible.          \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions and doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant has mitigated the Financial Considerations security concerns.  \n \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a: through 1.i:  \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant national security eligibility \nfor a security clearance.

After a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, and upon due consideration of same, I make the following additional findings of fact: Applicant is a 27-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has been serving as an engineer/consultant with his current employer since June 2016. A 2011 high school graduate, Applicant received a bachelor\u2019s degree in 2015. He has never served with the U.S. military. He was granted a secret clearance in 2016, and he is currently being sponsored for a top secret clearance. Applicant has never been married, and he has no children. Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse Applicant was a recreational substance abuser whose primary substance of choice was marijuana, but he also used cocaine, and a prescribed anxiety medication (the prescription was for someone other than himself). In addition, although not alleged in the SOR, Applicant also used mushrooms and an unspecified prescription painkiller. He commenced what he called \u201csemi-regular use\u201d of marijuana in July 2011, and he continued using it periodically (anywhere from once or twice a month to 10 to 15 times per ",

Eligibility for a security clearance is denied. \nStatement of the Case \nOn June 23, 2016, and again on August 31, 2017, Applicant applied for a security \nclearance and submitted Electronic Questionnaires for Investigations Processing (e-QIP) \nversions of a Security Clearance Application. On June 24, 2019, the Department of \nDefense (DOD) Consolidated Adjudications Facility (CAF) issued a Statement of \nReasons (SOR) to him, under Executive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended and modified; \nDOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program \n(January 2, 1992), as amended and modified (Directive); and Directive 4 of the Security \nExecutive Agent (SEAD 4), National Security Adjudicative Guidelines  (AG) (December \n10, 2016) for all covered individuals who require initial or continued eligibility for access \nto classified information or eligibility to hold a sensitive position, effective June 8, 2017. \n\n \n2 \n                                      \n \nThe SOR alleged security concerns under Guidelines H (Drug Involvement and \nSubstance Misuse), and E (Personal Conduct), and detailed reasons why the DOD \nadjudicators were unable to find that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to \ngrant or continue a security clearance for Applicant. The SOR recommended referral to \nan administrative judge to determine whether a clearance should be granted, continued, \ndenied, or revoked.  \n \n \nIn a notarized statement, dated July 19, 2019, Applicant responded to the SOR \nand elected to have his case decided on the written record in lieu of a hearing. A complete \ncopy of the Government\u2019s file of relevant material (FORM) was mailed to Applicant by the \nDefense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) on August 16, 2019, and he was \nafforded an opportunity, within a period of 30 days, to file objections and submit material \nin refutation, extenuation, or mitigation. In addition to the FORM, Applicant was furnished \na copy of the Directive as well as the Adjudicative Guidelines applicable to his case. \nApplicant received the FORM on August 26, 2019. His response was due on September \n25, 2019. Applicant timely submitted one document in response to the FORM, and it was \nadmitted without objection. The case was assigned to me on September 16, 2019.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nIn his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted all of the factual allegations \npertaining to drug involvement and substance misuse (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a. through 1.f.); as well \nas all of the factual allegations pertaining to personal conduct (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.a. through 2.c.). \nApplicant\u2019s admissions and accompanying comments are incorporated herein as findings \nof fact. After a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, and upon due \nconsideration of same, I make the following additional findings of fact:  \n \nApplicant is a 27-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has been serving \nas an engineer/consultant with his current employer since June 2016. A 2011 high school \ngraduate, Applicant received a bachelor\u2019s degree in 2015. He has never served with the \nU.S. military. He was granted a secret clearance in 2016, and he is currently being \nsponsored for a top secret clearance. Applicant has never been married, and he has no \nchildren.  \n \nDrug Involvement and Substance Misuse \n \n \nApplicant was a recreational substance abuser whose primary substance of choice \nwas marijuana, but he also used cocaine, and a prescribed anxiety medication (the \nprescription was for someone other than himself). In addition, although not alleged in the \nSOR, Applicant also used mushrooms and an unspecified prescription painkiller. He \ncommenced what he called \u201csemi-regular use\u201d of marijuana in July 2011, and he \ncontinued using it periodically (anywhere from once or twice a month to 10 to 15 times \nper month) with friends in the evenings after school or on weekends while consuming \nalcohol in a party setting, or simply hanging out with friends at their home. He generally \nsmoked marijuana from a bowl. Applicant\u2019s motivation for using marijuana was to be \nsocial and have fun, to relieve stress, and to relax himself, but he later realized that it \nreduced his motivation levels and affected his performance. He intentionally sought out \n\n3 \n                                      \n \nparties where marijuana was being used. When his friends did not have any marijuana \nfor him, Applicant purchased marijuana for his personal use every other month from about \nSeptember 2012 until about June 2015. Applicant contends that he reduced his use of \nmarijuana in December 2015, and he last used marijuana in April 2017. (Item 3, at 27-29; \nItem 5, at 6-9) During a portion of the period of Applicant\u2019s marijuana use, he held a secret \nclearance (December 2016 \u2013 April 2017). (Item 1; Answer to the SOR) \n \nIn March 2015, while at a college fraternity event, Applicant was offered some \ncocaine by a friend, and while in the friend\u2019s car, Applicant snorted the cocaine. Applicant \nacknowledged that he attended the event intentionally with the knowledge that he would \nexperiment with cocaine. In March 2017, before attending a concert with friends, \nApplicant and some friends were in his home consuming alcohol to the point of \nintoxication. In addition, Applicant and at least one of his friends used cocaine. Applicant \nhad not initially intended to use cocaine that evening, but because he had used drugs \nwith the same person previously, he knowingly and voluntarily participated in the conduct. \n(Item 3, at 28; Item 5, at 8) The most recent use of cocaine occurred while Applicant held \na security clearance. (Item 1; Answer to the SOR) \n \nIn December 2016, prior to taking a flight, because he was experiencing anxiety \nabout flying, Applicant knowingly and voluntarily took two pills of the prescription \nmedication Klonopin \u2013 used to treat seizures, panic disorder, and anxiety \u2013 that he \nreceived from his girlfriend. The prescription was not for Applicant. (Item 5 at 9) \nApplicant\u2019s use of Klonopin occurred while he held a security clearance. (Answer to the \nSOR) \n \nApplicant has never received counseling or treatment as a result of his illegal use \nof drugs or controlled substances. (Item 3, at 31) He acknowledged that his wrongful use \nof the above described substances occurred during a period of his life when he was \nessentially immature and reckless. He claims he eventually matured and stopped using \nany illegal substances after April 2017, and that he has avoided his former drug-using \nfriends. (Item 5; Answer to the SOR) \n \nPersonal Conduct \n \n \nOn June 23, 2016, when Applicant completed his first e-QIP, he responded to \ncertain questions pertaining to his illegal use of drugs or drug activity found in Section 23 \n\u2013 Illegal Use of Drugs or Drug Activity. The most significant questions, and the ones \nalleged in the SOR, were essentially as follows: In the last seven (7) years: \u201chave you \nillegally used any drugs or controlled substances?\u201d; \u201chave you been involved in the illegal \npurchase, manufacture, cultivation, trafficking, production, transfer, shipping, receiving, \nhandling or sale of any drug or controlled substance?\u201d; and \u201chave you intentionally \nengaged in the misuse of prescription drugs, regardless of whether or not the drugs were \nprescribed for you or someone else?\u201d Applicant answered \u201cno\u201d to each of the questions. \n(Item 4, at 25) He omitted and concealed his subsequently admitted use of marijuana and \ncocaine. He certified that his responses to those two questions were \u201ctrue, complete, and \ncorrect\u201d to the best of his knowledge and belief, but, because of his omission and \nconcealment, the responses to those questions were, in fact, false. As for the response \n \n\n \n4 \n                                      \n \nto the prescription-related question, since the e-QIP was completed in June 2016, and \nthe alleged misuse of the prescription did not occur until December 2016, the e-QIP \nresponse was not false, despite Applicant\u2019s erroneous admission.  \n \nTo his credit, when applying for a top secret clearance, Applicant completed his \nmost recent e-QIP in August 2017, and he acknowledged his past drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse. (Item 3, at 27-30) \n \nPolicies \n \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the Executive \nBranch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security emphasizing, \n\u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d (Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. \n518, 528 (1988)) As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to control \naccess to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual \nis sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information. The President has \nauthorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant an applicant eligibility for \naccess to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to do so.\u201d (Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \nIndustry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified.)      \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the guidelines in SEAD 4. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the guidelines list potentially disqualifying \nconditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility \nfor access to classified information. \n \nAn administrative judge need not view the guidelines as inflexible, ironclad rules \nof law. Instead, acknowledging the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. The entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known \nas the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a meaningful decision. \n \nIn the decision-making process, facts must be established by \u201csubstantial \nevidence.\u201d \u201cSubstantial evidence [is] such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might \naccept as adequate to support a conclusion in light of all contrary evidence in the record.\u201d  \n(ISCR Case No. 04-11463 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2006) (citing Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1)).  \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d  (See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994).) \n \n The Government initially has the burden of producing evidence to establish a \npotentially disqualifying condition under the Directive, and has the burden of establishing \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Once the Government has produced substantial \nevidence of a disqualifying condition, under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant has the \n\n \n5 \n                                      \n \nburden of persuasion to present evidence in refutation, explanation, extenuation or \nmitigation, sufficient to overcome the doubts raised by the Government\u2019s case. The \nburden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government. (See ISCR \nCase No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).) \n  \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours as well. It is \nbecause of this special relationship that the Government must be able to repose a high \ndegree of trust and confidence in those individuals to whom it grants access to classified \ninformation. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the \napplicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. Such \ndecisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather \nthan actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Furthermore, \u201csecurity clearance \ndeterminations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d (Egan, 484 U.S. at 531) \n \nClearance decisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense \nbe a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d (See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 \n7)  Thus, nothing in this decision should be construed to suggest that I have based this \ndecision, in whole or in part, on any express or implied determination as to Applicant\u2019s \nallegiance, loyalty, or patriotism. It is merely an indication the Applicant has or has not \nmet the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for \nissuing a clearance.  In reaching this decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that \nare reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I \nhave avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nAnalysis \n \n \nGuideline H, Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Drug Involvement and Substance \nAbuse is set out in AG \u00b6 24:       \n \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual's reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior may \nlead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. Controlled substance means any \"controlled substance\" as \ndefined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term adopted in \nthis guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above. \n \nFurthermore, on October 25, 2014, the Director of National Intelligence (DNI) \nissued Memorandum ES 2014-00674, Adherence to Federal Laws Prohibiting Marijuana \nUse, which states: \n\n \n6 \n                                      \n \n \n[C]hanges to state laws and the laws of the District of Columbia pertaining \nto marijuana use do not alter the existing National Security Adjudicative \nGuidelines (Reference H and I). An individual's disregard of federal law \npertaining to the use, sale, or manufacture of marijuana remains \nadjudicatively relevant in national security determinations. As always, \nadjudicative authorities are expected to evaluate claimed or developed use \nof, or involvement with, marijuana using the current adjudicative criteria. \nThe adjudicative authority must determine if the use of, or involvement with, \nmarijuana raises questions about the individual's judgment, reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and willingness to comply with law, rules, and regulations, \nincluding federal laws, when making eligibility decisions of persons \nproposed for, or occupying, sensitive national security positions. \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions under AG \u00b6 25 that could raise security \nconcerns in this case:  \n \n(a) any substance misuse (see above definition); \n \n(c) illegal possession of a controlled substance, including cultivation, \nprocessing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of \ndrug paraphernalia; and \n \n(f) any illegal drug use while granted access to classified information or \nholding a sensitive position.  \n \nApplicant admittedly was a \u201csemi-regular\u201d marijuana user between July 2011 and \nApril 2017; a two-time user of cocaine in March 2015 and March 2017; and a one-time \nuser of a prescription medication that was not prescribed for him in December 2016. \nDuring the period September 2012 and June 2015, he purchased marijuana on numerous \noccasions every other month. He held a security clearance from December 2016 until the \npresent day. AG \u00b6\u00b6 25(a), 25(c), and 25(f) have been established. \n \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions under AG \u00b6 26 that could \nmitigate security concerns arising from Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse:  \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; and \n \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and substance \nmisuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and \nhas established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not limited to: (1) \ndisassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; (2) changing or \navoiding the environment where drugs were used; and (3) providing a \nsigned statement of intent to abstain from all drug involvement and \n\n \n7 \n                                      \n \nsubstance misuse, acknowledging that any future involvement or misuse is \ngrounds for revocation of national security eligibility. \n \nAG \u00b6 26(a) and 26(b) minimally apply. Applicant\u2019s \u201csemi-regular\u201d use of marijuana \noccurred from July 2011 until April 2017, and as such, there was nothing infrequent about \nhis marijuana use, and there is no evidence to indicate that it happened under such \ncircumstances that it was unlikely to recur. His two incidents of cocaine use took place in \n2015 and 2017. The one misuse of the prescription medication took place in December \n2016. It is highly significant that the use or misuse of the three substances either occurred \nor continued occurring after Applicant was granted a security clearance in December \n2016. While Applicant now finely acknowledges his drug involvement and substance \nmisuse, he has only stated that he is abstinent and that he has ended his relationships \nwith his drug-using friends. There is no documentation, including character statements \nthat might support his positions. Also, although he claims to have no intention of future \ndrug involvement and substance misuse, he has not submitted a formal statement \nacknowledging that any future involvement or misuse is grounds for revocation of national \nsecurity eligibility. \n \nA person should not be held forever accountable for misconduct from the past, but \nin this instance, the most recent drug involvement and substance misuse, was in April \n2017, while Applicant was in possession of a security clearance.  Given his cavalier \nattitude towards laws, rules, and regulations, Applicant\u2019s use of marijuana, cocaine, and \na prescription medication that was not prescribed for him while holding a security \nclearance, despite knowing that such use was prohibited by both the Government and his \nemployer, continues to cast doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, and good \njudgment. \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Personal Conduct is set out in \nAG \u00b6 15: \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. The following will normally result in \nan unfavorable national security eligibility determination, security clearance \naction, or cancellation of further processing for national security eligibility: \n \n(a) refusal, or failure without reasonable cause, to undergo or cooperate \nwith security processing, including but not limited to meeting with a security \ninvestigator for subject interview, completing security forms or releases, \ncooperation with medical or psychological evaluation, or polygraph \nexamination, if authorized and required; and \n \n\n \n8 \n                                      \n \n(b) refusal to provide full, frank, and truthful answers to lawful questions of \ninvestigators, security officials, or other official representatives in \nconnection with a personnel security or trustworthiness determination. \n \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could raise security \nconcerns under AG \u00b6 16: \n \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar \nform used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, \naward benefits or status, determine national security eligibility or \ntrustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities; and \n \n(c) credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is \nnot sufficient for an adverse determination under any other single guideline, \nbut which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-person \nassessment of questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack \nof candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations, or other \ncharacteristics indicating that the individual may not properly safeguard \nclassified or sensitive information. \n \nMy discussions related to Applicant\u2019s drug involvement and substance misuse are \nadopted herein. At the time Applicant completed his initial e-QIP in June 2016, he \nconcealed any references to his history of drug involvement and substance misuse. \nApplicant\u2019s comments provide sufficient evidence to examine if his submissions were \ndeliberate falsifications, as alleged in the SOR, or merely inaccurate answers that were \nthe result of oversight or misunderstanding of the true facts on his part. Proof of incorrect \nanswers, standing alone, does not establish or prove an applicant\u2019s intent or state of mind \nwhen the falsification or omission occurred. As an administrative judge, I must consider \nthe record evidence as a whole to determine whether there is direct or circumstantial \nevidence concerning Applicant\u2019s intent or state of mind at the time the alleged \nfalsifications or omissions occurred.  \n \nI have considered the entire record, including Applicant\u2019s admission of the SOR \nallegations. As noted above, Applicant did not controvert the falsification allegations. In \nhis Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted failing to disclose his illegal drug use in his \n2016 e-QIP. He explained that he was worried that any potential red flags would put his \njob offer in jeopardy, so he \u201cmade the mistake of not completely disclosing his history of \ncontrolled substances during the time frame in question.\u201d In stating the above, Applicant \nwas still not fully candid, for it was not his failure to completely disclose his history of drug \nuse, but his absolute and complete denial that he had such a history. He did not claim \nthat he misinterpreted the questions, or that he forgot his drug involvement and substance \nmisuse. In other words, he intentionally concealed his substance misuse and falsified his \nresponses. As to the deliberate falsifications on the 2016 e-QIP regarding his drug \nactivity, pertaining to SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.a. and 2.b., AG \u00b6 16(a) has been established. For the \nreasons stated above, AG \u00b6 16(a), pertaining to SOR \u00b6 2.c., has not been established. \nBecause of the way the SOR was drafted, the drug involvement and substance misuse \n\n \n9 \n                                      \n \nwere not separately alleged under personal conduct, and AG \u00b6 16(c) has not been \nestablished. \n \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions under AG \u00b6 17 that could \nmitigate security concerns arising from personal conduct. They include: \n \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; and \n \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment. \n \nNeither of the conditions apply. Applicant\u2019s false responses to the e-QIP inquiry \noccurred in June 2016. It took over an additional year, but Applicant finally acknowledged \nhis history of drug involvement and substance misuse when he completed his August \n2017 e-QIP. However, before those e-QIP admissions, he made no efforts to correct the \nomissions, concealments, or falsifications associated with his 2016 e-QIP. Applicant\u2019s \nattitude towards laws, rules, and regulations while initially seeking, and subsequently \nholding, a security clearance, lasted over a year. Despite his claimed new maturity, \nApplicant\u2019s actions under the circumstances continue to cast doubt on his current \nreliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6 2(d): \n  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nUnder SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. Moreover, I have \nevaluated the various aspects of this case in light of the totality of the record evidence \nand have not merely performed a piecemeal analysis. (See U.S. v. Bottone, 365 F.2d \n389, 392 (2d Cir. 1966); See also ISCR Case No. 03-22861 at 2-3 (App. Bd. Jun. 2, 2006))  \n  \n\n \n10 \n                                      \n \nThere is some evidence mitigating Applicant\u2019s conduct. Applicant is a 27-year-old \nemployee of a defense contractor. He has been serving as an engineer/consultant with \nhis current employer since June 2016. A 2011 high school graduate, Applicant received \na bachelor\u2019s degree in 2015. He was granted a security clearance in December 2016. He \nhas reportedly abstained from any drug involvement and substance misuse since April \n2017. Applicant finally disclosed his history of drug involvement and substance misuse \nwhen he completed his most recent e-QIP in August 2017, when he was being sponsored \nby his employer for a top secret clearance. \n \nThe disqualifying evidence under the whole-person concept is more substantial. \nApplicant admittedly was a \u201csemi-regular\u201d marijuana user between July 2011 and April \n2017; a two-time user of cocaine in March 2015 and March 2017; and a one-time user of \na prescription medication that was not prescribed for him in December 2016. During the \nperiod September 2012 and June 2015, he purchased marijuana on numerous occasions \nevery other month. He held a security clearance from December 2016 until the present \nday. Applicant admitted failing to disclose his illegal drug use in his 2016 e-QIP. He \nexplained that he was worried that any potential red flags would put his job offer in \njeopardy, so he intentionally concealed his substance misuse and falsified his responses. \nApplicant finally acknowledged his history of drug involvement and substance misuse \nwhen he completed his August 2017 e-QIP, but before those e-QIP admissions, he made \nno efforts to correct the omissions, concealments, or falsifications associated with his \n2016 e-QIP. Applicant\u2019s attitude towards laws, rules, and regulations, is unacceptable, \nespecially for one who was an applicant for a security clearance, and was still using illegal \nsubstances when he completed the first e-QIP, and then was granted a security \nclearance. \n \nOverall, the evidence leaves me with substantial questions and doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all of these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant has failed to mitigate the security concerns arising from his drug \ninvolvement and substance abuse; and personal conduct. See SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6\u00b6 2(d)(1) \nthrough AG 2(d)(9). \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline H:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a. through 1.f.:  \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 2.a. and 2.b.: \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.c.:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \n\n \n11 \n                                      \n \nConclusion \n \n \n In light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n \n \n                                    \n         \n \n \n__________________________ \nROBERT ROBINSON GALES \nAdministrative Judge \n",

The DOD CAF acted under Executive Order \n(EO) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as \namended; DOD 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review \nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines \neffective June 8, 2017 (AG). \n \nApplicant answered the SOR on June 11, 2019, and elected to have her case \ndecided on the written record in lieu of a hearing. Department Counsel submitted the \nGovernment\u2019s File of Relevant Material (FORM) on August 22, 2019. The evidence \n\n \n2 \n \n \nincluded in the FORM is identified as Items 4-7 (Items 1-3 include pleadings and \ntransmittal information). The FORM was mailed to Applicant, who received it on August \n27, 2019. Applicant was given an opportunity to file objections and submit material in \nrefutation, extenuation, or mitigation. She did not submit any evidence or file objections \nto the Government\u2019s evidence. Items 4-7 are admitted into evidence without objections. \nThe case was assigned to me on November 6, 2019.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant admitted all of the SOR allegations, with explanations (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-\n1.o). The admissions are adopted as findings of fact. After a careful review of the \npleadings and evidence, I make the following additional findings of fact. \n \n \nApplicant is 44 years old. She has worked for a government contractor since July \n2005. From 2007 to 2013 she also worked part-time in sales for a retail business. She \nreceived her bachelor\u2019s degree in 1998. She is single, has never married, and has no \nchildren. (Items 4-5) \n \n \n \nThe SOR alleged 15 delinquent debts totaling approximately $25,000. The debts \nare comprised of charged-off and collections accounts (credit cards and consumer \ndebts). The debts are supported by credit reports from December 2016 and March \n2019, her statement to an investigator in April 2018, and her SOR admissions in her \nanswer. (Items 3-7) \n \n \nApplicant attributes her financial problems to losing her part-time job in 2013 and \nthe loss of her fianc\u00e9, with whom she shared expenses and financial obligations. No \nfurther information is contained in the record concerning her fianc\u00e9e. Applicant \ndocumented that she entered into a debt relief plan (DRP) in April 2018. Under the \nterms of the DRP, all the SOR debts were included in the plan. Applicant was to pay \n$378 monthly (through bi-weekly bank withdrawals) for 48 months beginning in May \n2018. Applicant failed to produce documentation that any payments were made to the \nDRP or that the DRP made any payments to the listed creditors. Applicant included two \nemails from the debt relief company to Applicant (dated June 6, 2018, and May 29, \n2019), which both listed payment schedules, but neither documented any previous \npayments made. She did not provide any information about her current financial \ncircumstances. Aside from entering into the DRP, Applicant provided no evidence of \nfinancial counseling. She presented no evidence of taking other action to pay or \notherwise resolve the SOR debts. Applicant\u2019s debts remain unresolved. (Items 2 (See \nDRP attached to Applicant\u2019s answer), Item 5). \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \n\n \n3 \n \n \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(a), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record.  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.\u201d  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk that an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information).  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n4 \n \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nAG & 18 expresses the security concern for financial considerations:  \n \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. I have \nconsidered all of them under AG & 19 and the following potentially apply: \n \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \n \nApplicant\u2019s delinquent debts remain unpaid or unresolved. I find the above \ndisqualifying conditions are raised.  \n \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns \narising from financial difficulties. I have considered all of the mitigating conditions under \nAG \u00b6 20 and the following potentially apply: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n\n \n5 \n \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control; and \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s debts are recent and remain unresolved. She did not provide \nsufficient evidence to show that her financial problems are unlikely to recur. AG \u00b6 20(a) \ndoes not apply. Applicant presented some evidence that the debts were due to \ncircumstances beyond her control (losing her part-time position and the loss of her \nfianc\u00e9). She began taking responsible action by entering into the DRP, but she failed to \nestablish that she followed through on her efforts by showing actual proof of payments \nto the DRP and the resulting diminution of her SOR debts. She did not show that she \ntook responsible action to resolve her debts. I find AG \u00b6 20(b) does not fully apply. \nApplicant\u2019s only efforts to resolve her debts was to enter into the DRP in May 2018. She \ndocumented no further action by her since then. She failed to provide documentation \nshowing any efforts to make payments on the listed debts. There is no evidence she \nobtained financial counseling. AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(c) and 20(d) do not fully apply.  \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guideline and the whole-person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I considered Applicant\u2019s loss of her \npart-time position and the loss of her fianc\u00e9. However, she also failed to present \ndocumentation showing payments under the DRP and therefore addressing her debt. \nApplicant has not established a track record of financial stability.  \n\n \n6 \n \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant failed to mitigate the security concerns arising under Guideline F, \nfinancial considerations. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a\u20131.o: \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact In his SOR answer, Applicant admitted five of the financial allegations (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.e). He denied the last allegation - SOR \u00b6 1.f. He also submitted comments in mitigation and explanation. His admissions are incorporated herein as findings of fact. After a thorough review of the record evidence, I make the following additional findings of fact: Applicant is 44 years old. He graduated from high school in 1993. Shortly thereafter, he enlisted in the U.S. Air Force where he honorably served until he retired in 2013. He possessed a security clearance during most of his service. Applicant has been in a close relationship with a woman (he called the relationship a civil marriage) since 2000. He has no children. Following his retirement, Applicant worked as a truck driver for companies or as an independent contractor. He was unemployed during two periods: the first, between May and September 2017, and the second, between February and May 2018. Applicant\u2019s sponsor, a federal contractor, hired him in May 2018. He has worked for his employer since May 2018. In response to Section 26 (Financial Record) of his May 2018 SCA, Applicant disclosed that he had financial problems and revealed most of the SOR accounts.

When the larger truck broke, he did not have the money to pay for the repairs, and it was repossessed. Ultima",

Nagel, Esq., Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro se \n \n12/17/2019 \n \nDecision \n \nRIVERA, Juan J., Administrative Judge: \n \nApplicant\u2019s financial problems resulted from circumstances beyond his control. \nHe disclosed his financial problems in his security clearance application and started the \nprocess to resolve his delinquent accounts before he received the Statement of \nReasons (SOR). He has some work to do to completely resolve his financial problems, \nbut he has acted responsibly under his circumstances. He mitigated the financial \nconsiderations security concerns. Clearance is granted. \nStatement of the Case \nApplicant submitted a security clearance application (SCA) on May 23, 2018. He \nwas interviewed by a government investigator on October 3, 2018. After reviewing the \ninformation gathered during the background investigation, the Department of Defense \n(DOD) issued an SOR on May 9, 2019, alleging security concerns under Guideline F \n(financial considerations). Applicant answered the SOR on June 12, 2019, and \nrequested a decision based on the written record in lieu of a hearing. \nA copy of the Government\u2019s file of relevant material (FORM), containing the \nevidence supporting the security concerns, was provided to Applicant by letter dated \nAugust 15, 2019. Applicant received the FORM on August 20, 2019. He was granted a \n\n \n2 \n \n \nperiod of 30 days after receipt of the FORM to submit any objections to the FORM and \nto provide material to refute, extenuate, or mitigate the concerns. Applicant responded \nto the FORM on September 10, 2019. He submitted a one-page statement, documents \naddressing a delinquent account, and documents showing he retained the services of a \nnational debt relief (NDR) company to resolve his financial problems (eight pages total). \nHe raised no objections to the Government\u2019s proffered evidence. The case was \nassigned to me on October 22, 2019. Without objections, I admitted and considered the \nGovernment\u2019s and Applicant\u2019s proposed evidence.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nIn his SOR answer, Applicant admitted five of the financial allegations (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 \n1.a through 1.e). He denied the last allegation - SOR \u00b6 1.f. He also submitted comments \nin mitigation and explanation. His admissions are incorporated herein as findings of fact. \nAfter a thorough review of the record evidence, I make the following additional findings \nof fact:  \n \nApplicant is 44 years old. He graduated from high school in 1993. Shortly \nthereafter, he enlisted in the U.S. Air Force where he honorably served until he retired in \n2013. He possessed a security clearance during most of his service. Applicant has been \nin a close relationship with a woman (he called the relationship a civil marriage) since \n2000. He has no children.  \n \nFollowing his retirement, Applicant worked as a truck driver for companies or as \nan independent contractor. He was unemployed during two periods: the first, between \nMay and September 2017, and the second, between February and May 2018. \nApplicant\u2019s sponsor, a federal contractor, hired him in May 2018. He has worked for his \nemployer since May 2018.  \n \nIn response to Section 26 (Financial Record) of his May 2018 SCA, Applicant \ndisclosed that he had financial problems and revealed most of the SOR accounts. \nApplicant \nexplained \nthat \nhis \nfinancial \nproblems \nresulted \nfrom \na \nfailed \ncargo/transportation business. He purchased two trucks for his business. When the \nlarger truck broke, he did not have the money to pay for the repairs, and it was \nrepossessed. Ultimately, his business failed. When his business collapsed in 2017, \nApplicant had difficulty finding employment and his income was insufficient to pay for his \nliving expenses and accumulated debts. \n \nIn May 2018, Applicant sought help and hired the services of an NDR to resolve \nhis delinquent accounts. He included all six SOR accounts on his NDR resolution plan. \nHe told the investigator that he had two other delinquent credit cards that he was \nrepaying outside of the NDR program. Applicant promised to pay all of his delinquent \naccounts. \n \nAlthough Applicant contacted NDR in May 2018, his participation in the debt \nresolution plan did not start until February 2019. He stated that because of his periods \n\n \n3 \n \n \nof unemployment, he did not have the money to start making payments into the plan \nearlier. Applicant\u2019s documentary evidence shows that between February and August \n2019 he made six payments for a total of $5,200. The documents further show that \nNDR resolved one of the accounts and its payment is pending. I find Applicant has \nestablished a good-faith effort to resolve five of his delinquent debts (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a \nthrough 1.e).  \n \nConcerning SOR \u00b6 1.f, Applicant\u2019s evidence show that the creditor cancelled the \ndebt in October 2018, and issued him an IRS Form 1099-C (showing the debt \ncancellation). Applicant stated that he declared the debt cancellation as income when \nhe filed his tax returns.  \n \nIn his answer to the FORM, Applicant disclosed another delinquent account that \nwas not alleged in the SOR. He submitted documentary evidence showing that he \ncontacted the creditor, settled the account, and started making $50 payments on his \ndebt payment plan. \n \nApplicant\u2019s credit reports show that he appears to be living within his financial \nmeans, and has acquired no new debt or additional delinquent accounts. Apparently, \nApplicant\u2019s current job allows him to meet his financial obligations and living expenses. \n \nPolicies \n \nThe SOR was issued under Executive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information Within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (Directive) \n(January 2, 1992), as amended; and the National Security Adjudicative Guidelines for \nDetermining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information or Eligibility to Hold a \nSensitive Position (AGs), applicable to all adjudicative decisions issued on or after June \n8, 2017.  \n \nEligibility for access to classified information may be granted \u201conly upon a finding \nthat it is clearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended. \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the Executive \nBranch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security, emphasizing \nthat \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 \nU.S. 518, 528 (1988). \n \nThe AGs list disqualifying and mitigating conditions for evaluating a person\u2019s \nsuitability for access to classified information. Any one disqualifying or mitigating \ncondition is not, by itself, conclusive. However, the AGs should be followed where a \ncase can be measured against them, as they represent policy guidance governing \naccess to classified information. Each decision must reflect a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense consideration of the whole person and the factors listed in SEAD 4, App. \n\n \n4 \n \n \nA \u00b6\u00b6 2(d) and 2(f). All available, reliable information about the person, past and present, \nfavorable and unfavorable, must be considered.  \n \nSecurity clearance decisions resolve whether it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant or continue an applicant\u2019s security clearance. The Government \nmust prove, by substantial evidence, controverted facts alleged in the SOR. If it does, \nthe burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts. The \napplicant bears the heavy burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant or continue his or her security clearance.  \n \nPersons with access to classified information enter into a fiduciary relationship \nwith the Government based on trust and confidence. Thus, the Government has a \ncompelling interest in ensuring each applicant possesses the requisite judgment, \nreliability, and trustworthiness of those who must protect national interest as their own. \nThe \u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d standard compels resolution of any \nreasonable doubt about an applicant\u2019s suitability for access in favor of the Government. \n\u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d \nEgan, 484 U.S. at 531; SEAD 4, \u00b6 E(4); SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6\u00b6 1(d) and 2(b). Clearance \ndecisions are not a determination of the loyalty of the applicant concerned. They are \nmerely an indication that the applicant has or has not met the strict guidelines the \nGovernment has established for issuing a clearance. \n \nAnalysis \n \nFinancial Considerations \n \nAG \u00b6 18 articulates the security concern relating to financial problems:  \n \nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds . . . .  \n \nApplicant\u2019s financial problems are documented in the record. After he retired from \nthe service, he established a transportation business that failed in 2017, and he had two \nperiods of unemployment. Because of his reduced earnings he had six accounts that \nbecame delinquent and were charged off. AG \u00b6 19 provides disqualifying conditions that \ncould raise a security concern and may be disqualifying in this case: \u201c(a) inability to \nsatisfy debts;\u201d and \u201c(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations.\u201d The record \n\n \n5 \n \n \nestablished these disqualifying conditions, requiring additional inquiry about the possible \napplicability of mitigating conditions.  \n \nThe following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially applicable: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control; and \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \n \n \nAll of the above financial considerations mitigating conditions are partially or fully \nraised by the facts in this case and mitigate the security concerns. Applicant developed \nfinancial problems because of his failed business and periods of unemployment. His \nfinancial problems could be attributed to circumstances beyond his control. \n \n \nIn May 2018, Applicant started the process of retaining a debt resolution \ncompany to help him resolve his charged-off accounts. Because of his reduced income, \nhe was not able to start contributing into the debt resolution program until February \n2019. Between February and August 2019 he made six payments to the debt resolution \nprogram for a total of $5,200. The company resolved one of accounts and payment is \npending. I find Applicant has established a good-faith effort to resolve five of his \ndelinquent debts. The sixth debt was cancelled by the creditor. \n \n \nApplicant maintained his financial responsibility and has acquired no additional \ndelinquencies. Although Applicant could have been more diligent addressing his \ncharged-off accounts, I find that he has been financially responsible under his \ncircumstances. Applicant\u2019s evidence is sufficient to demonstrate his current financial \nresponsibility, and that his financial problems are being resolved. The financial \nconsiderations security concerns are mitigated.  \n \n\n \n6 \n \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case, and under the whole-person \nconcept. Security Executive Agent Directive (SEAD) 4, App. A, \u00b6\u00b6 2(a) and 2(d). I have \nincorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. Some of \nthese factors were addressed under that guideline, but some warrant additional \ncomment. \n \nApplicant, 44, served on active duty and was honorably retired. He held a \nclearance while in the service. There is no evidence of any security concerns, except for \nthose in the SOR. He has been employed with a federal contractor since May 2018.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s evidence is sufficient to establish that circumstances beyond his \ncontrol contributed to or aggravated his financial problems. After that, he has been \nfinancially responsible addressing his delinquent account within his financial means. He \nhas established a viable plan to resolve the accounts alleged in the SOR and he is in \ncontrol of his finances.   \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:          \n \n  \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:   \n \n \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n  \nSubparagraphs 1.a - 1.f: \n \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly \nconsistent with the national security interests of the United States to grant Applicant\u2019s \neligibility for a security clearance. Clearance is granted. \n \n \n \n____________________________ \nJUAN J. RIVERA \nAdministrative Judge \n",

Access to classified information is granted.   \nStatement of the Case \n \n \nOn May 2, 2018, Applicant completed and signed a Questionnaire for National \nSecurity Positions (SF 86) or security clearance application (SCA). (Government Exhibit \n(GE) 1) On June 14, 2019, the Department of Defense (DOD) Consolidated Adjudications \nFacility (CAF) issued a SOR to Applicant under Executive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry, February 20, 1960; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (Directive), \nJanuary 2, 1992; and Security Executive Agent Directive 4, establishing in Appendix A \nthe National Security Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to \nClassified Information or Eligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position (AGs), effective June 8, \n2017. (Hearing Exhibit (HE) 2)  \nThe SOR detailed reasons why the DOD CAF did not find under the Directive that \nit is clearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant or continue a security \nclearance for Applicant and recommended referral to an administrative judge to \ndetermine whether a clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked. \nSpecifically, the SOR set forth security concerns arising under Guidelines J, E, and D.  \n\n \n2 \n                                         \n \nOn July 8, 2019, Applicant responded to the SOR and requested a hearing. (HE \n3) On August 22, 2019, Department Counsel was ready to proceed. On September 9, \n2019, the case was assigned to me. On September 16, 2019, the Defense Office of \nHearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a notice of hearing, setting the hearing for October \n10, 2019. (HE 1)     \n  \nDuring the hearing, Department Counsel offered five exhibits, and Applicant \noffered six exhibits. (Transcript (Tr.) 11-12, 19-20; GE 1-5; Applicant Exhibit (AE) A-AE \nF) There were no objections to GE 1 and all of Applicant\u2019s exhibits, and those seven \nexhibits were admitted into evidence. (Tr. 19, 21; GE 1; AE A-AE F) On October 21, 2019, \nDOHA received a transcript of the hearing.  \n \nProcedural Issues \n \nApplicant objected to the admissibility of Applicant\u2019s responses to DOHA \ninterrogatories and Applicant\u2019s Office of Personnel Management (OPM) personal subject \ninterview (PSI) because they were unfairly prejudicial; Applicant was without counsel; and \nApplicant may not have understood the significance of his answers. (Tr. 12-14) Applicant \ndid not testify on the suppression motion. Applicant also objected to the admissibility of a \ncivilian police report and a Naval Criminal Investigative Service (NCIS) report of \ninvestigation (ROI), which is a brief summary of a civilian police report of an allegation of \nrape and infliction of injury because they are hearsay; he was unable to confront and \ncross-examine the witnesses who were the sources of the allegations; and the reports \nlacked an authenticating witness. (Tr. 15-19) He did not dispute the accuracy of the \ninformation in the documents.   \n \nA civilian police report, GE 4, was admitted over Applicant\u2019s objection. (Tr. 19, 50-\n51) Applicant withdrew his objection to an NCIS report, GE 5, and it was admitted into \nevidence. (Tr. 19; 50-51) The DOHA Appeal Board has \u201cpreviously held that an Army \nCriminal Investigation Division [ROI] constituted an official record within the meaning of \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.20. ISCR Case No. 06-06496 at 2-3 (App. Bd. June 25, 2009). Unlike a \nDOD personnel background ROI, the CID report was admissible without an authenticating \nwitness.\u201d ISCR Case No. 08-08085 at 4 n.3 (App. Bd. Apr. 21, 2010). Applicant\u2019s \nresponses to DOHA interrogatories are also admissible. See ISCR Case No. 11-13999 \nat 6-7 (App. Bd. Feb. 3, 2014) (stating responses to DOHA interrogatories are admissible \nas an admission of a party opponent).  \n \nApplicant adopted the summary of his OPM interview at his hearing, and I admitted \nit into evidence over Applicant\u2019s objection. (GE 3) Applicant\u2019s response to DOHA \ninterrogatories was not admitted because the content was cumulative and of limited \nrelevance. (Tr. 77) \n \nSome details were excluded to protect Applicant\u2019s right to privacy. Specific \ninformation is available in the cited exhibits. \n \n \n \n\n \n3 \n                                         \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn Applicant\u2019s SOR response, he denied all of the SOR allegations. (HE 3) He also \nprovided extenuating and mitigating information. (HE 3)  \n \nApplicant is a 31-year-old manufacturing engineer employed by a defense \ncontractor. (Tr. 28) He was married from July 2010 to December 2012. (GE 1) His children \nare ages two, four, and five. (Tr. 27) In 2017, he received a bachelor\u2019s degree. (GE 1) He \nis currently seeking a master\u2019s degree in business administration. (Tr. 28)  \n \nApplicant served in the Navy as a combat medic from 2006 to 2010. (Tr. 31) He \nserved in two combat tours, lost a close friend in combat, and eventually received a 100 \npercent service-connected disability rating for post-traumatic stress disorder and \ntraumatic brain injury. (Tr. 33; AE D) Applicant dragged a friend to safety on the battlefield, \nand he received a Bronze Star with \u201cV\u201d Device. (Tr. 78) He also received a Purple Heart, \nNavy and Marine Corps Achievement Medal, Combat Action Ribbon, Iraq Campaign \nMedal, Global War on Terrorism Service Medal, Global War on Terrorism Expeditionary \nMedal, National Defense Service Medal, Sea Service Deployment Ribbon, and various \nmedals for his expertise with weapons. (AE C) \n \nCriminal Conduct and Sexual Behavior \n \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 3.a allege Applicant was arrested in March 2010 and charged with \nRape of a Spouse and Willful Infliction of Corporal Injury. The NCIS ROI indicates that \ncivilian law enforcement cited these offenses; however, it also indicates the accuser (A) \nwas \u201cgirlfriend\u201d and not his spouse. (GE 5) Applicant indicated A was not his spouse.  \n \nIn July 2010, A called the civilian police and said that in March 2010, on two \noccasions Applicant sexually assaulted her, and on the second occasion, he threatened \nto kill her. (GE 5) The police briefed the district attorney about A\u2019s allegations, and the \ndistrict attorney declined to prosecute \u201cdue to lack of evidence.\u201d (GE 5) The civilian police \ninformed the NCIS of the allegation, and its disposition, and the NCIS generated a \nsummary ROI. The NCIS ROI does not indicate Applicant was ever arrested, formally \ninterviewed, or charged. Applicant was assigned to a Marine Corps Base outside of the \nstate where the offense allegedly occurred. The NCIS ROI indicates Applicant\u2019s \ncommand declined to take legal or administrative action against Applicant, and the ROI \n\u201cis not to be attached to or used as an exhibit in an adverse employment or administrative \nproceeding.\u201d (GE 5) \n \nApplicant learned the police were investigating A\u2019s allegation when a police officer \ncalled him on the phone, and he orally explained his relationship with A to the police \nofficer. (Tr. 41, 44) Applicant provided to the police names of witnesses who could \ndescribe his relationship with A. (Tr. 41, 44) He was never advised of his constitutional \nrights, and he was never asked to render a written statement. (Tr. 76) Several months \nlater an investigator called Applicant and told him no adverse action would be taken \nagainst him. (Tr. 41) He was never questioned by his command or the NCIS about the \nincidents involving A. (Tr. 45) The Government did not produce any evidence that \n\n \n4 \n                                         \n \nApplicant was charged for the conduct in 2010, and Applicant said he was unaware of \nany charges filed against him. (Tr. 48; GE 5) \n \nApplicant denied that he sexually assaulted A. (Tr. 37-47; HE 3) He engaged in \nsexual activity with her on multiple occasions, and he always stopped sexual activity when \nshe asked him to do so. (HE 3) He described her as crazy, unstable, suicidal (attempted \nsuicide by cutting her wrists), and argumentative about the circumstances of daily living. \n(Tr. 37-40) She threatened to call the police and make a false allegation against him. (Tr. \n39) She destroyed his property and physically attacked him several times. (Tr. 39-40, 58) \nAfter Applicant left A, she called him on the telephone and asked him how he would feel \nif she accused him of rape, and he said he would be unhappy. (Tr. 45-46) She laughed \nand hung up the phone. (Tr. 46)   \n \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b and 1.c allege Applicant was arrested in February 2015 and December \n2017 and charged with Domestic Assault. The second alleged offense occurred in July \n2016, and the charge was dismissed in December 2017. (GE 4) Applicant resided with \nhis cohabitant (C), the alleged victim of the Domestic Assault, from 2013 to July 2019, \nexcept for a period of separation after the alleged assault in February 2015. (Tr. 28, 34) \nApplicant and C currently reside on opposite sides of the country. (Tr. 35) \n \nIn February 2015, Applicant and C were arguing in their residence. (Tr. 52) It was \nValentine\u2019s Day, and C was complaining about Applicant insisting on studying for a test. \n(Tr. 52-53) He ignored C, and she became upset and started hitting him. (Tr. 52-53) \nApplicant wanted to leave the residence and stay with a friend, and C was holding him to \nkeep him from leaving. (Tr. 54) Applicant and C were pushing each other, and Applicant \nleft the residence. (Tr. 55; GE 3) C\u2019s mother called the police. (Tr. 55) Later Applicant \nreturned to his residence and went to bed. (Tr. 55) The police talked to Applicant about \nthe incident the next day, and the police left without arresting Applicant. (Tr. 55) The police \nadvised his cohabitant to get an order of protection, and she obtained one. (Tr. 56-57) \nAfter the incident, and living apart for several months, Applicant and C resumed their \ncohabitant relationship. (Tr. 60-61) C was the victim of domestic violence from a previous \nrelationship with someone other than Applicant. (Tr. 58) In March 2016, Applicant \nappeared in court. (Tr. 55; GE 4) The charge was dismissed without Applicant being \narraigned or entering a plea. (Tr. 60, 63-64)  \n \nIn July 2016, C\u2019s son was taking a bath, and he started yelling and crying because \nhe had soap in his eyes. (Tr. 67; GE 4) C was in the bathroom helping her son. Applicant \nstuck his head in the bathroom, and C pushed the bathroom door, which struck \nApplicant\u2019s head and caused a cut. (Tr. 68) Applicant\u2019s head bled profusely, and Applicant \ncalled 911 because he wanted an ambulance to take him to the hospital. (Tr. 68) Applicant \nwas worried about his previous service-connected traumatic brain injury. (Tr. 68) \nApplicant decided to drive himself to the hospital for treatment. (Tr. 68) While he was at \nthe hospital, the police came to his house. Applicant believed that C was worried about \nlosing custody for assaulting Applicant, and she accused Applicant of assaulting her. (Tr. \n69) She subsequently admitted to Applicant that she lied to the police because she was \nworried about losing custody of her son to her previous boyfriend. (Tr. 75-76) When he \n\n \n5 \n                                         \n \nwent to court, he received a continuance, and after leaving court he learned the charge \nwas dismissed. (Tr. 71-73) \n   \nPersonal Conduct \n \nSOR \u00b6 2.a cross-alleges the criminal conduct in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.c.  \n \nSOR \u00b6 2.b alleges Applicant failed to disclose that he was charged with the felonies \nof rape and infliction of injury on his May 2, 2018 SCA. Applicant did not disclose that he \nwas charged with rape and infliction of injury on his May 2, 2018 SCA; however, there is \nno evidence Applicant was charged with rape and infliction of injury. There is no evidence \nApplicant failed to disclose required information on his SCA.  \n \nPolicies \n \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the Executive \nBranch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security emphasizing, \n\u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. \n518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to control \naccess to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual \nis sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The President \nhas authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicant\u2019s eligibility for \naccess to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865. \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable.  \n \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nabout potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Clearance \ndecisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a \ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 7. \nThus, nothing in this decision should be construed to suggest that it is based, in whole or \nin part, on any express or implied determination about applicant\u2019s allegiance, loyalty, or \npatriotism. It is merely an indication the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the \nPresident, Secretary of Defense, and DNI have established for issuing a clearance. \n \n\n \n6 \n                                         \n \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 at 2 \n(App. Bd. May 2, 1996). \n \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it \nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d \nISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). The burden of disproving a \nmitigating condition never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 \n(App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if they must, \non the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b). \n \nAnalysis \n \nCriminal Conduct \n \nAG \u00b6 30 describes the security concern about criminal conduct, \u201cCriminal activity \ncreates doubt about a person\u2019s judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. By its very \nnature, it calls into question a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations.\u201d \n \nAG \u00b6 31 lists two conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying in this case: \u201c(a) a pattern of minor offenses, any one of which on its own \nwould be unlikely to affect a national security eligibility decision, but which in combination \ncast doubt on the individual\u2019s judgment, reliability, or trustworthiness\u201d; and \u201c(b) evidence \n(including, but not limited to, a credible allegation, an admission, and matters of official \nrecord) of criminal conduct, regardless of whether the individual was formally charged, \nprosecuted, or convicted.\u201d  \n \nApplicant refuted the allegation of rape and infliction of injury. Applicant credibly \nexplained that he did not commit the rape and infliction of injury offenses. A did not make \na timely report of her allegations, and instead she waited until Applicant moved to a \ndifferent state. The police did not advise Applicant of his constitutional rights, and their \nonly interview of him was over the telephone. Applicant was never arrested or charged \nwith rape and/or infliction of injury.  \n \nIn February 2015, Applicant and C engaged in an oral argument that became \nphysical. Applicant admitted there was mutual pushing. Civil authorities charged him with \nDomestic Assault.     \n \n\n \n7 \n                                         \n \nIn July 2016, C accidently struck Applicant on the head, and he was injured. \nApplicant called 911, and went to the hospital. C told Applicant that she told the police \nApplicant assaulted her because she was worried that she would be accused of assault, \nand she might lose custody of her son. There is no evidence that she admitted to the \npolice that she lied about the Domestic Assault. Applicant was charged with Domestic \nAssault.  \n \nCivil authorities elected to charge Applicant with criminal offenses. This charging \ndecision means civilian authorities believed there was probable cause to believe he \ncommitted the charged offense. Probable cause exists where the facts and circumstances \nare reasonably trustworthy and \u201csufficient in themselves to warrant a man of reasonable \ncaution in the belief that an offense has been . . . committed.\u201d Brinegar v. United States, \n338 U.S. 160, 176 (1949). See also Texas v. Brown, 460 U.S. 730, 742 (1983) (plurality \nopinion) (probable cause does not require a fact to be \u201cmore likely true than false\u201d); \nEscobedo v. United States, 623 F.2d 1098, 1102 (5th Cir. 1980) (\u201cprobable cause\u201d means \n\u201cthe existence of a reasonable ground to believe the accused guilty\u201d) (internal quotation \nmarks omitted). \u201cFinely-tuned standards such as proof beyond a reasonable doubt or by \na preponderance of the evidence, useful in formal trials, have no place in the [probable-\ncause] decision.\u201d Illinois v. Gates, 462 U.S. 213, 235 (1983).  \n \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 31(a) and 31(b) are established. There is sufficient evidence of the two \nDomestic Assaults to warrant consideration of mitigating conditions. \n \nAG \u00b6 32 describes four conditions that could mitigate security concerns including: \n \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur and \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \n(b) the individual was pressured or coerced into committing the act and \nthose pressures are no longer present in the person's life; \n \n(c) no reliable evidence to support that the individual committed the offense; \nand \n \n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including, but not limited \nto, the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, restitution, \ncompliance with the terms of parole or probation, job training or higher \neducation, \ngood \nemployment \nrecord, \nor \nconstructive \ncommunity \ninvolvement. \n \nThe DOHA Appeal Board concisely explained Applicant\u2019s responsibility for proving \nthe applicability of mitigating conditions as follows:  \n \nOnce a concern arises regarding an Applicant\u2019s security clearance \neligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance of \n\n \n8 \n                                         \n \na security clearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th \nCir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991). After the Government \npresents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the \napplicant to rebut or mitigate those concerns. See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. The \nstandard applicable in security clearance decisions is that articulated in \nEgan, supra. \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access \nto classified information will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nDirective, Enclosure 2 \u00b6 2(b).  \n \nISCR Case No. 10-04641 at 4 (App. Bd. Sept. 24, 2013).  \n \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 32(a), 32(c), and 32(d) apply to the allegations of Domestic Assault in 2015 \nand 2016. Applicant\u2019s presentation at his security clearance hearing impeached the \nreliability of the evidence that he committed the offenses. The charges were dismissed, \nwhich is an indication civilian authorities did not believe there was sufficient probable \ncause to support the charge to take the cases to trial. Security clearance proceedings \nemploy the \u201csubstantial evidence\u201d evidentiary standard, which is \u201cmore than a scintilla but \nless than a preponderance.\u201d See v. Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, \n380 (4th Cir. 1994). Substantial evidence is \u201csuch relevant evidence as a reasonable mind \nmight accept as adequate to support a conclusion.\u201d Richardson v. Perales, 402 U.S. 389, \n401 (1971). See ISCR Case No. 15-05049 at 4 (App. Bd. July 12, 2017) (\u201cA Judge\u2019s \nmaterial findings must be based on substantial evidence or constitute reasonable \ninferences or conclusions that could be drawn from the evidence.\u201d) (citing ISCR Case No. \n12-03420 at 3 (App. Bd. Jul. 25, 2014)). The substantial evidence standard is more \nrigorous than the probable cause standard. TVA v. Whitman, 336 F.3d 1236, 1240 n. 6 \n(11th Cir. 2003). \n \nAfter careful assessment of Applicant\u2019s case in mitigation, I conclude there is not \nsubstantial reliable evidence of record that he committed the 2015 and 2016 Domestic \nAssaults. Applicant has a common law affirmative defense of self-defense to the 2015 \nDomestic Assault. He is legally permitted to use minimal reasonable amounts of force to \nextricate himself from the ongoing assault committed by C. When he pushed C, he was \nattempting to leave his residence to deescalate the emotion and risk of injury. His conduct \nwas reasonable and prudent. As for the 2016 allegation of Domestic Assault, C admitted \nto Applicant that she lied when she falsely accused him of assaulting her. Applicant is the \nperson who called 911 and the person who received medical attention.  \n \nIn addition, the offenses are not recent and did not involve serious injury to C. \nApplicant and C are separated, and the offenses are unlikely to recur. The offenses do \nnot cast doubt on Applicant\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment. Criminal \nconduct security concerns are mitigated.    \n \n \n \n\n \n9 \n                                         \n \nPersonal Conduct \n \nAG \u00b6 15 explains the security concern related to personal conduct as follows: \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. \n  \nAG \u00b6 16 lists conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying in this case including: \n \n(c) credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is \nnot sufficient for an adverse determination under any other single guideline, \nbut which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-person \nassessment of questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack \nof candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations, or other \ncharacteristics indicating that the individual may not properly safeguard \nclassified or sensitive information;  \n \n(d) credible adverse information that is not explicitly covered under any \nother guideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an adverse \ndetermination, but which, when combined with all available information, \nsupports a whole-person assessment of questionable judgment, \nuntrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with \nrules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that the individual \nmay not properly safeguard classified or sensitive information. This \nincludes, but is not limited to, consideration of: \n \n(1) untrustworthy or unreliable behavior . . . ; \n \n(2) any disruptive, violent, or other inappropriate behavior; \n \n(3) a pattern of dishonesty or rule violations; and   \n \n(e) personal conduct, or concealment of information about one\u2019s conduct, \nthat creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress by a \nforeign intelligence entity or other individual or group. Such conduct \nincludes:  \n \n(1) engaging in activities which, if known, could affect the person\u2019s \npersonal, professional, or community standing. \n \nAs discussed in the previous section, Applicant refuted the allegation that he \ncommitted rape and infliction of injury in 2010. He also refuted the allegation that he failed \n\n \n10 \n                                         \n \nto disclose the rape and/or infliction of injury charges on his May 2, 2018 SCA. The 2015 \nand 2016 Domestic Assaults establish AG \u00b6\u00b6 16(c), 16(d)(1) through (3), and 16(e)(1). \n \nAG \u00b6 17 lists conditions that could mitigate security concerns in this case including: \n \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, \nunreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to \nrecur; \n \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate vulnerability \nto exploitation, manipulation, or duress; and \n \n(f) the information was unsubstantiated or from a source of questionable \nreliability.  \n \nAs discussed in the previous section, AG \u00b6\u00b6 17(c), 17(d), 17(e), and 17(f) apply. \nPersonal conduct security concerns are mitigated. \n \nSexual Behavior \n \nAG \u00b6 12 describes the security concern arising from sexual behavior as follows: \n \nSexual behavior that involves a criminal offense; reflects a lack of judgment \nor discretion; or may subject the individual to undue influence of coercion, \nexploitation, or duress. These issues, together or individually, may raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s judgment, reliability, trustworthiness, and \nability to protect classified or sensitive information. Sexual behavior \nincludes conduct occurring in person or via audio, visual, electronic, or \nwritten transmission. No adverse inference concerning the standards in this \nGuideline may be raised solely on the basis of the sexual orientation of the \nindividual. \n \nAG \u00b6 13 lists conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying as follows: \n \n(a) sexual behavior of a criminal nature, whether or not the individual has \nbeen prosecuted; \n \n(b) pattern of compulsive, self-destructive, or high-risk sexual behavior that \nthe individual is unable to stop; \n\n \n11 \n                                         \n \n(c) sexual behavior that causes an individual to be vulnerable to coercion, \nexploitation, or duress; and \n \n(d) sexual behavior of a public nature or that reflects lack of discretion or \njudgment. \n \nSOR \u00b6 3.a cross-alleged the allegation in SOR \u00b6 1.a that Applicant \ncommitted rape in 2010. As discussed under the criminal conduct guideline, supra, \nApplicant refuted the allegation of rape. Sexual behavior security concerns are \nresolved for Applicant. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), \u201c[t]he ultimate determination\u201d of whether to grant a security \nclearance \u201cmust be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines\u201d and the whole-person concept. My comments under Guidelines J, E, \nand D are incorporated in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) \nwere addressed under those guidelines but some warrant additional comment. \n \nApplicant is a 31-year-old manufacturing engineer employed by a defense \ncontractor. In 2017, he received a bachelor\u2019s degree. He is currently seeking a master\u2019s \ndegree in business administration. Applicant served in the Navy as a combat medic from \n2006 to 2010. He served two combat tours, lost a close friend in combat, and eventually \nreceived a 100 percent service-connected disability rating for post-traumatic stress \ndisorder and traumatic brain injury. Applicant dragged a friend to safety on the battlefield, \nand he received a Bronze Star with \u201cV\u201d Device. He also received a Purple Heart, Navy \nand Marine Corps Achievement Medal, Combat Action Ribbon, Iraq Campaign Medal, \nGlobal War on Terrorism Service Medal, Global War on Terrorism Expeditionary Medal, \nNational Defense Service Medal, Sea Service Deployment Ribbon, and various medals \nfor his expertise with weapons.  \n \nApplicant refuted the allegations that he committed rape and infliction of injury in \n2010 and that he failed to disclose the felony charges of rape and/or infliction of injury on \n\n \n12 \n                                         \n \nhis May 2, 2018 SCA. He was not charged with rape and/or and infliction of injury. The \n2015 and 2016 Domestic Assaults are mitigated for the reasons stated previously. \n  \nI have carefully applied the law, as set forth in Egan, Exec. Or. 10865, the Directive, \nand the AGs, to the facts and circumstances in the context of the whole person. Criminal \nconduct, personal conduct, and sexual behavior security concerns relating to allegations \nof rape, infliction of injury, and failure to disclose information about these offenses on his \nSCA are refuted. Criminal conduct and personal conduct security concerns related to \nallegations of Domestic Abuse are mitigated.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n  \nParagraph 1, Guideline J: \nFOR APPLICANT  \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a, 1.b, and 1.c: \nFor Applicant \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E: \nFOR APPLICANT  \n \nSubparagraphs 2.a and 2.b:  \nFor Applicant \n \nParagraph 3, Guideline D: \nFOR APPLICANT  \n \nSubparagraph 3.a:  \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly \nconsistent with the interests of national security to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility \nfor a security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \n \n \n_________________________ \nMark Harvey \nAdministrative Judge \n",

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Under Guideline F, the Government alleged that Applicant did not file as required his federal income tax returns for the 2011 \u2013 2014 and 2016 tax years (SOR 1.a); that he did not file his state income tax returns for the same years (SOR 1.b); that he owes unpaid federal taxes totaling $68,702, a debt that is being enforced by a tax lien filed against him in 2017 (SOR 1.c); and that he owes $2,174 for a delinquent or past-due credit card account (SOR 1.d). Applicant admitted without explanation all four allegations. (FORM, Item 1) In response to the FORM, Applicant successfully refuted the allegation at SOR 1.d. On October 27, 2015, the creditor resolved that debt in Applicant\u2019s favor as a fraudulent use of his personal information. Applicant initially made that claim when he was interviewed by a government investigator in December 2018. In addition to the facts established by Applicant\u2019s admissions, I make the following findings of fact. (Response to FORM; FORM, Items 3 and 7) Applicant is a 60-year-old employee of a defense contractor, for whom he has worked since October 1991. Applicant and his wife have been married since April 2008, and he has lived in the same home since August 1998.

Driskill, Esq., Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro se \n \n \n12/05/2019 \n \n______________ \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \n \nMALONE, Matthew E., Administrative Judge: \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s response to the Government\u2019s adverse information about his finances \nwas not sufficient to overcome the trustworthiness concerns raised by his failure to timely \nfile his federal income tax returns and to timely pay his federal income taxes. Applicant\u2019s \nrequest for eligibility for a position of public trust is denied. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \n \nOn October 23, 2017, Applicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaire for \nInvestigations Processing (e-QIP) to obtain eligibility for a public trust position required \nfor his job with a defense contractor. After reviewing the results of the ensuing background \ninvestigation, adjudicators at the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications \nFacility (DOD CAF) were unable to determine, as required by DOD Directive 5220.6, as \namended (Directive), that it is clearly consistent with the interests of national security to \ngrant Applicant\u2019s request for a position of public trust. \n\n \n2 \n \nOn June 21, 2019, the DOD CAF issued Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) \nalleging facts raising trustworthiness concerns addressed through the adjudicative \nguideline (AG) for financial considerations (Guideline F). The adjudicative guidelines \napplied by adjudicators were issued by the Director of National Intelligence on December \n10, 2016, to be effective for all adjudications on or after June 8, 2017.  \n \nApplicant timely responded to the SOR and requested a decision without a \nhearing. On August 29, 2019, as provided for by paragraph E3.1.7 of the Directive, \nDepartment Counsel for the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued to \nApplicant a File of Relevant Material (FORM). The FORM contained seven documents \n(Items 1 \u2013 7) on which the Government relies to support the factual allegations in the \nSOR. Applicant received the FORM on September 30, 2019. He was informed he had 30 \ndays from the date of receipt to object to the use of the information included in the FORM \nand to submit additional information in response to the FORM.  \n \nOn November 4, 2019, Applicant submitted two documents in response to the \nFORM. They are identified as Applicant\u2019s Exhibit (AX) A (IRS Transcript, dated October \n30, 2019, two pages) and AX B (Capital One Bank letter to Applicant, dated October 27, \n2015, one page). Applicant did not object to the admissibility of any of the Government\u2019s \nexhibits. The record closed the same day when Department Counsel waived objection to \nthe admissibility of both exhibits. I received this case for decision on November 21, 2019. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nUnder Guideline F, the Government alleged that Applicant did not file as required \nhis federal income tax returns for the 2011 \u2013 2014 and 2016 tax years (SOR 1.a); that he \ndid not file his state income tax returns for the same years (SOR 1.b); that he owes unpaid \nfederal taxes totaling $68,702, a debt that is being enforced by a tax lien filed against him \nin 2017 (SOR 1.c); and that he owes $2,174 for a delinquent or past-due credit card \naccount (SOR 1.d). Applicant admitted without explanation all four allegations. (FORM, \nItem 1)  \n \n \nIn response to the FORM, Applicant successfully refuted the allegation at SOR 1.d. \nOn October 27, 2015, the creditor resolved that debt in Applicant\u2019s favor as a fraudulent \nuse of his personal information. Applicant initially made that claim when he was \ninterviewed by a government investigator in December 2018. In addition to the facts \nestablished by Applicant\u2019s admissions, I make the following findings of fact. (Response \nto FORM; FORM, Items 3 and 7) \n \n \nApplicant is a 60-year-old employee of a defense contractor, for whom he has \nworked since October 1991. Applicant and his wife have been married since April 2008, \nand he has lived in the same home since August 1998. (FORM, Item 2) \n \n \nIn Section 26 (Financial Record) of his e-QIP, Applicant disclosed that he did not \nfile his federal income tax returns on time for the tax years 2011 \u2013 2014. He further stated \nthat he filed those returns in 2016. In his e-QIP responses, Applicant also estimated that \nhe owed about $20,000 in unpaid federal income taxes for those years, and that he was \n\n \n3 \n \n\u201cworking with Tax Relief Agency and the IRS to pay off Federal tax debt.\u201d (FORM, Item \n2) \n \n \nIn response to interrogatories sent to Applicant by Department Counsel, Applicant \nprovided information showing that in December 2017, the IRS filed a substitute return for \nApplicant for the 2011 tax year; and that in January 2017, a substitute return was filed for \nhis 2012 income taxes. In response to the FORM, Applicant provided information showing \nthat he also did not file or pay his 2007 federal income taxes, with the IRS having filed a \nsubstitute return in October 2009. As of October 30, 2019, Applicant still owed the IRS \n$8,360 for the 2007 tax year. Applicant filed his federal returns for 2013 \u2013 2015 in \nDecember 2016. He filed his 2016 and 2017 returns in October 2018, and his 2018 return \nin June 2019. Applicant\u2019s state income tax returns were filed at or near the same time as \nhis federal returns. He could not file his state returns until his federal returns were filed \nbecause the federal information (e.g., adjusted gross income, tax deductions and credits, \netc.) were required as input to his state returns. As to all of his income tax returns, \nApplicant did not claim, and the record does not show, that he requested extensions for \nthe filing deadline in any of the tax years at issue here. (Response to FORM; FORM, \nItems 2 and 3) \n \n \nApplicant explained his failure to file his income tax returns as resulting from an \ninability to pay the additional taxes that were required when his returns were calculated. \nWith each passing year, he avoided filing his returns because he knew he still could not \npay, especially as the past-due amounts were adding up. Applicant has estimated he \nowes as much as $90,000 in unpaid federal taxes, penalties and interest. The record \ndoes not show that Applicant owes any unpaid state taxes. On June 30, 2017 the IRS \nobtained a federal tax lien against Applicant to enforce a $68,702 tax debt. As of June \n2019, Applicant was working with a tax consulting agency to address his past-due filings \nand his tax debts. On June 17, 2019, Applicant requested from the IRS transcripts of his \nfederal income tax accounts for the 2011 \u2013 2018 tax years. The same day, he proposed \na tax repayment agreement with the IRS whereby he would pay $990 monthly for 28 \nmonths to satisfy a $49,938.53 tax debt for the 2007 \u2013 2014 tax years. In July and August \n2019, Applicant made the first two of those payments. He did not submit any information \nthat addresses repayment of unpaid taxes for 2015 \u2013 2018 or of the $18,764 difference \nbetween his repayment plan and the federal tax lien against him. Additionally, the June \n2019 repayment agreement would repay only $27,720 of the $49,938 owed for 2007 \u2013 \n2014. (FORM, Items 3 and 6) \n \n \nAccording to the IRS transcript produced with Applicant\u2019s response to the FORM, \nhe earned $88,534 in 2007. The other IRS transcripts provided in response to \ninterrogatories show his average income between 2011 and 2018 was $115,828. \nApplicant did not present any additional information about his monthly finances, his \nmanagement of his personal finances, or any financial counseling aside from the tax \nconsulting services he obtained. (FORM, Item 3) \n \n \n\n \n4 \n \nPolicies \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nEligibility for a position of public trust must be based on a determination that it is \n\u201cclearly consistent with the interests of national security\u201d to do grant such access. Each \ndecision must be a fair, impartial, and commonsense determination based on examination \nof all available relevant and material information, and consideration of the pertinent \ncriteria and adjudication policy in the adjudicative guidelines. (See Directive, 6.3) \nDecisions must also reflect consideration of the factors listed in \u00b6 2(d) of the guidelines. \nCommonly referred to as the \u201cwhole-person\u201d concept, those factors are:  \n \n  \n(1) The nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nThe presence or absence of a disqualifying or mitigating condition is not \ndeterminative of a conclusion for or against an applicant. However, specific applicable \nguidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against them as they \nrepresent policy guidance governing the grant or denial of access to classified \ninformation. This decision is intended only to resolve whether it is clearly consistent with \nthe national interest for an applicant to either receive or continue to have access to \nsensitive information. (Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518 (1988))  \n \n \nThe Government bears the initial burden of producing admissible information on \nwhich it based the preliminary decision to deny or revoke an applicant\u2019s eligibility. \nAdditionally, the Government must be able to prove controverted facts alleged in the \nSOR. If the Government meets its burden, it then falls to the applicant to refute, extenuate \nor mitigate the Government\u2019s case. Because no one has a \u201cright\u201d to a position of public \ntrust, an applicant bears a heavy burden of persuasion. (See Egan, 484 U.S. at 528, 531) \nA person who has access to sensitive or protected information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government based on trust and confidence. Thus, the Government \nhas a compelling interest in ensuring each applicant possesses the requisite judgment, \nreliability and trustworthiness of one who will protect the national interests as his or her \nown. The \u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d standard compels resolution of any \nunresolved doubt about an applicant\u2019s suitability for eligibility in favor of the Government. \n(See Egan; AG \u00b6 2(b)) \n \nAnalysis \n \nFinancial Considerations \n \n \nThe Government\u2019s information supports the allegations that Appellant did not file \nhis federal and state income tax returns as required for the 2011 \u2013 2014 and 2016 tax \n\n \n5 \n \nyears. It also showed that Applicant owes at least $68,702 in unpaid federal income taxes \nfor those years. Although not alleged, Applicant\u2019s responsive information also shows that \nhe did not file his 2007 federal income tax return as required and that he still owes $8,360 \nin taxes for that year. The federal returns for the tax years at issue have been filed; \nhowever, some of those returns were filed as substitutes by the IRS, and none of his \nreturns were filed after approved filing extensions. His federal tax debt remains \nunresolved, and his failure to file as required appears deliberate and not the result of \nunforeseen circumstances. These facts reasonably raised some of the trustworthiness \nconcerns stated at AG \u00b6 18: \n \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of . . . . concern such as excessive gambling, mental health \nconditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \n[trustworthiness] concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, \nincluding espionage. \n \n \nMore specifically, available information requires application of the following AG \u00b6 \n19 disqualifying conditions: \n \n inability to satisfy debts;  \n \n \na history of not meeting financial obligations; and  \n \nfailure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired. \n \nOf the mitigating conditions listed under AG \u00b6 20, I considered the following as \npertinent to these facts and circumstances: \n  \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \n\n \n6 \n \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control;  \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority \nto file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \n \n \nOnly AG \u00b6 20(g) applies here. Applicant\u2019s financial problems are otherwise \nongoing, multiple, and have been a problematic aspect of his background since about \n2008, when first failed to file his federal income tax return as required. Applicant knew he \nwas required to file federal and state returns each year. By his own admission, he made \na decision in 2012 not to file his 2011 return because he could not afford the extra taxes \nhe would have to pay. He repeated that decision every year thereafter until finally \nengaging a tax consulting firm in June 2019. A recent debt repayment plan with the IRS \ndoes not address all of his unpaid taxes, and he has only made two of the 28 monthly \npayments required by the plan. Applicant also did not present any information about his \ncurrent finances or any financial counseling that would show that he will be able to avoid \nfinancial problems in the future. Applicant did not establish that his financial problems and \nnoncompliance with basic tax reporting and payment obligations arose from \nuncontrollable or unforeseen circumstances. Even in the alternative, his actions to resolve \nhis past-due filings and to pay his past-due taxes do not reflect responsible action under \nthe circumstances. For all of the foregoing reasons, application of AG \u00b6 20(g) is not \nsufficient to mitigate the reasonable trustworthiness concerns raised by the Government\u2019s \ninformation. On balance, Appellant has not presented sufficient information to mitigate \nthe trustworthiness concerns about his finances. \n \nIn addition to my evaluation of the facts and application of the appropriate \nadjudicative factors under Guideline F, I have reviewed the record before me in the \ncontext of the whole-person factors listed in AG \u00b6 2(d). Applicant is a mature adult who \nhas worked for the same company for 28 years. He is reasonably presumed to understand \nhis income tax reporting obligations, and he did not provide any information that shows \nhis conduct in this regard is not an accurate reflection of his judgement and reliability. My \nreview of all of the available information leaves unanswered the doubts about Applicant\u2019s \nsuitability for access to sensitive information that were raised by the adverse financial \ninformation examined in his background investigation. Because protection of the national \ninterest is the principal focus of these adjudications, any remaining doubts must be \nresolved against the individual. \n \n \n\n \n7 \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required by section \nE3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.c:  \nAgainst Applicant \n \nSubparagraph 1.d:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all available information, it is not clearly consistent with the interests of \nnational security for Applicant to have access to sensitive information. Applicant\u2019s request \nfor eligibility for a public trust position is denied. \n \n \n \n                                             \nMATTHEW E. MALONE \nAdministrative Judge \n",

The record in this case closed 22 August 2019, \nwhen Applicant=s response to the FORM was due. Applicant submitted no additional \ndocuments. DOHA assigned the case to me 26 September 2019. \n \n \n                                                 \n1DoD acted under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information Within Industry (February \n20, 1960), as amended; DoD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review \nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and Security Executive Agent Directive 4, effective 8 \nJune 2017.  \n\n \n \n2 \n \n \n \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant admitted failing to timely file his 2011-2018 state and Federal income tax \nreturns, and accumulating over $4,000 delinquent debt (SOR 1.a-1.I). Record evidence \nshows that SOR 1.a and 1.e are the same debt. He is a 52-year-old principal service \ntechnician employed by a U.S. defense contractor since May 2018. He has been \ncontinuously employed in similar (non defense) positions since at least November 2004. \nHe served honorably in the U.S. military from February 1987 to December 1997. He has \ntwice married and divorced, and has two adult sons with his first wife, and a  minor \ndaughter with his second wife. He held a clearance when he was in the military, but has \nnever held an industrial clearance. \n      \nApplicant disclosed failing to file his 2011-2018 state and Federal income tax \nreturns, and SOR debts 1.c., 1.d, and 1.g, on his June 2018 clearance application (Item \n2) He attributed them to his July 2011 divorce, and stated his intent to hire professional \nhelp to resolve his financial issues Applicant discussed his failures to file, and all the SOR \ndebts except SOR 1.c, during his November 2018 interview with a Government \ninvestigator (Item 3), based on his July 2018 credit report (Item 4). He attributed his failure \nto timely file his state and Federal income tax returns for the years at issue to his 2011 \ndivorce, the death of both parents, his being overwhelmed at work, and his child support \nissues. He had taken no action to resolve his tax issues or debts, but still intended to get \nprofessional help. His March 2019 credit (Item 5) report shows SOR debts 1.a-1.f still \nunresolved; SOR debt 1.g did not appear on Item 5 because it was reported by a different \ncredit agency. \n \nApplicant has no idea how much he owes in delinquent taxes, fees, and penalties. \nNo one knows about his financial issues except his children, but they are not aware of the \nextent of the problem. \n \nApplicant=s Answer (Item 1) admitted the SOR allegations, but did not otherwise \nilluminate his financial situation. Applicant documented no credit or financial counseling, \nand did not submit a budget. He provided no work or character references, or evidence \nof community involvement. \n \nPolicies \n \nThe adjudicative guidelines (AG) list factors for evaluating a person=s suitability for \naccess to classified information. Administrative judges must assess disqualifying and \nmitigating conditions under each issue fairly raised by the facts and situation presented. \nEach decision must also reflect a fair, impartial, and commonsense consideration of the \nfactors listed in AG & 2(a). Any one disqualifying or mitigating condition is not, by itself, \nconclusive. However, specific adjudicative guidelines should be followed where a case \ncan be measured against them, as they represent policy guidance governing access to \n\n \n \n3 \n \n \nclassified information. Considering the SOR allegations and the evidence as a whole, the \nrelevant adjudicative guideline is Guideline F (Financial Considerations). \n \nSecurity clearance decisions resolve whether it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant or continue an applicant=s security clearance. The Government \nmust prove, by substantial evidence, controverted facts alleged in the SOR. If it does,  \nthe burden shifts to applicant to refute, extenuate, or mitigate the Government=s case. \nBecause no one has a right to a security clearance, the applicant bears a heavy burden \nof persuasion. \n \nPersons with access to classified information enter into a fiduciary relationship with \nthe Government based on trust and confidence. Therefore, the Government has a \ncompelling interest in ensuring each applicant possesses the requisite judgement, \nreliability, and trustworthiness of those who must protect national interests as their own. \nThe Aclearly consistent with the national interest@ standard compels resolution of any \nreasonable doubt about an applicant=s suitability for access in favor of the Government.2 \n \nAnalysis \n \nThe Government established a case for disqualification under Guideline F, and \nApplicant failed to mitigate the security concerns. Applicant failed to timely file his 2011-\n2018 state and Federal income tax returns. His stated reasons for his failures do not \njustify seven years of complete inaction on his tax returns. Also, He documented no efforts \nto address his $4,000 delinquent debt.3  \n \nThe Appeal Board has long held that failure to timely file required tax returns may \ndemonstrate a lack of judgment inconsistent with access to classified information. \n \nA person who fails repeatedly to fulfill his or her legal \nobligations does not demonstrate the high degree of good \njudgment and reliability required of persons granted access to \nclassified information. Indeed, the Board has previously noted \nthat a person who has a history of not fulfilling their legal \nobligation to file income tax returns may be said not to have \ndemonstrated the high degree of judgment and reliability \nrequired for access to classified information.@4 \n \n                                                 \n2See, Department of the Navy v.

Jun. 27, 2000)(failure to file for five years). \n\n \n \n4 \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThis is true whether the failure to file is willful5 or attributed to the press of other \ncircumstances.6 As recently as December 2015, the Appeal Board upheld a denial of \nclearance, in a case notably similar to this, of an applicant who had failed to file Federal \nor state income tax returns for 10 years.  \n \nThe filing of tax returns is both a financial and a legal \nobligation. Applicant=s . . . failure to have done so for many \nyears is sufficient to raise a concern that he may be unwilling \nto follow other rules and regulations, such as those that \ngovern the handling of classified information. See, e.g., ISCR \nCase No. 14-01894 at 5 (App. Bd. Aug. 18, 2015) (A person \nwho fails repeatedly to fulfill his or her legal obligations does \nnot demonstrate the high degree of good judgment and \nreliability required of those granted access to classified \ninformation). See also Cafeteria & Restaurant Workers Union \nLocal 473 v. McElroy, 284 F.2d 173, 183 (D.C. Cir. 1960), \naff=d, 367 U.S. 886 (1961). Indeed, as the Judge noted, \nDirective, Enclosure 2 & 19(g) explicitly provides that failure \nto file tax returns is a circumstance that can raise a security \nconcern. Moreover, the Directive presumes a nexus between \nadmitted or proven conduct under any of the Guidelines and \nan applicant=s eligibility for a clearance. See. e.g., ISCR Case \nNo. 14-04648 at 3 (App. Bd. Sep. 9, 2015). ISCR Case No. \n14-02930 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 9, 2015). \n \nSecurity concerns under Guideline F are not limited to cases in which an Applicant \nis financially insolvent or is experiencing difficulty in paying debts. In this case his failure \nto timely file his Federal returns for two years leaves potentially unresolved tax debt, along \nwith the consumer debt. \n \n  \nApplicant meets none of the mitigating conditions for financial considerations. His \nindebtedness and his failures to timely file his Federal returns are multiple, recent, and \nongoing.7 Moreover, he has not demonstrated that his indebtedness and failures to timely \nfile over seven years were due to circumstances beyond his control, but even if I could \nconclude that the stated reasons justified the delay, it is clear that he has not been \n                                                 \n5See, ISCR Case No. 98-0801 (App. Bd.

De Angelis, Esq., Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro se \n09/24/2019 \n______________ \nDecision \n______________ \n \n \nGLENDON, John Bayard, Administrative Judge: \n \nThis case involves security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial \nConcerns). Applicant defaulted on five consumer accounts in 2018 and has admitted that \nhe owes these debts, which total about $30,000. He claims that his wife is seriously ill, \nbut he has not provided any evidence to establish that his delinquent debts were caused \nby her illness or a lack of insurance. He and his wife have recently filed a Chapter 13 \nbankruptcy petition. The record shows no further actions taken in that matter. Applicant \nhas provided insufficient evidence in mitigation. Eligibility for access to classified \ninformation is denied. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nOn May 18, 2018, Applicant filed a security clearance application (SCA) seeking \nto renew a previously granted clearance. On May 1, 2019, the Department of Defense \nConsolidated Adjudications Facility (DOD CAF) sent Applicant a Statement of Reasons \n(SOR) alleging security concerns under Guideline F. The DOD CAF acted under \nExecutive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, \n1960), as amended (Exec. Or.); DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel \nSecurity Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and \n\n2 \n \nSecurity Executive Agent Directive 4, National Security Adjudicative Guidelines \n(December 10, 2016) (AG) for all adjudicative decisions on or after June 8, 2017. \n \n \nApplicant responded to the SOR on May 31, 2019, and elected to have the case \ndecided on the written record in lieu of a hearing. He admitted all five of the SOR \nallegations, but failed to provide any information about mitigating circumstances or \nevidence.  \n \nDepartment Counsel submitted the Government\u2019s written case in an undated File \nof Relevant Material (FORM), which included seven attached documents (Items 1-7). A \ncomplete copy of the file of relevant material (FORM) was provided to Applicant, who was \nafforded an opportunity to file objections and to submit a written response and documents \nto refute, extenuate, or mitigate the security concerns raised by the SOR allegations. In \nresponse, he only provided a copy of his voluntary Chapter 13 bankruptcy petition, dated \nJuly 28, 2019.  \n \nApplicant raised no objection in his response to the admission of Item 7 attached \nto the Government\u2019s FORM, which is an unauthenticated report of investigation \nsummarizing Applicant\u2019s September 28, 2018 background interview. Department \nCounsel had advised Applicant in her FORM that he had the right to object to the \nadmissibility of this evidence as unauthenticated and that his failure to do so may \nconstitute a waiver of any objection he may have. He was also advised in the FORM that \nhe could provide corrections or updates to the information summarized in the document. \nIn his response to the FORM, he made no comments about Item 7. I conclude that he \nhas waived his right to object to the admissibility of this document. I have marked the \nItems attached to the FORM as Government Exhibit (GE) GE 1-7. I have marked \nApplicant\u2019s bankruptcy petition as Applicant Exhibit (AE) A. All documents are admitted \nwithout objection. The case was assigned to me on September 20, 2019. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nI have incorporated Applicant\u2019s admissions to the allegations set for in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 \n1.a-1.e in my findings of fact. Applicant\u2019s personal information is extracted from GE 4, his \nSCA, unless otherwise indicated by a parenthetical citation to the record. After a thorough \nand careful review of the pleadings, the Government\u2019s FORM and the documentary \nevidence in the record, I make the following findings of fact. \n \n \nApplicant is 35 years old and was married in 2012. He earned some college credits, \nbut transferred to a technical institute where he completed his studies in automotive and \ndiesel technology in 2010. He has worked in a number of positions since 2010, including \ntwo years (2012-2014) with a major defense contractor. Since October 2016, he has \nworked as a computer analyst for a government contractor, which is sponsoring him for \na clearance.  \n \n \nIn 2002, Applicant enlisted in the U.S. Marine Corps and served honorably for five \nyears until his discharge in 2007 with the rank of corporal (E-4). He was granted eligibility \n\n3 \n \nfor access to sensitive compartmented information (SCI) in 2003. He was again granted \nSCI eligibility in 2012 when he began working at the major defense contractor. He was \nunemployed for about ten months after he was terminated for cause by that contractor for \nhis misuse of a work computer system. The record is unclear whether he retained his top \nsecret and SCI eligibility prior to submitting the SCA. \n \n \nApplicant provided virtually no information regarding his financial problems except \nthat his wife has a serious illness and has accumulated uninsured medical bills in excess \nof $36,000. This information was just briefly mentioned in his September 2018 \nbackground interview and then with no details about any connection with his \nindebtedness, as alleged in the SOR and admitted in his response. As of the date of his \nbackground interview in September 2018 and presumably earlier while employed by his \nsponsor, Applicant had medical insurance that covered his wife\u2019s ongoing medical bills. \nThis coverage presumably continues with Applicant\u2019s employment with his sponsor. In \nhis background interview, he identified to the investigator six delinquent debts, five of \nwhich are now the subjects of the SOR allegations. He advised that he intended to pay \nthese debts through a Chapter 13 bankruptcy that he was preparing with his lawyer to \nfile. The bankruptcy petition was actually filed about 11 months later. He advised that his \nannual salary is $66,000. He made no mention of his wife\u2019s employment status. The \nChapter 13 petition reflects that his wife has not worked since sometime in 2017, when \nshe earned about $23,000 in that year. The record does not reflect the reason for her loss \nof income since 2017. (GE 7 at 3; AE A at 8-9.) \n \n \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.c \u2013 Two credit-card accounts with a credit union charged \noff in the amounts of $17,170 and $5,022, respectively \u2013 The credit reports in the \nrecord reflect that these accounts were opened in 2014 (SOR \u00b6 1.a) and 2017 (SOR \u00b6 \n1.c). Applicant defaulted on both in or about June 2018, and the credit union charged off \nboth accounts. Applicant commented in his September 2018 background investigation \nthat his bankruptcy attorney advised him not to pay anything on these two delinquent \naccounts or on any of the three other debts alleged in the SOR until ordered to do so by \nthe bankruptcy judge. These two debts and perhaps others debts owed to this creditor \nare included in Applicant\u2019s Chapter 13 bankruptcy petition. (GE 5 at 3; GE 6 at 2; GE 7 at \n3; AE A at 9 of 19.) \n \n \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d and 1.e \u2013 Two credit-card accounts with a bank charged off in the \namounts of $1,861 and $604, respectively \u2013 The credit reports in the record reflect that \nthese accounts were opened in 2014 (SOR \u00b6 1.d) and 2004 (SOR \u00b6 1.e). Applicant \ndefaulted on both in or about July 2018, and the bank charged off both accounts. These \ndebts appear to be included in his Chapter 13 bankruptcy petition. The record evidence \nsuggests that the two accounts were combined, and a civil court entered a judgment in \nthe total debt owed to this creditor. It is unclear however, if this assumption is correct \nbecause the last four digits of the listed account do not match the last four digits of either \ncredit card. Applicant has offered no clarification about the status of these debts under \nhis bankruptcy petition. (GE 5 at 2, 3; GE 6 at 2; AE A at 5 of 19.) \n \n\n4 \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.b \u2013 Healthcare credit account with a bank charged off in collection \nin the amount of $5,185 \u2013 The credit reports in the record reflect that this healthcare \ncredit account was opened in 2013. This may have been opened in connection with the \ntreatment of Applicant\u2019s wife. Applicant defaulted on the account in or about July 2018, \nand the bank placed the account with a collection agency. This debt is included in his \nbankruptcy petition. (GE 5 at 2; GE 6 at 2; AE A at 11 of 19.) \n \n \nThe record evidence contains virtually no information explaining why he defaulted \non these five debts. Perhaps his wife\u2019s illness forced her to leave her job, and the couple \nlost her income. There is no evidence in the record, however, to support such speculation \nis a fact. The record reflects that the couple bought a house in February 2017 and opened \na mortgage loan account at that time in the amount of $213,000 with a monthly payment \nof $1,121. In his bankruptcy petition, he valued his house to be worth $250,000. They \nalso own a former residence in a different state worth about $140,000. This home has \nbeen abandoned due to its poor condition. The record also reflects that Applicant opened \nan auto loan in August 2018 in the amount of about $22,000 with a monthly payment of \n$506. This vehicle apparently replaced a vehicle damaged by hail. In addition, his \nbankruptcy petition lists a number of other debts as joint debts of Applicant and his wife \nthat do not appear in either of Applicant\u2019s credit reports in the record or the SOR. The \ntotal of all of the unsecured debts owed by Applicant and his wife, as listed in his \nbankruptcy petition, is about $112,000. (GE 5 at 6; GE 6 at 2 GE 7 at 3; AE A at 11, 27, \n19 of 19.) \n \n \nAside from his Chapter 13 petition, Applicant offered no evidence regarding his \ndebts or his character. Since his petition was filed so recently, he has no additional \nbankruptcy records or other evidence regarding his repayment plan for his debts or any \ntrack record of having made payments to his creditors. His petition states that he received \ncredit counseling from an approved credit counselling agency within six months of the \nfiling of the petition. (AE A at 5.) \n \nPolicies \n \n \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 2.  \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge \napplies these guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \n\n5 \n \ndecision. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \n \n \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \n\u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \n \n \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 15-01253 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Apr.20, 2016). \n \n \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, \nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-\n31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \n \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-\n20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \n \nThe security concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18 as follows: \n \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \n\n6 \n \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. . . . An individual who is financially \noverextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or otherwise \nquestionable acts to generate funds. . . .  \n \n \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified information to raise money. It encompasses concerns about a \nperson\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting classified \ninformation. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s admissions in his SOR Answer and response to the FORM and the \ndocumentary evidence in the record establish the following potentially disqualifying \nconditions under this guideline: AG \u00b6 19(a) (\u201cinability to satisfy debts\u201d) and AG \u00b6 19(c) (\u201ca \nhistory of not meeting financial obligations\u201d). \n \n \nThe following mitigating conditions are potentially applicable: \n \nAG \u00b6 20(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not \ncast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \nAG \u00b6 20(b): the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n \nAG \u00b6 20(c): the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling \nfor the problem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit \ncredit counseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem \nis being resolved or is under control; and  \n \nAG \u00b6 20(d): the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to \nrepay creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(a) is not established. While Applicant\u2019s debts arose a number of years \nago, they remain delinquent. They are not infrequent, and the record contains insufficient \nevidence about the circumstances to support a conclusion that his delinquent debts are \nunlikely to recur. The evidence taken as a whole, including Applicant\u2019s long delay in filing \nhis bankruptcy petition, casts doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness and good \njudgment. \n \n\n7 \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(b) is partially established to the limited extent that the record reflects that \nApplicant\u2019s financial problems are related to his wife\u2019s illness. The record evidence does \nnot establish, however, that he has acted responsibly under the circumstances. He has \nnot submitted a repayment plan that he intends to file with the bankruptcy judge, and he \nhas no track record of payments at this point.  \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(c) is partially established. Applicant has taken a credit counselling course \nwith a legitimate and credible source in connection with his bankruptcy petition and has \ntaken steps that could lead to a successful resolution of his indebtedness by filing his \nbankruptcy petition. He has not, however, presented evidence that clearly indicates that \nhis financial problems are being resolved or are under control. At this point, he does not \neven have a proposed repayment plan, let alone a court-approved plan with a track record \nof payments under the plan. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(d) is partially established. The record contains evidence that Applicant \nhas initiated a good-faith effort to resolve his debts through a Chapter 13 bankruptcy filing, \nbut the proceeding has not progressed to the point where he has a court-approved \nrepayment plan and has a sufficient track record of payments to show that he not only \nintends to repay his debts, but is capable of doing so, and therefore is adhering to his \nrepayment efforts.  \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-\nperson concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances and applying the adjudicative factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). These factors are (1) \nthe nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the \nconduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the \nconduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other \npermanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for \npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or \nrecurrence. \n \n \nI have incorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis \nand applied the adjudicative factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). Some factors warrant additional \ncomments. I have taken into account Applicant\u2019s extensive amount of debt. I believe he \nhas taken a responsible first step to address his financial problems. His delay, however, \nfrom the summer of 2018 when he stopped paying his debts at the advice of his \nbankruptcy attorney until his actual filing of his Chapter 13 bankruptcy petition in July \n2019 has left him with little opportunity to present evidence to support a conclusion that \nhe is acting responsibly and with good judgment. Having taken this first step, it is simply \ntoo early in the bankruptcy process to know how that proceeding will turn out. Viewing the \n\n8 \n \nevidence as a whole, he has presented insufficient evidence to carry his burden of \npersuasion to mitigate the security concerns set forth in the SOR and to prove that he is \ntrustworthy and has good judgment.  \n \n \nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under Guideline F, and \nevaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has \nnot mitigated the security concerns raised by his delinquent debts. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \n \n \nParagraph 1. Guideline F:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a - 1.e:  \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national security interests of the \nUnited States to grant Applicant eligibility for access to classified information.

De Angelis, Esq., Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro se \n10/04/2019 \n______________ \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \nMARINE, Gina L., Administrative Judge: \n \nThis case involves trustworthiness concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial \nConsiderations) and Guideline H (Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse). Eligibility \nfor access to sensitive information is denied. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nApplicant submitted an electronic questionnaire for investigations processing for a \npublic trust position (eQIP) on October 16, 2018. On May 8, 2019, the Department of \nDefense Consolidated Adjudications Facility (DOD CAF) sent him a Statement of \nReasons (SOR) alleging trustworthiness concerns under Guidelines F and H. The DOD \nCAF acted under DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance \nReview Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative \nguidelines (AG) implemented by the DOD on June 8, 2017.  \n \nApplicant answered the SOR on June 5, 2019, and requested a decision on the \nwritten record without a hearing. On July 12, 2019, the Government sent Applicant a \ncomplete copy of its written case, a file of relevant material (FORM), including documents \nidentified as Items 1 through 7. He was given an opportunity to submit a documentary \nresponse setting forth objections, rebuttal, extenuation, mitigation, or explanation to the \nGovernment\u2019s evidence. He received the FORM on July 22, 2019, and did not respond. \n\n \n2 \n \nItems 1 through 3 are the pleadings in the case. Items 4 through 7 are admitted into \nevidence. The case was assigned to me on September 12, 2019. \n \nProcedural Matter \n \nI extracted the below findings of facts from Applicant\u2019s SOR Answer (Item 3), his \neQIP (Item 4), and a summary of his background interview (Item 5). Item 5 was not \nauthenticated as required by Directive \u00b6 E3.1.20. However, I conclude that Applicant \nwaived any objection to Item 5. In a section entitled \u201cIV. Important Notice to Applicant,\u201d \nthe Government notified Applicant of his right to object to the admissibility of Item 5 on \nthe ground that it was not authenticated. In that section, Applicant was also notified that \nif he did not raise any objection to Item 5 in his response to the FORM, or if he did not \nrespond to the FORM, he could be considered to have waived any such objection, and \nthat Item 5 could be considered as evidence in his case. Applicant received the FORM, \nwhich included a copy of Item 5. He did not respond to the FORM or otherwise object to \nItem 5.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant, age 34, has been married since 2014. He received his high school \ndiploma in 2003. He attended college from 2003 through 2006, without earning a degree. \nHe has been steadily employed full time since at least 2007, most recently as an analyst \nby a health insurer since June 2018. This is his first application for a public trust position.  \n \nWhen Applicant\u2019s husband lost his job in 2015, Applicant\u2019s income of $11 per hour \ndid not, alone, suffice to meet their expenses. They began to rely on credit cards to \u201cstay \nabove water.\u201d In about 2016, they maxed out credit cards, defaulted on their car loan, and \nfell behind on other expenses. After Applicant willfully surrendered the car to the lender, \nthe loan account was charged off in the amount of $10,800 (SOR \u00b6 1.a). A credit-card \naccount was placed for collection in the amount of $3,263 (SOR \u00b6 1.b). That debt was \nduplicated in SOR \u00b6 1.c. Three utility accounts totaling $1,067 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d, 1.f, and 1.g), \nand one $185 internet account (SOR \u00b6 1.e) were placed for collection. Applicant\u2019s six \ndelinquent debts totaling $15,315 remain unresolved. (Item 4 at 42-46; Item 5 at 4-6; Item \n6; Item 7)   \n \nApplicant proclaimed in his October 2018 eQIP, during his December 2018 \nbackground interview, and in his June 2019 SOR answer that he had been working to \nsettle or otherwise resolve his delinquent debts. While he affirmed each of the financial \nallegations in his SOR answer, he asserted that he did not owe any balance for the car \nloan because the creditor charged off the account, and had not attempted to collect any \nfurther money from him after the repossession. He plans to resolve the five collection \ndebts \u201cwithin the next couple of years, starting with the utility bills and smaller amounts, \nand eventually paying back all debts that are not charged off.\u201d (Item 3 at 4). Other than \nApplicant surrendering his car, the record does not specify what, if any, his debt resolution \nefforts have entailed or any documents corroborating those efforts.  \n \n\n \n3 \n \nDuring his December 2018 background interview, Applicant declared that he was \nliving within his means, able to pay his ongoing expenses, and had sufficient funds to \nkeep a balance of approximately $400 to 500 in his checking account that rolled over \neach month. He also stated that he and his husband were both gainfully employed. The \nrecord does not specify when his husband resumed employment after 2015, but he had \n\u201cextreme difficulty\u201d with \u201cobtaining gainful employment.\u201d Applicant\u2019s income increased \nwith his current employer such that it could alone suffice to meet their expenses \nregardless of whether his husband was employed. Applicant has not received any \nfinancial counseling. (Item 3 at 3; Item 5 at 6) \n \nApplicant used marijuana \u201csix to seven times a week\u201d from June 2009 through \nOctober 2018. He purchased it from an unspecified source for $200 to $300 every two \nweeks. During this period, he smoked it with his husband, friends, and family members \nat home together in a social setting. Applicant used marijuana as \u201ca crutch\u201d to cope with \nstress and anxiety. He acknowledged that his marijuana use \u201cheld [him] back in many \nareas of [his] life,\u201d and stated that he was \u201cnot likely to use marijuana in the future unless \nit becomes federally legal to use.\u201d He has learned alternative techniques for dealing with \nhis stress and anxiety, including \u201cmeditation, journaling, and talking with family.\u201d (Item 4 \nat 38-39; Item 5 at 2-3) \n \nApplicant tried LSD one time in December 2016. He used it with his husband at \nhome. He did not enjoy the experience and stated that there was a \u201czero chance\u201d he \nwould use LSD in the future. The motivation for his use was to \u201cescape reality\u201d for a \nmoment during a time when his mother was undergoing treatment for cancer. (Item 4 at \n38-39; Item 5 at 3) \n \nThe record did not specify with which friends or family members Applicant and his \nhusband used marijuana. However, Applicant averred that he and his husband have \ndiscontinued associating with \u201cpeople\u201d who use illegal drugs. The record did not specify \nwhether Applicant\u2019s husband stopped using marijuana and LSD. Applicant has never \nbeen professionally diagnosed as abusing drugs or being drug dependent. (Item 5 at 2-\n3) \n \nApplicant averred that he \u201cmade every attempt to turn [his] life around\u201d and was \n\u201cworking with a number of people to formulate a plan to continue improving.\u201d He asserted \nhis belief that \u201cthe issues described in the SOR\u201d do not represent \u201cany threat to the safety \nof confidential information\u201d that he may need to access during the course of his job. He \nmaintained that he had been \u201chonest and forthcoming\u201d in his SOR answer. He denied \nthat there was \u201cany possibility\u201d that the facts alleged in the SOR could be used to \u201ccoerce\u201d \nhim into \u201csurrendering confidential information.\u201d He did not believe that granting him \naccess to sensitive information would \u201cpose any threat\u201d to the U.S. government or its \ncitizens. (Item 3 at 4) \n \nPolicies \n \nPositions designated as ADP I and ADP II are classified as sensitive positions. The \nstandard that must be met for assignment to sensitive duties is that, based on all available \n\n \n4 \n \ninformation, the person\u2019s loyalty, reliability, and trustworthiness are such that assigning \nthe person to sensitive duties is clearly consistent with the interests of national security. \n(Directive, \u00a7 3.2). \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a position of trust to support a DOD \ncontract, an administrative judge must consider the disqualifying and mitigating conditions \nin the AG. (Directive, Enclosure 2). These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. \nInstead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge applies \nthe guidelines in a  commonsense manner, considering all available and reliable \ninformation, in arriving at a fair and impartial decision.  \n \nIn addition to the guidelines, the Directive sets forth procedures that must be \nfollowed in trustworthiness adjudications. The Government must present evidence to \nestablish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Once the Government establishes a \ndisqualifying condition by substantial evidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, \nexplain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts. An applicant has the ultimate burden of \npersuasion to establish their eligibility for a public trust position. (Directive, Enclosure 3, \n\u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.14, E3.1.15). The protection of the national security is the paramount \nconsideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) requires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being \nconsidered for access to national security eligibility will be resolved in favor of the national \nsecurity.\u201d The applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable \ntrustworthiness decision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to sensitive information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nsensitive information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard sensitive information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation of potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of sensitive information. \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F (Financial Considerations) \n \nThe concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \n \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \n\n \n5 \n \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds . . . .  \n \n \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise sensitive information to raise money. It encompasses concerns about a \nperson\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting sensitive \ninformation. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding sensitive information. (ISCR \nCase No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012).  \n \n \nBecause it duplicates another alleged debt, I found SOR \u00b6 1.c in Applicant\u2019s favor. \nAs to the remaining unresolved debts, Applicant\u2019s admissions and his credit reports \nestablish two disqualifying conditions under this guideline: AG \u00b6 19(a) (inability to satisfy \ndebts), and AG \u00b6 19(c) (a history of not meeting financial obligations). \n \n \nNone of the following potentially applicable mitigating conditions under this \nguideline are established: \n \nAG \u00b6 20(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not \ncast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment;  \n \nAG \u00b6 20(b): the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; and \n \nAG \u00b6 20 (d): the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to \nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \n \nApplicant has substantial delinquent debts that remain unresolved, despite his \ngainful employment since at least June 2018. He failed to demonstrate that he acted \nresponsibly to address them, particularly since he was spending $200 to $300 every two \nweeks through October 2018 on his marijuana use. The fact that his car-loan creditor \ncharged off his account does not relieve him of the obligation he has to repay the debt he \nincurred. His proffered plan to resolve his debts within the \u201cnext couple of years\u201d does not \nsuffice to establish that he has either initiated or is adhering to a good-faith effort to \nresolve his delinquent debts. Thus, I cannot conclude that Applicant has mitigated the \nGuideline F concerns.  \n \n \n \n\n \n6 \n \nGuideline H: Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \n \nThe concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 24:  \n \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual's reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior may \nlead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. Controlled substance means any \"controlled substance\" as \ndefined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term adopted in \nthis guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s use of marijuana and LSD establishes the following disqualifying \nconditions under this guideline:  \n \nAG \u00b6 25(a): any substance misuse (see above definition); and \n \nAG \u00b6 25(c): illegal possession of a controlled substance, including \ncultivation, processing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or \npossession of drug paraphernalia. \n \nThe following potentially applicable mitigating conditions under this guideline have \nnot been fully established: \n \nAG \u00b6 26(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \nhappened under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not \ncast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; and \n \nAG \u00b6 26(b): the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this \nproblem, and has established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not \nlimited to: (1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; (2) \nchanging or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; and (3) \nproviding a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug involvement \nand substance misuse, acknowledging that any future involvement or \nmisuse is grounds for revocation of national security eligibility. \n \nApplicant\u2019s LSD use, alleged in SOR \u00b6 2.b, was isolated and is unlikely to recur. \nThe same cannot be concluded for his frequent marijuana use over an extended period, \nwhich ended only a year ago. The fact that he illegally purchased the marijuana that he \nused exacerbates the concern. While he discovered alternative strategies for dealing with \nthe stress and anxiety to which he attributed his marijuana use, he has not established a \nsufficient pattern of abstinence. I am unable to conclude that his marijuana use is unlikely \n\n \n7 \n \nto recur, particularly given that he neither provided a signed statement of intent nor \nestablished that his husband and any of the family members with whom he continues to \nassociate no longer use marijuana or other illegal drugs. While I find SOR \u00b6 2.b in \nApplicant\u2019s favor, the concerns underlying his marijuana use have not been mitigated. I \nhave doubts about Applicant\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and judgment. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether the granting or continuing \nof national security eligibility is clearly consistent with the interests of national security \nmust be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful consideration of the \nadjudicative guidelines, each of which is to be evaluated in the context of the whole \nperson. In evaluating the relevance of an individual\u2019s conduct, an administrative judge \nshould consider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nI have incorporated my comments under Guidelines F and H in my whole-person \nanalysis, and I have considered the factors AG \u00b6 2(d). After weighing the disqualifying \nand mitigating conditions under Guidelines F and H, and evaluating all the evidence in \nthe context of the whole person, I conclude that Applicant has not mitigated \ntrustworthiness concerns raised by his financial indebtedness and marijuana use. \nAccordingly, Applicant has not carried his burden of showing that it is clearly consistent \nwith the interests of national security to grant him eligibility for a public trust position. \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required by Section \nE3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:   \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.b:  \nAgainst Applicant \n \nSubparagraph 1.c:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \nSubparagraphs 1.d \u2013 1.g:  \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \n\n \n8 \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:   \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \n \nAgainst Applicant  \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.b:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the interests of national security to \ngrant Applicant eligibility for a public trust position.

De Angelis, Esq., Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro se \n \n \nDecember 16, 2019 \nDecision \nGLENDON, John Bayard, Administrative Judge: \nThis case involves security concerns raised under Guideline F (financial \nconsiderations). Applicant failed to file her federal and state income tax returns as \nrequired for tax years 2014, 2015, and 2017, and she failed to fully pay her federal tax \nobligations for tax years 2014 through 2018. National security eligibility for access to \nclassified information is revoked. \nStatement of the Case \n \nOn June 2, 2016, Applicant submitted a security clearance application (SCA) \nseeking to renew a previously granted clearance. On June 20, 2019, the Department of \nDefense Consolidated Adjudications Facility (DOD CAF) sent Applicant a Statement of \nReasons (SOR) alleging security concerns under Guideline F. The DOD CAF acted under \nExecutive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, \n1960), as amended (Exec. Or.); DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel \nSecurity Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and \nSecurity Executive Agent Directive 4, National Security Adjudicative Guidelines \n(December 10, 2016) (AG) effective for all adjudicative decisions on or after June 8, 2017. \n\n2 \n \n \nApplicant responded to the SOR on July 17, 2019, and elected to have the case \ndecided on the written record in lieu of a hearing. She admitted all or part of the seven \nSOR allegations and provided one document and a written statement setting forth certain \nfacts in mitigation. Previously, she had responded to two sets of interrogatories regarding \nher tax-filing and payment history and a summary of her May 16, 2018 background \ninterview. \n \nDepartment Counsel submitted the Government\u2019s written case in an undated File \nof Relevant Material (FORM), which included six attached documents identified as Items \n1-6. A complete copy of the FORM was provided to Applicant, who was afforded an \nopportunity to file objections, submit a written response, and documents to refute, \nextenuate, or mitigate the security concerns raised by the SOR allegations. In a response \nreceived by DOHA on July 23, 2019, she provided a one-page statement with no \nattachments in mitigation of the issues raised in the SOR and the FORM. \n \nIn her response to the FORM, Applicant raised no objection to the admission of \nFORM Item 6, which included an unauthenticated report of investigation summarizing \nApplicant\u2019s May 16, 2018 background interview. In her FORM, Department Counsel had \nadvised Applicant that she had the right to object to the admissibility of this evidence as \nunauthenticated. Department Counsel also informed Applicant that she had failed to sign \nher earlier responses to DOHA\u2019s interrogatories, as required. In her response to the \nFORM, Applicant commented that she thought she had signed her interrogatory response \nand had not intentionally refused to sign the document. I conclude that she adopted her \ninterrogatory responses by virtue of making this statement in her response to the FORM \nand thereby adopted the summary of her background interview with the intent that it be \nincluded in the written record in this case. I have marked Items 1 through 6 attached to \nthe FORM as Government Exhibit (GE) 1-6, respectively. All documents, including \nApplicant\u2019s FORM response, are admitted without objection. The case was assigned to \nme on November 19, 2019. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nI have incorporated Applicant\u2019s admissions in her response to the allegations set \nforth in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.g in my findings of fact and have noted her denials. Applicant\u2019s \npersonal information is extracted from GE 4, her SCA, unless otherwise indicated by a \nparenthetical citation to the record. After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings, \nthe Government\u2019s FORM, and the documentary evidence in the record, I make the \nfollowing findings of fact: \n \n \nApplicant, 60, has married twice and divorced once. She has been separated from \nher current husband for a number of years and has had no recent contact with him. She \nhas three adult children from her first marriage. In 1977, she earned a high school \ndiploma. Since 2006, she has worked as an inspector for a DOD contractor. She has also \nworked part time since 2009 as a child-care provider. Applicant was granted a security \nclearance in 2007 in connection with her employment with the defense contractor. With \n\n3 \n \nthe submission of her June 2016 SCA, she seeks to renew her clearance eligibility. (GE \n6 at 5-6.) \n \n \nIn her SCA, she disclosed that she had failed to file her 2014 and 2015 federal and \nstate tax returns as required because she did not have the funds to pay her taxes. She \nalso wrote that she planned \u201cto resolve this shortly.\u201d In her May 2018 background \ninterview, she discussed her failure to file and pay only as to tax years (TY) 2014 and \n2015. She estimated that she owed $2,000 for each of the two years. She said that she \nintended to file and pay her taxes in 2018. Her response to DOHA\u2019s interrogatories \nrevealed for the first time that she also had failed to file her federal TY 2017 return on \ntime and had failed to pay her federal taxes each year from TY 2016 through 2018 in \naddition to TY 2014 and 2015. She disclosed that she owes approximately $17,000 in \nback taxes. (GE 6 at 8, 12.) \n \n \nWith her interrogatory responses, Applicant also provided IRS account transcripts \nfor TY 2014 through 2018. The transcripts reflect she filed her TY 2014 return on June \n17, 2019; her TY 2015 return on June 10, 2019; and her TY 2017 return on April 15, 2019. \nThe TY 2016 transcripts evidenced that Applicant\u2019s 2016 return was filed on August 7, \n2017 and that she had filed an extension, giving her until October 15, 2017 to file. \nAccordingly, this return was filed in a timely manner. The TY 2018 transcript shows that \nher return was filed on June 3, 2019, without an extension. On August 30, 2017, the IRS \nagreed to an installment payment plan of $100 per month for TY 2016. The 2016 tax \ntranscript shows that she made monthly payments of $100 for 19 months starting in \nOctober 2017 and ending in April 2019, leaving a balance due for TY 2016 of about \n$2,000. (GE 6 at 18-19, 20-33.) \n \n \nThe SOR alleges that Applicant failed to file her federal and state tax returns as \nrequired for a four-year period, TY 2014 through 2017, and that she owed delinquent \ntaxes for the five-year period TY 2014 through 2018 in the approximate amount of \n$18,000. Applicant admitted these allegations, except she denied that her TY 2016 \nfederal and state tax returns were not filed. She also explained that she had entered into \nan installment agreement to pay her delinquent federal taxes for TY 2016, but that \nagreement was suspended in mid-2019 due to the filing of her TY 2014, 2015, 2017, and \n2018 federal returns earlier in 2019.  \n \n \nThis evidence, along with Applicant admissions in her SOR response, establish \nthe facts alleged in the SOR, except for the allegation of late filing for TY 2016. According \nto the transcripts, she now owes approximately $21,000 in delinquent federal taxes. In a \nletter dated July 8, 2019, the IRS accepted Applicant\u2019s newly proposed installment-\npayment plan to pay $288 per month towards her back taxes. In her July 23, 2019 \nresponse to the FORM, she provided no evidence of any payments under this agreement. \n(GE 3 at 3; GE 6 at 20-33.) \n \n \nWith respect to her state tax returns, Applicant wrote in her interrogatory response \nthat she filed these returns on March 22, 2019 (TY 2014 and 2015); June 29, 2017 (TY \n2016); March 22, 2019 (TY 2017); and April 12, 2019 (TY 2018). Assuming that she filed \n\n4 \n \nfor an extension to file her 2016 return after April 15, 2017, as she did with the IRS, her \nTY 2016 and 2018 returns were timely filed and her TY 2014, 2015, and 2017 state \nreturns were not filed as required. She claims that she owes less than $100 in delinquent \nstate taxes. In response to DOHA\u2019s interrogatory request for state tax account transcripts \nfor the years in question, she wrote that her state tax authority does not provide annual \naccount transcripts or the equivalent. She did provide a letter from the state tax authority \nwith respect to tax year 2016, which shows that she owed a nominal amount for that year. \n(GE 5 at 9.) \n \n \nIn her SCA, background interview, and again in her SOR response, Applicant \nexplained that she fell behind on her tax filings and payments because she was unable \nto pay her taxes when they were due. She claims this was due to illness and two knee \nsurgeries, one in 2014 and a second in 2015. She asserts, without supporting evidence, \nthat she lost income because of these and other serious medical problems. That may be \ntrue, but her tax transcripts reflect that any loss of income was more than offset by other \nfactors. Using her 2014 income as a baseline, her adjusted gross income increased \nalmost $15,000 in 2015; $1,000 in 2016; $9,000 in 2017; and almost $6,000 in 2018. In \neach year, her taxes were not fully paid due to insufficient withholding or a failure to pay \nquarterly estimated taxes as a 1099 self-employed, independent contractor working in \nher part-time, child-care position. (GE 6 at 20-33.) \n \n \nThe record reflects that Applicant received financial counseling with respect to her \nconsumer and medical debts. With the assistance of a debt-consolidation firm, she paid \noff her credit cards and other debts and was basically debt free by the end of 2017. The \nrecord contains no evidence that she received any financial counseling from a legitimate \nand credible tax advisor, nor is there any evidence, except her history of medical \nproblems, as to why she did not attempt to address her unfiled tax returns and tax debts \nuntil 2019, with the single exception of her TY 2016 returns and delinquent taxes for that \nyear. (GE 6 at 8-10.)  \n \nPolicies \n \n \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 2.  \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge \napplies these guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \n\n5 \n \ndecision. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \n \n \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \n\u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \n \n \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 15-01253 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2016). \n \n \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, \nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-\n31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \n \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-\n20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \n \nThe security concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18 as follows: \n \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \n\n6 \n \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. . . . An individual who is financially \noverextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or otherwise \nquestionable acts to generate funds. . . .  \n \n \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified information to raise money. It encompasses concerns about a \nperson\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting classified \ninformation. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s admissions in her SOR answer, response to the FORM, and the \ndocumentary evidence in the record establish the following potentially disqualifying \nconditions under this guideline: AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) (\u201cinability to satisfy debts\u201d), 19(c) (\u201ca history \nof not meeting financial obligations\u201d), and 19(f) (failure to file . . . annual Federal, state, or \nlocal income tax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired\u201d). \n \n \nThe following mitigating conditions are potentially applicable: \n \nAG \u00b6 20(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not \ncast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \nAG \u00b6 20(b): the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n \nAG \u00b6 20(c): the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling \nfor the problem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit \ncredit counseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem \nis being resolved or is under control;  \n \nAG \u00b6 20(d): the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to \nrepay creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n \nAG \u00b6 20(g): the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax \nauthority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s dilatory behavior with respect to the filing of her tax returns and the \npayment of her taxes is recent, frequent, and occurred year after year under \n\n7 \n \ncircumstances that were not so unusual as to make it unlikely to recur. This behavior cast \ndoubts upon her current reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. AG \u00b6 20(a) is not \nestablished.  \n \n \nApplicant attributes her inability to pay her taxes to lost income caused by her knee \nsurgeries and recurring illnesses. These excuses in no way affected her ability to earn a \nliving during the 2014-to-2018 period or to file her tax returns on her own or with the \nassistance of a tax advisor. She claims that she lost pay due to being ill and was unable \nto work at times, but she failed to provide any evidence to support that claim. As noted, \nher annual income actually increased every year over the relevant period. This fact \nundercuts her claim that her poor health was the cause of her failure to pay her taxes. \nMoreover, the evidence demonstrates that Appellant failed to withhold sufficient taxes \nfrom her income or pay a sufficient amount of estimated taxes to cover her tax liability \neach year. To the extent that Applicant\u2019s health was a contributing factor to her tax \ndelinquencies, she failed to act responsibly under the circumstances. AG \u00b6 20(b) is only \npartially established.  \n \n \nApplicant presented no evidence that she received counseling to address her tax \ndelinquencies. She did receive counseling to help her with her consumer and medical \ndebts. She prioritized, however, paying these debts off a year or two before she began to \ndeal with her tax-filing delinquencies and indebtedness, with the exception of her 2016 \ntaxes. Applicant presented a July 2019 letter from the IRS showing that she finally was \nable to reach an installment payment plan with the IRS to begin to pay all of her past-due \ntaxes, not just one random year. This constitutes evidence that she is beginning to resolve \nher tax problems, but in the absence of evidence of any payments under this new \ninstallment agreement, the IRS letter does not constitute clear evidence that her problem \nis being resolved. AG \u00b6 20(c) is not established.  \n \n \nAs noted, Applicant has initiated a good-faith effort to resolve her tax debts, which \nfirst required her to file her tax returns. The absence of a track record of payments under \nthe new installment agreement, however, renders it impossible to characterize her efforts \nas adhering to that agreement. AG \u00b6 20(d) is not established.  \n \n \nApplicant has filed her federal tax returns and claims that she has also filed her \nstate tax returns. She has made appropriate arrangements with the IRS to begin to pay \nher delinquent taxes. Since those arrangements were finalized just a few days prior to the \nclose of the record, there is no evidentiary basis upon which it can be concluded that she \nis in compliance with her arrangements with the IRS. AG \u00b6 20(g) is partially established. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-\nperson concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \n\n8 \n \nsecurity clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances and applying the adjudicative factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). These factors are: \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct;  \n(2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation;  \n(3) the frequency and recency of the conduct;  \n(4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct;  \n(5) the extent to which participation is voluntary;  \n(6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent \nbehavioral changes;  \n(7) the motivation for the conduct;  \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and  \n(9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nI have incorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis \nand applied the adjudicative factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). Some factors warrant additional \ncomments. I have taken into account Applicant\u2019s age and maturity. As a mature person, \nshe knew better than to ignore her tax responsibilities, especially as a holder of a security \nclearance. As her income increased over the years, she emphasized the elimination of \nher consumer debts at the expense of meeting her obligations as a U.S. citizen to file and \npay her taxes through the payment of an appropriate amount of withholding taxes every \npay period. I have considered the seriousness of her behavior, and I have weighed the \nfact that she eventually filed her tax returns, but only after she applied to renew her \nclearance and it became evident that her clearance was in jeopardy. From the date of her \nfiling of her SCA in 2016, she has represented to the Government that she intends to \nresolve her tax problems in the near future. She did not, however, begin to address her \ntaxes in earnest until 2019. \n \n \nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under Guideline F, and \nevaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has \nnot mitigated the security concerns raised by her untimely tax filings and her delinquent \ntax debt. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \n \n \nParagraph 1. Guideline F:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a - 1.g:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \n \n \n\n9 \n \nConclusion \n \n \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national security interests of the \nUnited States to continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nClearance is revoked. \n \n \n \n \nJohn Bayard Glendon \nAdministrative Judge \n",

    "summary": "Findings of Fact The SOR alleges under Guideline H that Applicant used marijuana with varying frequency from about June 2010 to at least November 2018 (SOR \u00b6 1.a); that he used LSD and hallucinogenic mushrooms with varying frequency from about January 2014 to at least March 2017 (SOR \u00b6 1.b); and that he used the prescription medications Adderall, Ritalin, and Modafinil, which had not been prescribed for him, from about January 2016 to at least April 2017 (SOR \u00b6 1.c). When Applicant responded to the SOR allegations, he admitted that he used the drugs as alleged. He explained that he used marijuana for its medicinal benefits, including to relieve his anxiety and pain. Applicant denied any use of LSD and hallucinogenic mushrooms since March 2017 and any abuse of non-prescribed prescription drugs since April 2017. He expressed in writing an intention to abstain from all drug involvement and substance misuse with an acknowledgement that any future drug involvement be grounds for revocation of national security eligibility. After considering the pleadings, exhibits, and transcripts, I make the following findings of fact. Applicant is a 25-year-old data scientist. He earned his bachelor\u2019s degree in May 2016 and his master\u2019s degree in May 2017. He has been employed by a defense contractor since June 2017. (GE 1.) He has never held a DOD security clearance. (Tr. 17- 19.) Applicant understands that he does not need a clearance to keep his job, but a clearance would allow him to apply h",

Applicant has yet to establish that \nhis marijuana use will not recur. Clearance is denied. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \n \nOn June 26, 2019, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications Facility \n(DOD CAF) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant, detailing security concerns \nunder Guideline H, drug involvement and substance misuse. The SOR explained why the \nDOD CAF was unable to find it clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or \ncontinue security clearance eligibility for him. The DOD CAF took the action under \nExecutive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February \n20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security \nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the National \nSecurity Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified \n\n2 \n \nInformation or Eligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position (AG) effective within the DOD on June \n8, 2017. \n \nOn July 12, 2019, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations and requested a \ndecision based on the written record in lieu of a hearing. On August 1, 2019, the \nGovernment requested a hearing under \u00b6 E3.1.8 of the Directive. On August 7, 2019, the \ncase was assigned to me to conduct a hearing to determine whether it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant. On August \n28, 2019, I scheduled a hearing for September 26, 2019. \n \nAt the hearing held as scheduled, two Government exhibits (GEs 1-2) were admitted \nin evidence without any objections. Applicant testified, as reflected in a transcript (Tr.) \nreceived on October 15, 2019. I held the record open until October 11, 2019, for Applicant \nto submit character references from some of his co-workers and other documentation. No \ndocuments were received by the deadline. \n \nFindings of Fact \n  \n  \nThe SOR alleges under Guideline H that Applicant used marijuana with varying \nfrequency from about June 2010 to at least November 2018 (SOR \u00b6 1.a); that he used LSD \nand hallucinogenic mushrooms with varying frequency from about January 2014 to at least \nMarch 2017 (SOR \u00b6 1.b); and that he used the prescription medications Adderall, Ritalin, \nand Modafinil, which had not been prescribed for him, from about January 2016 to at least \nApril 2017 (SOR \u00b6 1.c). When Applicant responded to the SOR allegations, he admitted \nthat he used the drugs as alleged. He explained that he used marijuana for its medicinal \nbenefits, including to relieve his anxiety and pain. Applicant denied any use of LSD and \nhallucinogenic mushrooms since March 2017 and any abuse of non-prescribed prescription \ndrugs since April 2017. He expressed in writing an intention to abstain from all drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse with an acknowledgement that any future drug \ninvolvement be grounds for revocation of national security eligibility. After considering the \npleadings, exhibits, and transcripts, I make the following findings of fact. \n \nApplicant is a 25-year-old data scientist. He earned his bachelor\u2019s degree in May \n2016 and his master\u2019s degree in May 2017. He has been employed by a defense \ncontractor since June 2017. (GE 1.) He has never held a DOD security clearance. (Tr. 17-\n19.) Applicant understands that he does not need a clearance to keep his job, but a \nclearance would allow him to apply his skill-set to some classified programs at work. (Tr. \n21-22.) \n \nApplicant began using marijuana in June 2010 after his freshman year of high \nschool. He used marijuana approximately once every two months in high school and during \nhis first year of college. From the fall of 2013 to 2015, during his sophomore and junior \nyears of college, he used marijuana once a week. He used marijuana daily from sometime \nin 2015 through April 2017. Applicant used marijuana to decompress from academic \nstress. He used marijuana at parties, with friends, and with housemates. He also used the \ndrug by himself. Applicant purchased marijuana on occasion, no more frequently than once \n\n3 \n \na month, from 2014 to 2017. He bought marijuana from persons he did not know and also \nfrom and through friends. (GEs 1-2.) \n \nApplicant used hallucinogenic mushrooms approximately three times and LSD about \nfive times between January 2014 and March 2017. He also used, without a prescription, \nAdderall or Ritalin no more than 20 times total and Modafinil one time between January \n2016 and April 2017. He obtained the stimulants from friends. (GE 1.) \n \nAfter graduate school, Applicant stopped using illegal drugs, as it turns out \ntemporarily, thinking that it was time to be \u201cclear headed\u201d for employment. In June 2017, he \nbegan working for his current employer. He completed and certified to the accuracy of a \nQuestionnaire for National Security Positions (SF 86) on June 29, 2017. In response to an \ninquiry into whether he had illegally used any drug or controlled substance in the last seven \nyears, Applicant reported that he engaged in recreational marijuana use with \u201cscattered\u201d \nfrequency from June 2010 to 2015 and then daily through April 2017. He also disclosed his \nuse of LSD and hallucinogenic mushrooms between January 2014 and March 2017 \n\u201c[r]ecreationally, motivated by studying the brain and once going to a music festival, highly \nirregular.\u201d Applicant denied any intention to use marijuana in the future, stating, \u201cI intend to \nkeep a clear head throughout my professional adult life.\u201d He also denied any intention of \nfuture involvement with LSD or hallucinogenic mushrooms, stating, \u201cMy reasons for use \ncarry no more weight moving forward, rendering these drugs irrelevant and undesirable in \nmy life moving forward.\u201d In answer to an inquiry concerning any illegal drug purchases in \nthe last seven years, Applicant reported that he had bought marijuana no more than once a \nmonth between January 2014 and February 2017, explaining that \u201crecreational use of \nmarijuana required occasional purchase.\u201d In response to an SF 86 question about any \nintentional misuse of a prescription drug in the last seven years, Applicant listed his use of \nAdderall, Ritalin, and Modafinil, which he obtained from friends. (GE 1.) \n \n On November 16, 2018, Applicant was interviewed by an authorized investigator for \nthe Office of Personnel Management (OPM). Applicant admitted that he had used \nmarijuana with current and previous college roommates. He volunteered that he had used \nmarijuana on average once a day from November 2017 to November 3, 2018, with his \nlatest use occurring at a party. He denied that he ever used marijuana at the workplace, \nbut admitted that he had used marijuana in December 2017 and again in September 2018 \nwhile teleworking, in order to alleviate pain so he could get his work done. (Tr. 24.) He \nadmitted that his current employer was not aware of his marijuana use. Applicant likened \nhis marijuana use to having a drink. He expressed no intention to seek out marijuana in the \nfuture, but he could not rule out recurrence. He asserted that he would be prepared to \nabstain from marijuana if necessary for his clearance. As for his attitude toward marijuana, \nApplicant explained that he had always used it for social, creative, or calming purposes, \nand he did not think it was a big deal. He considered himself a \u201ccasual user\u201d of marijuana. \nHe denied any other illegal drug use since 2017 and any interest in using hallucinogens or \nnon-prescribed stimulants in the future. (GE 2.) \n \nOn June 26, 2019, the DOD CAF issued a SOR to Applicant because of his drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse. When he responded to the SOR on July 12, 2019, \n\n4 \n \nApplicant explained that his marijuana use was for its medicinal benefits, primarily to \nrelieve anxiety and pain. He considered his use of the drug \u201cinnocuous\u201d but regretful in that \nit cast doubt on his ability to perform his job and be trusted with classified information. He \nexpressed in writing his intention to abstain from all drug involvement and substance \nmisuse in the future, acknowledging that any future involvement would be grounds for \nrevocation of national security eligibility. He denied any use of hallucinogenic drugs or \nmisuse of prescription drugs since 2017.  \n \n \nAt his September 26, 2019 hearing, Applicant reiterated that there had been no \nrecurrence of involvement with LSD or hallucinogenic mushrooms since March 2017 or any \nmisuse of prescription stimulants since April 2017. He asserted that such abuse would not \nrecur. (Tr. 16-17.) He volunteered that, believing he would not be granted a security \nclearance because of his marijuana use, he continued to use marijuana since November \n2018 \u201cevery other day perhaps,\u201d including two to three times per week since July 12, 2019. \n(Tr. 18-19, 26-27.) Most of that use was self-initiated and purchased by him to relieve \nmedical issues. He also used marijuana recreationally with his friends five or six times. (Tr. \n31-32.) His most recent use of marijuana occurred at a party in mid-September 2019. (Tr. \n24-25.) When asked to explain why he used marijuana after he had expressed in writing \nthat he would not use marijuana in the future, he responded, \u201cLike I said, use of marijuana \nhas never affected my ability to perform my job, and I know that from experience.\u201d (Tr. 23.) \nHe cited the relief that marijuana brings him in terms of mitigating his anxiety, depression, \nand pain; described himself as \u201ca guy who occasionally likes to smoke marijuana with his \nfriends;\u201d but he also asserted a willingness and ability to stop using marijuana if it would \nprevent him from being granted a security clearance. (Tr. 18-20.) Applicant testified that he \nwould very much like to contribute to the classified components of some of the programs in \nwhich he is involved (Tr. 22), and that he does not need marijuana in his life. He expressed \nconfidence that he would never use marijuana again \u201csubject to the possibility of getting a \nsecurity clearance.\u201d (Tr. 28.) He expressed a willingness to undergo drug tests to prove \nabstention. (Tr. 29, 35.) \n \n \nApplicant has not had any drug counseling nor has he sought any medical treatment \nfor those issues that he self-medicates with marijuana (Tr. 25), although he acknowledged \nthat he should seek treatment for his anxiety and depression. (Tr. 31.) He does not suffer \nfrom chronic pain, but has occasional discomfort that he treats with marijuana rather than \nover-the-counter analgesics because the relief is more effective and immediate. (Tr. 25-\n26.) Recreational use of marijuana has been decriminalized in his state, and he testified \nthat his use of marijuana has been consistent with state law. (Tr. 18-19.) He is aware that \nmarijuana remains illegal under federal law. (Tr. 33-34.) He does not have a medical \nmarijuana card. (Tr. 26.) Applicant has three housemates who use marijuana. One of these \nhousemates is a college friend with whom Applicant has used marijuana. (GE 2; Tr. 30.) \nThere have been some occasions since July 2019 where Applicant was offered marijuana, \nincluding by one of his housemates, and he declined. (Tr. 37.) No one at Applicant\u2019s work \nis aware of his marijuana use. (Tr. 36.) \n\n5 \n \nPolicies \n \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion the Executive \nBranch has in regulating access to information pertaining to national security,  emphasizing \nthat \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 \nU.S. 518, 528 (1988). When evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, \nthe administrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are required to be considered in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. These guidelines \nare not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, \nthese guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative \nprocess. The administrative judge\u2019s overall adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious \nscrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative \njudge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, \nfavorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence \nto establish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant \nis responsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation about potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Section 7 of EO 10865 \nprovides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a \ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section \n3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information). \n\n6 \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline H: Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \n \nThe security concerns about drug involvement and substance misuse are set forth in \nAG \u00b6 24: \n \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of prescription \nand non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances that cause \nphysical or mental impairment or are used in a manner inconsistent with their \nintended purpose can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability and \ntrustworthiness, both because such behavior may lead to physical or \npsychological impairment and because it raises questions about a person\u2019s \nability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations. Controlled \nsubstance means any \u201ccontrolled substance\u201d as defined in 21 U.S.C. 802. \nSubstance misuse is the generic term adopted in this guideline to describe \nany of the behaviors listed above. \n  \nIn addition to the above matters, I note that the Director of National Intelligence \n(DNI) issued an October 25, 2014 memorandum concerning adherence to federal laws \nprohibiting marijuana use. In doing so, the DNI emphasized three things. First, no state can \nauthorize violations of federal law, including violations of the Controlled Substances Act, \nwhich identifies marijuana as a Schedule I controlled drug. Second, changes to state laws \n(and the laws of the District of Columbia) concerning marijuana use do not alter the \nnational security adjudicative guidelines. And third, a person\u2019s disregard of federal law \nconcerning the use, sale, or manufacture of marijuana remains relevant when making \neligibility decisions for sensitive national security positions. \n \nApplicant has used marijuana with varying frequency since June 2010. After going to \nwork for his employer and completing an SF 86 in June 2017 on which he indicated that he \ndid not intend to use marijuana in the future, Applicant used marijuana daily from \nNovember 2017 to November 2018 and then every other day until July 2019, when he \nindicated in writing his \u201cintention to abstain from all drug involvement and substance \nmisuse, acknowledging that any future involvement or misuse is grounds for revocation of \nnational security eligibility.\u201d He continued to use marijuana two to three times per week to \nat least mid-September 2019. Additionally, while in college and graduate school, Applicant \nused LSD five times and hallucinogenic mushrooms three times between January 2014 \nand March 2017. He also abused controlled stimulants (Ritalin, Adderall, and Monafinil) \nwithout a prescription approximately 21 times total from January 2016 to April 2017. \nApplicant obtained the hallucinogens and stimulants illegally from friends. He purchased \nmarijuana illegally from friends and strangers. The SOR does not specifically allege that \nApplicant purchased illegal drugs or used marijuana after he stated he would not use it \nagain, but I cannot ignore the circumstances of his marijuana use when evaluating its \nsecurity significance. Disqualifying conditions AG \u00b6 25(a), \u201cany substance misuse (see \nabove definition);\u201d AG \u00b6 25(c), \u201cillegal possession of a controlled substance, including \ncultivation, processing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of drug \n\n7 \n \nparaphernalia;\u201d and AG \u00b6 25(g), \u201cexpressed intent to continue drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, or failure to clearly and convincingly commit to discontinue such use,\u201d  \nare established. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 26(a), \u201cthe behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt on the \nindividual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment,\u201d has little applicability in \nmitigation. Applicant\u2019s involvement with illegal hallucinogens was infrequent and \nrecreational, but it cannot be viewed in isolation from his other drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse. His abuse of prescription stimulants approximately 21 times over a 16-\nmonth time span was certainly recurrent. Applicant\u2019s regular use of marijuana for the past \nnine years, not only while socializing but also to alleviate anxiety, depression, and \noccasional pain, continues to cast serious doubt about his judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 26(b) provides for mitigation when an individual acknowledges his or her drug \ninvolvement and has no intention of future drug activity: \n \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and substance \nmisuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and \nhas established a pattern of abstinence, including but not limited to: \n \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; \n \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; and \n \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that any future \ninvolvement or misuse is grounds for revocation of national security eligibility. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 26(b) applies in mitigation of Applicant\u2019s involvement with LSD and \nhallucinogenic mushrooms, and his illegal use of prescription stimulants.  He has \nrepeatedly disavowed any intention to use these substances in the future, and his present \nabstinence of 2.5 years is consistent with that intention to abstain. There is no evidence \nthat he has sought out these controlled substances since college. \n \nHowever, with respect to his marijuana use, Applicant has not established the \ndisassociation from drug-using associates, the change in circumstances, a sustained \nperiod of abstinence, or the demonstrated intention to forego any future drug involvement.  \nApplicant abstained from marijuana for only a few months after he indicated on his SF 86 \nthat he intended \u201cto keep a clear head throughout [his] professional life.\u201d After executing a \nstatement of intention to abstain from marijuana for security clearance eligibility, he \ncontinued to use marijuana two to three times a week, knowing as he did so that he was \nviolating federal law and that the DOD was concerned about his drug use. His present \nwillingness to abstain from marijuana if necessary for a security clearance and to submit to \ndrug testing to prove abstention is not enough in reform, given the conditional nature of his \n\n8 \n \nwillingness to abstain; his failure to abide by similar statements in the past; his choice of \nmarijuana over legal, alternative means to deal with mental health issues and occasional \npain; and his continued friendships with marijuana users. \n \nThe \u201cBond Amendment,\u201d which  is codified at 50 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 3343, prohibits the grant \nor renewal of national security eligibility to an individual who is currently an unlawful user of \na \u201ccontrolled substance\u201d as that term is defined in 21 U.S.C. \u00a7  802 and referenced in AG \u00b6 \n24. Under Appendix B of the National Security Adjudicative Guidelines, the Bond \nAmendment applies to DOHA proceedings. Applicant continued to use marijuana to within \nlittle more than a week before his September 2019 hearing. He now promises that, \u201csubject \nto the possibility of getting a security clearance, [he] would never use marijuana again.\u201d \nApplicant may not be statutorily disqualified from being granted security clearance eligibility \nunder the circumstances, but he has failed to clearly and convincingly commit to \ndiscontinue his marijuana use. The drug involvement and substance misuse security \nconcerns raised by his years of marijuana use are not adequately mitigated. \n \nWhole-Person Concept  \n  \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of his conduct and \nall relevant circumstances in light of the nine adjudicative process factors in AG \u00b6 2(d): \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances \nsurrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the \nfrequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at \nthe time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which participation is voluntary; (6) \nthe presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral \nchanges; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, \ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or \nrecurrence. \n \nIn making the overall commonsense determination required under AG \u00b6 2(c), I note \nthat Applicant is the sole source of information about his illegal drug use. To the extent that \nhe has cooperated with the investigation and adjudication process, it is an important \nconsideration in his favor. He candidly disclosed during his September 2019 hearing that \nhe continued to use marijuana two to three times a week after being placed on notice in the \nSOR of the security concerns raised by his illegal drug involvement and substance misuse. \nHowever, it is well settled that once a concern arises regarding an applicant\u2019s security \nclearance eligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or renewal of a security \nclearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th Cir. 1990). The Government \nmust be able to rely on those persons seeking security clearance eligibility to comply with \nthe federal drug laws without regard to their personal interests. For the reasons discussed, \nApplicant has raised considerable doubt in that regard. \n\n9 \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline H:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.b-1.c: \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances, it is not clearly consistent with the national \ninterest to grant eligibility for a security clearance for Applicant. Eligibility for access to \nclassified information is denied. \n \n \n____________________ \nElizabeth M. Matchinski \nAdministrative Judge \n \n",

Applicant\u2019s admissions are incorporated herein as findings of fact. After a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, and upon due consideration of same, I make the following additional findings of fact: Applicant is a 31-year-old employee of a defense contractor.

Nagel, Esquire, Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro se \n10/24/2019\nDecision \nGALES, Robert Robinson, Administrative Judge: \nApplicant failed to mitigate the security concerns regarding financial \nconsiderations. Eligibility for a security clearance is denied. \nStatement of the Case \nOn May 1, 2018, Applicant applied for a security clearance and submitted a \nQuestionnaire For National Security Positions (SF 86). On May 31, 2019, the Department \nof Defense (DOD) Consolidated Adjudications Facility (CAF) issued a Statement of \nReasons (SOR) to him, under Executive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended and modified; \nDOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program \n(January 2, 1992), as amended and modified (Directive); and Directive 4 of the Security \nExecutive Agent (SEAD 4), National Security Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) (December \n10, 2016), for all covered individuals who require initial or continued eligibility for access \nto classified information or eligibility to hold a sensitive position, effective June 8, 2017. \n\n \n2 \n                                      \n \n The SOR alleged security concerns under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) \nand detailed reasons why the DOD adjudicators were unable to find that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant. \nThe SOR recommended referral to an administrative judge to determine whether a \nclearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked.  \n \n \nIn a sworn statement, dated June 7, 2019, Applicant responded to the SOR, and \nhe elected to have his case decided on the written record in lieu of a hearing. (Item 1) A \ncomplete copy of the Government\u2019s file of relevant material (FORM) was mailed to \nApplicant by the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) on July 10, 2019, and \nhe was afforded an opportunity after receipt of the FORM to file objections and submit \nmaterial in refutation, extenuation, or mitigation. In addition to the FORM, Applicant was \nfurnished a copy of the Directive as well as the Adjudicative Guidelines applicable to his \ncase. It is unclear when Applicant received the FORM as there is no receipt in the case \nfile. After receiving an extension from DOHA, his response was due on September 16, \n2019. Applicant chose not to respond to the FORM, for as of October 22, 2019, no \nresponse had been received.  The case was assigned to me on October 22, 2019.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nIn his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted all of the factual allegations \npertaining to financial considerations in the SOR (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a. through 1.f.). Applicant\u2019s \nadmissions are incorporated herein as findings of fact. After a complete and thorough \nreview of the evidence in the record, and upon due consideration of same, I make the \nfollowing additional findings of fact:  \n \nApplicant is a 31-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has been serving \nas a technical service engineer with his current employer since October 2012. He enlisted \nin the Army National Guard, and served from February 2008 until February 2015, when \nhe was honorably discharged. He is a 2006 high school graduate. He was granted a \nsecret clearance in 2008. He was married in 2013, and divorced in 2016. He has one \nchild, born in 2012.  \n \nFinancial Considerations \n \nGeneral source information pertaining to the financial accounts discussed below \ncan be found in the following exhibits: Item 4 (Combined Experian, TransUnion, and \nEquifax Credit Report, dated May 25, 2018); Item 5 (Equifax Credit Report, dated April 2, \n2019); Item 6 (Equifax Credit Report, dated July 8, 2019); Item 3 (Enhanced Subject \nInterview, dated July 9, 2018); Item 2 (SF 86, dated May 1, 2018); and Item 1 (Applicant\u2019s \nAnswer to SOR, dated June 7, 2019).  \nIn his SF 86, Applicant listed several delinquent accounts, and he attributed his \nfinancial difficulties to his divorce; his ex-wife\u2019s failure to make car payments; and child \nsupport payments. (Item 2, at 33-37) On July 31, 2018, he was interviewed by an \ninvestigator with the U.S. Office of Personnel Management (OPM). At that time, he \nexplained that because of the divorce and a relocation to an out-of-state location for a \n\n \n3 \n                                      \n \nnew job, he became short on funds and was unable to maintain his accounts in a current \nstatus. He contended that he had attempted to pay his creditors a little at a time and that \nhe was saving money to enable him to pay off his debts. In doing so, he altered his \nspending habits, and no longer uses credit cards. (Item 3, at 4) He was questioned about \nhis delinquent accounts, and he acknowledged that two vehicles were repossessed \nbecause he was not making any payments; and that he had made no payments on two \nother accounts. He also claimed that he had made a couple payments for one account, \nand that he was making monthly payments on another account. (Item 3, at 3-4) However, \nApplicant failed to submit any documents such as statements from the creditors agreeing \nto a repayment plan, cancelled checks, copies of money orders, a bank register, or \nreceipts, to indicate that any payments had been made to any creditor. \nThe SOR alleged six delinquent accounts totaling approximately $38,104. Those \nallegations are set forth below: \nSOR \u00b6 1.a.: This is an automobile loan on a 2016 vehicle with an unpaid balance \nof $12,930 that was charged off after the vehicle was repossessed. (Item 4, at 11; Item \n5, at 2) Applicant acknowledged that he has not been making any payments. (Item 3, at \n3; Item 1) The account is not yet in the process of being resolved. \nSOR \u00b6 1.b.: This is a credit-card account with an unpaid balance of $12,582. (Item \n4, at 12; Item 5, at 12; Item 6, at 1-2) Applicant\u2019s July 2019 credit report notes that $13,982 \nwas charged off. (Item 6, at 2) Applicant contended that he was making monthly payments \nto the creditor, but he did not state the amount of the payments, or when those payments \ncommenced. However, Applicant\u2019s July 2019 credit report notes that a $50 payment was \nreceived in June 2019, and that the current balance of the account was $12,432. (Item 6, \nat 1-2) The account is in the process of being resolved. \nSOR \u00b6 1.c.: This is a credit-card account with an unpaid balance of $6,475 that \nwas charged off. (Item 4, at 11; Item 5, at 2; Item 3, at 4) Applicant contended that he \n\u201cmade a couple payments\u201d to the creditor, but he did not state the amount of the \npayments, or when those payments commenced. He failed to submit any documentation, \nsuch as cancelled checks, copies of money orders, a bank register, or receipts, to support \nhis contention that he has made any payments to the creditor. In the absence of such \ndocumentation, I conclude that the account is not yet in the process of being resolved. \nSOR \u00b6 1.d.: This is a joint automobile loan on a 2012 vehicle with an unpaid \nbalance of $4,367 that was allegedly charged off after the vehicle was repossessed. (Item \n4, at 12; Item 5, at 2; Item 6, at 3-4) Applicant\u2019s July 2019 credit report notes that $6,681 \nwas actually charged off. (Item 6, at 4) Applicant acknowledged that he has not been \nmaking any payments. (Item 3, at 3; Item 1) The account is not yet in the process of being \nresolved. \nSOR \u00b6 1.e.: This is a credit-card account with an unpaid balance of $1,414 that \nwas charged off and sold to a debt purchaser. (Item 4, at 12; Item 5, at 2; Item 6, at 2, 5) \n\n \n4 \n                                      \n \nApplicant acknowledged that he has not been making any payments. (Item 3, at 3; Item \n1) The account is not yet in the process of being resolved. \nSOR \u00b6 1.f.: This is credit-card account with an unpaid balance of $336 that was \ncharged off. (Item 4, at 11; Item 5, at 2; Item 6, at 2) Applicant acknowledged that he has \nnot been making any payments. (Item 3, at 4; Item 1) The account is not yet in the process \nof being resolved. \nIt is not known what Applicant\u2019s current financial resources may be because he did \nnot report his current net monthly income; monthly expenses; and any monthly remainder \nthat might be available for discretionary spending or savings. There is no evidence of a \nbudget. There is no evidence of financial counseling. In the absence of additional financial \ninformation, it remains difficult to determine if Applicant is currently in a better position \nfinancially than he had been.  \nPolicies \n \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the Executive \nBranch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security emphasizing, \n\u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d (Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. \n518, 528 (1988)) As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to control \naccess to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual \nis sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information. The President has \nauthorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant an applicant eligibility for \naccess to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to do so.\u201d (Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \nIndustry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified.)     \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the guidelines in SEAD 4. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the guidelines list potentially disqualifying \nconditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility \nfor access to classified information. \n \nAn administrative judge need not view the guidelines as inflexible, ironclad rules \nof law. Instead, acknowledging the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. The entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known \nas the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a meaningful decision. \n \nIn the decision-making process, facts must be established by \u201csubstantial \nevidence.\u201d \u201cSubstantial evidence [is] such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might \naccept as adequate to support a conclusion in light of all contrary evidence in the record.\u201d  \n(ISCR Case No. 04-11463 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2006) (citing Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1))  \n\n \n5 \n                                      \n \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d  (See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994)) \n \nThe Government initially has the burden of producing evidence to establish a \npotentially disqualifying condition under the Directive, and has the burden of establishing \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Once the Government has produced substantial \nevidence of a disqualifying condition, under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant has the \nburden of persuasion to present evidence in refutation, explanation, extenuation or \nmitigation, sufficient to overcome the doubts raised by the Government\u2019s case. The \nburden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government. (See ISCR \nCase No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005)) \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours as well. It is \nbecause of this special relationship that the Government must be able to repose a high \ndegree of trust and confidence in those individuals to whom it grants access to classified \ninformation. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the \napplicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. Such \ndecisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather \nthan actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Furthermore, \u201csecurity clearance \ndeterminations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d (Egan, 484 U.S. at 531) \n \nClearance decisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense \nbe a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d (See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 \n7) Thus, nothing in this decision should be construed to suggest that I have based this \ndecision, in whole or in part, on any express or implied determination as to Applicant\u2019s \nallegiance, loyalty, or patriotism. It is merely an indication the Applicant has or has not \nmet the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for \nissuing a clearance.  In reaching this decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that \nare reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I \nhave avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG \u00b6 18:  \n      \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \n\n \n6 \n                                      \n \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19:  \n \n(a) inability to satisfy debts;  \n \n(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so; and \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations.  \nApplicant had six delinquent accounts totaling approximately $38,104. Two \nvehicles were repossessed because he was not making any payments, and he, \nadmittedly, had made no payments on two other accounts, claiming that he had \ninsufficient funds to maintain his accounts in current status. AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and 19(c) have \nbeen established, but there is no evidence that Applicant has been unwilling to satisfy his \ndebts regardless of an ability to do so, and AG \u00b6 19(b) has not been established. \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns arising from financial difficulties under AG \u00b6 20: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; and \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \n  \n\n \n7 \n                                      \n \nAG \u00b6 20(b) minimally applies, but none of the other conditions apply. A debt that \nbecame delinquent several years ago is still considered recent because \u201can applicant\u2019s \nongoing, unpaid debts evidence a continuing course of conduct and, therefore, can be \nviewed as recent for purposes of the Guideline F mitigating conditions.\u201d ISCR Case No. \n15-06532 at 3 (App. Bd. Feb. 16, 2017) (citing ISCR Case No. 15-01690 at 2 (App. Bd. \nSept. 13, 2016)). The nature, frequency, and recency of Applicant\u2019s continuing financial \ndifficulties, and his failure to voluntarily and timely resolve his delinquent accounts for \nseveral years, make it rather easy to conclude that it was not infrequent and it is likely to \nremain unchanged, much like it has been for several years. Applicant attributed his \nfinancial problems to his divorce; the maintenance of two separate homes; his ex-wife\u2019s \nfailure to make car payments; and child support payments. He did not specify how those \nissues impacted his finances.  \n \nAn applicant who begins to resolve his financial problems only after being placed \non notice that his or her security clearance is in jeopardy may be lacking in the judgment \nand self-discipline to follow rules and regulations over time or when there is no immediate \nthreat to his or her own interests. (See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 17-01213 at 5 (App. Bd. Jun. \n29, 2018); ISCR Case No. 17-00569 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Sept. 18, 2018). Applicant \ncompleted his SF 86 in May 2018; underwent his OPM interview in July 2018; the SOR \nwas issued in May 2019; and he received the FORM sometime in July or August 2019. \nEach step of the security clearance review process placed him on notice of the \nsignificance of the financial issues confronting him. While it appears that Applicant made \nat least one $50 payment to one of his creditors in June 2019 \u2013 after the SOR was issued \n\u2013 and offered an unverified comment that he had made a couple of unspecified payments \non another account, he essentially failed to address his other delinquent accounts.  \n \nClearance decisions are aimed at evaluating an applicant\u2019s judgment, reliability, \nand trustworthiness. They are not a debt-collection procedure. The guidelines do not \nrequire an applicant to establish resolution of every debt or issue alleged in the SOR. An \napplicant needs only to establish a plan to resolve financial problems and take significant \nactions to implement the plan. There is no requirement that an applicant immediately \nresolve issues or make payments on all delinquent debts simultaneously, nor is there a \nrequirement that the debts or issues alleged in an SOR be resolved first. Rather, a \nreasonable plan and concomitant conduct may provide for the payment of such debts, or \nresolution of such issues, one at a time.  \nIt should be noted that the Appeal Board has indicated that promises to pay off \ndelinquent debts in the future are not a substitute for a track record of paying debts in a \ntimely manner and otherwise acting in a financially responsible manner. (ISCR Case No. \n07-13041 at 4 (App. Bd. Sep. 19, 2008) (citing ISCR Case No. 99-0012 at 3 (App. Bd. \nDec. 1, 1999)) In this instance, with one exception, there is no evidence supported by \ndocumentation that Applicant has taken any corrective actions with respect to his \ndelinquent debts. There are substantial unverified comments by Applicant that he \nresolved or started to resolve some delinquent accounts, but he offered no documentation \nto support his contentions. His contentions regarding the status of some accounts, and \nhis unverified comments claiming that he had taken certain actions, without documents, \n\n \n8 \n                                      \n \nto support his claims, are insufficient to reflect good-faith actions. The Appeal Board has \npreviously explained what constitutes a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \notherwise resolve debts: \nIn order to qualify for application of [the \u201cgood-faith\u201d mitigating condition], an \napplicant must present evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or some other good-faith action aimed at resolving the \napplicant\u2019s debts. The Directive does not define the term \u201cgood-faith.\u201d \nHowever, the Board has indicated that the concept of good-faith \u201crequires \na showing that a person acts in a way that shows reasonableness, \nprudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.\u201d Accordingly, an \napplicant must do more than merely show that he or she relied on a legally \navailable option (such as bankruptcy [or statute of limitations]) in order to \nclaim the benefit of [the \u201cgood-faith\u201d mitigating condition].  \n \n(internal citation and footnote omitted) ISCR Case No. 02-30304 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 20, \n2004) (quoting ISCR Case No. 99-9020 at 5-6 (App. Bd. June 4, 2001). \n \nThere is no evidence of financial counseling or a budget. In the absence of \nadditional financial information, it remains difficult to determine if Applicant is currently in \na better position financially than he had been. Applicant\u2019s actions, or inaction, under the \ncircumstances cast doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. \nSee ISCR Case No. 09-08533 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Oct. 6, 2010). \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6 2(d): \n  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nUnder SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. Moreover, I have \nevaluated the various aspects of this case in light of the totality of the record evidence \nand have not merely performed a piecemeal analysis. See U.S. v. Bottone, 365 F.2d 389, \n392 (2d Cir. 1966); see also ISCR Case No. 03-22861 at 2-3 (App. Bd. Jun. 2, 2006).  \n\n \n9 \n                                      \n \nThere is some evidence in favor of mitigating Applicant\u2019s financial concerns. \nApplicant is a 31-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has been serving as a \ntechnical service engineer with his current employer since October 2012. He enlisted in \nthe Army National Guard, and served from February 2008 until February 2015, when he \nwas honorably discharged. He is a 2006 high school graduate. He was granted a secret \nclearance in 2008. \n \nThe disqualifying evidence under the whole-person concept is simply more \nsubstantial. Applicant had a number of delinquent accounts totaling approximately \n$38,104. Two vehicles were repossessed, and four other accounts became delinquent, \nand were essentially ignored by him until after the SOR was issued. Applicant claimed \nthat he had started addressing two of the accounts, but acknowledged that he had made \nno payments on the other four accounts. However, because of his failure to submit \ndocumentation associated with his delinquent accounts, such as receipts, cancelled \nchecks, or bank account transactions, to support his contentions that some payments \nhave actually been made to two of his creditors, it is difficult to assess the true situation, \nfor we have only Applicant\u2019s unverified comments claiming that he had taken certain \nactions. \n \nIn ISCR Case No. 07-06482 at 2-3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008), the Appeal Board \naddressed a key element in the whole-person analysis in financial cases stating: \n \nIn evaluating Guideline F cases, the Board has previously noted that the \nconcept of \u201cmeaningful track record\u201d necessarily includes evidence of actual \ndebt reduction through payment of debts. However, an applicant is not \nrequired, as a matter of law, to establish that he [or she] has paid off each \nand every debt listed in the SOR. All that is required is that an applicant \ndemonstrate that he [or she] has \u201c. . . established a plan to resolve his [or \nher] financial problems and taken significant actions to implement that plan.\u201d \nThe Judge can reasonably consider the entirety of an applicant\u2019s financial \nsituation and his [or her] actions in evaluating the extent to which that \napplicant\u2019s plan for the reduction of his outstanding indebtedness is credible \nand realistic. See Directive \u00b6 E2.2(a) (\u201cAvailable, reliable information about \nthe person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, should be \nconsidered in reaching a determination.\u201d) There is no requirement that a \nplan provide for payments on all outstanding debts simultaneously. Rather, \na reasonable plan (and concomitant conduct) may provide for the payment \nof such debts one at a time. Likewise, there is no requirement that the first \ndebts actually paid in furtherance of a reasonable debt plan be the ones \nlisted in the SOR. \n \nWhile Applicant contended that he took certain actions with respect to his \ndelinquent debts, there is no documentary evidence to indicate that any of those accounts \nhave been addressed. Applicant\u2019s current track record is poor at best. Overall, the \nevidence leaves me with substantial questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and \nsuitability for a security clearance. For all of these reasons, I conclude Applicant has failed \n\n \n10 \n                                      \n \nto mitigate the security concerns arising from his financial considerations. See SEAD 4, \nApp. A, \u00b6\u00b6 2(d)(1) through AG 2(d)(9). \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparas 1.a., and 1.c.through 1.f.: \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.b.:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \n In light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact The SOR alleged that Applicant owes $24,129 for a home equity line of credit (SOR 1.a). In response to the SOR, Applicant admitted the allegation. He also provided a statement to explain how the debt came about, and he provided a copy of an agreement with the collection agency that now owns the account. (FORM, Items 1 and 3). In addition to the facts established by Applicant\u2019s admissions, I make the following findings of fact. Applicant is a 70-year-old employee of a defense contractor, for whom he has worked since October 1997. He stated in his e-QIP that he first received a security clearance in June 1996. Applicant also served in the U.S. Army between 1970 and 1973. He and his wife have been married since August 1988, when they bought a house used as their marital residence until May 2007. At that time, Applicant bought a second house in which he and his wife still reside. Applicant still owns his previous residence, which he has been using as a rental property since moving in 2007. (FORM, Items 4 and 5) The debt alleged at SOR 1.a represents the balance due from a home equity line of credit (HELOC) Applicant obtained in 2006 for his rental property. At some point he stopped paying that account, and it was charged off by the lender as a business loss in 2015. The required monthly payment had been $143.

De Angelis, Esq., Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro se \n \n \n12/12/2019 \n \nDecision \nMALONE, Matthew E., Administrative Judge: \n \nApplicant did not provide sufficient information to overcome the security concerns \nraised by his financial problems. Applicant\u2019s request for eligibility for access to classified \ninformation is denied. \nStatement of the Case \n \nOn April 10, 2018, Applicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaire for \nInvestigations Processing (e-QIP) to obtain or renew eligibility for access to classified \ninformation as part of his employment with a defense contractor. After reviewing the \ncompleted background investigation, adjudicators at the Department of Defense \nConsolidated Adjudications Facility (DOD CAF) could not determine that it was clearly \nconsistent with the interests of national security for Applicant to have access to classified \ninformation, as required by Executive Order 10865, as amended, and by DOD Directive \n5220.6 (Directive). \n\n \n2 \n \nOn June 21, 2019, the DOD CAF issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) alleging \nfacts that raise security concerns addressed under Guideline F (Financial \nConsiderations). The adjudicative guidelines (AG) cited in the SOR were issued by the \nDirector of National Intelligence on December 10, 2016, to be effective for all \nadjudications on or after June 8, 2017. Applicant timely responded to the SOR (Answer) \nand requested a decision without a hearing. \n \nOn August 29, 2019, as provided for by paragraph E3.1.7 of the Directive, \nDepartment Counsel for the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued to \nApplicant a File of Relevant Material (FORM). The FORM contained seven documents \n(Items 1 \u2013 7) on which the Government relies to establish the facts alleged in the SOR. \nApplicant received the FORM on September 24, 2019, and he was informed he had 30 \ndays from the date of receipt to object to the use of the information included in the FORM \nand to submit additional information in response to the FORM.  \n \nAdditionally, Applicant was specifically advised in Section IV of the FORM that he \ncould comment on the accuracy of, or object to the admission of, FORM Item 5 (Summary \nof Personal Subject Interview, dated July 20, 2018). The record closed on October 24, \n2019, after Applicant did not respond to the FORM or object to the consideration of any \nof the Government\u2019s exhibits. I received this case for decision on November 25, 2019. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nThe SOR alleged that Applicant owes $24,129 for a home equity line of credit (SOR \n1.a). In response to the SOR, Applicant admitted the allegation. He also provided a \nstatement to explain how the debt came about, and he provided a copy of an agreement \nwith the collection agency that now owns the account. (FORM, Items 1 and 3). In addition \nto the facts established by Applicant\u2019s admissions, I make the following findings of fact. \n \n \nApplicant is a 70-year-old employee of a defense contractor, for whom he has \nworked since October 1997. He stated in his e-QIP that he first received a security \nclearance in June 1996. Applicant also served in the U.S. Army between 1970 and 1973. \nHe and his wife have been married since August 1988, when they bought a house used \nas their marital residence until May 2007. At that time, Applicant bought a second house \nin which he and his wife still reside. Applicant still owns his previous residence, which he \nhas been using as a rental property since moving in 2007. (FORM, Items 4 and 5) \n \n \nThe debt alleged at SOR 1.a represents the balance due from a home equity line \nof credit (HELOC) Applicant obtained in 2006 for his rental property. At some point he \nstopped paying that account, and it was charged off by the lender as a business loss in \n2015. The required monthly payment had been $143. Applicant claimed that he was not \nable to meet his HELOC obligations because of a loss of income that coincided with the \nneed for extensive repairs on his rental property. Applicant also claimed that he was beset \nby renters who did not honor their leases and who damaged his property.  \n \n \nIn July 2018, Applicant was interviewed by a government investigator about the \nSOR 1.a debt and other financial problems he had experienced beginning in 2000. \n\n \n3 \n \nApplicant stated at that time his intention to finish remodeling his rental property to market \nit to renters and cover the mortgages on that property. In response to the SOR a year \nlater, Applicant stated that he had spent $25,000 since 2017 to restore his rental property, \nwhich was empty and not earning revenue during that time. As of July 2019, Applicant \nclaimed that he now has renters and is using a management company to \u201cstay on top of \nthings.\u201d Available information shows that Applicant actually owes $39,976 for this debt, \nwhich is now in collection with another creditor. (FORM, Items 3, 5, and 7) \n \n \nAdditionally, Applicant provided with his Answer information showing that on July \n26, 2019, he executed an agreement with the collection agency now holding the SOR 1.a \ndebt. That agreement provided that Applicant would make a $1,740.92 down payment \nand 11 monthly payments of $367.92. If Applicant makes all of the payments required \ntherein by July 2020, his credit report will be updated to show he is current on the HELOC, \nand the original terms of the HELOC will be restored and his monthly payments lowered \nto near their previous amount. In short, Applicant has entered into a loan rehabilitation \nagreement with the collection agency. Applicant made the required down payment on \nJuly 16, 2019. He did not provide any information that shows he took other actions to \nresolve his debt between 2015 and 2019. He also has not sought or received any financial \ncounseling, and the record does not contain any information about his current monthly \nfinances. (FORM, Item 3) \n \nPolicies \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nEach security clearance decision must be a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndetermination based on examination of all available relevant and material information, \nand consideration of the pertinent criteria and adjudication policy in the adjudicative \nguidelines (AG). (See Directive, 6.3) Decisions must also reflect consideration of the \nfactors listed in \u00b6 2(d) of the guidelines. Commonly referred to as the \u201cwhole-person\u201d \nconcept, those factors are:  \n \n  \n(1) The nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nThe presence or absence of a disqualifying or mitigating condition is not \ndeterminative of a conclusion for or against an applicant. However, specific applicable \nguidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against them as they \nrepresent policy guidance governing the grant or denial of access to classified \ninformation. A security clearance decision is intended only to resolve whether it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest for an applicant to either receive or continue to have \naccess to classified information. (Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518 (1988))  \n \n\n \n4 \n \n \nThe Government bears the initial burden of producing admissible information on \nwhich it based the preliminary decision to deny or revoke a security clearance for an \napplicant. Additionally, the Government must be able to prove controverted facts alleged \nin the SOR. If the Government meets its burden, it then falls to the applicant to refute, \nextenuate or mitigate the Government\u2019s case. Because no one has a \u201cright\u201d to a security \nclearance, an applicant bears a heavy burden of persuasion. (See Egan, 484 U.S. at 528, \n531) A person who has access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship \nwith the Government based on trust and confidence. Thus, the Government has a \ncompelling interest in ensuring each applicant possesses the requisite judgment, \nreliability and trustworthiness of one who will protect the national interests as his or her \nown. The \u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d standard compels resolution of any \nreasonable doubt about an applicant\u2019s suitability for access in favor of the Government. \n(See Egan; AG \u00b6 2(b)) \n \nAnalysis \n \nFinancial Considerations \n \n \nAvailable information shows that Applicant has been delinquent on the debt at \nSOR 1.a since 2015. That debt remains unresolved. This information reasonably raises \nthe security concerns articulated, in relevant part, at AG \u00b6 18 as follows: \n \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial obligations may \nindicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and \nregulations, all of which can raise questions about an individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and ability to protect classified or sensitive information. . . . . An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to engage in \nillegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \n \n \nMore specifically, the Government\u2019s information requires application of the \nfollowing AG \u00b6 19 disqualifying conditions: \n \n(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so; and \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \n \n \nAll three conditions apply because Applicant did not pay or otherwise resolve his \nHELOC debt despite having the time and means with which to do so. He claims he spent \n$25,000 on renovations needed to restore the property, yet he did not continue to pay the \n$143 each month required by the terms of the line of credit. He did not take any action on \nthis debt for almost four years; however, after receiving an SOR, he has decided to pay \nmore than twice the original monthly amount as part of his loan rehabilitation agreement. \n \n \n\n \n5 \n \n \nI have also considered the following AG \u00b6 20 mitigating conditions: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; and \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \n \n \nNone of these mitigating conditions apply. Although the debt may have arisen from \ncircumstances beyond his control, Applicant did not establish that he acted responsibly \ngiven those circumstances. Applicant\u2019s debt remains unresolved despite having the \nmeans with which to do so. He has not pursued any financial counseling or other \nprofessional assistance in addressing his debt, and the fact that he waited until receiving \nthe SOR to begin a loan rehabilitation program with a collection agency precludes a \nconclusion that his actions in resolution are done in good faith. On balance, Applicant has \nnot met his burden of production or persuasion to mitigate the security concerns raised \nby the Government\u2019s information. \n \nIn addition to my evaluation of the facts and application of the appropriate \nadjudicative factors under Guideline F, I have reviewed the record before me in the \ncontext of the whole-person factors listed in AG \u00b6 2(d). My review of all of the available \ninformation leaves unanswered the doubts about Applicant\u2019s suitability for access to \nclassified information that were raised by his financial problems. Because protection of \nthe national interest is the principal focus of these adjudications, any remaining doubts \nmust be resolved against the individual. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required by section \nE3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n\n \n6 \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all available information, it is not clearly consistent with the interests of \nnational security for Applicant to have access to classified information. Applicant\u2019s request \nfor security clearance eligibility is denied. \n \n \n \n                                             \nMATTHEW E. MALONE \nAdministrative Judge \n",

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant, age 46, is married with three minor children and one adult child. He earned his high school diploma in 1991. He took online-college courses between 2010 and 2011, without earning a degree. He served honorably in the U.S. Marine Corps, from 1992 until he retired in July 2012. He has been employed as a software testing engineer by the same defense contractor since then. He has maintained his security clearance since 1992. (Item 2 at 4; Items 3 and 4) Without specifying details about his relevant income and expense history, Applicant asserted that his income decreased with his civilian job and did not suffice to meet his family\u2019s expenses. He had not accounted for how much higher the cost of living would be once he transitioned out of base housing, in which he had lived during the prior 15 years. Between 2013 and 2014, he fell behind with payments to his creditors and then chose to pay living expenses over his other debts. Eventually, he opted to allow those other debts to be sent to collections and charged off rather than resolve them. He received financial counseling and was advised not to file bankruptcy. In June 2018, Applicant declared that his finances were stable and that he was living within his means. He reaffirmed the same in June 2019.

Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nStatement of the Case \nApplicant submitted a security clearance application on June 29, 2017. On May \n24, 2019, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications Facility (DOD CAF) \nsent him a Statement of Reasons (SOR) alleging security concerns under Guideline F. \nThe DOD CAF acted under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, \nDefense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as \namended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) implemented by the DOD on \nJune 8, 2017. \nApplicant answered the SOR on June 25, 2019, and requested a decision on the \nwritten record without a hearing. On August 20, 2019, the Government sent Applicant a \ncomplete copy of its written case, a file of relevant material (FORM), including \ndocuments identified as Items 1 through 6. He was given an opportunity to submit a \ndocumentary response setting forth objections, rebuttal, extenuation, mitigation, or \nexplanation to the Government\u2019s evidence.

Items 1 and 2 contain the pleadings in the case. Items 3 through 6 \nare admitted into evidence. The case was assigned to me on November 5, 2019. \nProcedural Matters \nThe Government included a summary of Applicant\u2019s security clearance interview \n(Item 4) among the evidentiary items in the FORM. It also included a prominent notice \nadvising Applicant of his right to object to the admissibility of Item 4 on the ground that it \nwas not authenticated as required by Directive \u00b6 E3.1.20. The Government did not, \nhowever, advise Applicant of the consequences of his failure to raise an objection to \nItem 4 in his responses to the FORM: specifically, that he could be considered to have \nwaived any such objection; and that Item 4 could be considered as evidence in his \ncase. Applicant did not raise an objection to Item 4 in a FORM response or otherwise. \nHowever, because he was not advised that Item 4 could be considered as evidence \nabsent his objection, Item 4 is admitted only for the limited purpose of considering any \nmitigating or exculpatory information therein. I will not consider any disqualifying or \nderogatory information contained in Item 4 that is not corroborated by admissible \nevidence. \nThe Government included highlighted and bolded language in the first full \nparagraph of page 3 of the FORM, which contains facts that do not relate to this case. It \nappears to be an inadvertent typographical error. I conclude that it is harmless error \ngiven that the facts related to argument and did not affect either the relative positions of \nthe parties or my decision. Nevertheless, I mention it to avoid any confusion in the \nrecord. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant, age 46, is married with three minor children and one adult child. He \nearned his high school diploma in 1991. He took online-college courses between 2010 \nand 2011, without earning a degree. He served honorably in the U.S. Marine Corps, \nfrom 1992 until he retired in July 2012. He has been employed as a software testing \nengineer by the same defense contractor since then. He has maintained his security \nclearance since 1992. (Item 2 at 4; Items 3 and 4) \nWithout specifying details about his relevant income and expense history, \nApplicant asserted that his income decreased with his civilian job and did not suffice to \nmeet his family\u2019s expenses. He had not accounted for how much higher the cost of \nliving would be once he transitioned out of base housing, in which he had lived during \nthe prior 15 years. Between 2013 and 2014, he fell behind with payments to his \ncreditors and then chose to pay living expenses over his other debts. Eventually, he \nopted to allow those other debts to be sent to collections and charged off rather than \nresolve them. He received financial counseling and was advised not to file bankruptcy. \nIn June 2018, Applicant declared that his finances were stable and that he was living \nwithin his means. He reaffirmed the same in June 2019. (Item 2 at 4; Item 3 at 29-33; \nItem 4 at 4) \n2 \n\nThe SOR alleged 24 delinquent accounts, the balances of which totaled \n$106,868, and two delinquent accounts, with no specified balance, consisting primarily \nof credit-card and loan debts in either charged-off or collection status. Applicant \nadmitted to all but one $37 medical account, of which he claimed to have no knowledge. \nThat debt is confirmed by his 2017 credit report. He does not plan to resolve any of his \nadmitted SOR debts based on his belief that they are no longer in delinquent status \nsince they were all reported as charged off and closed on his recent credit report. (Item \n2 at 4; Items 5 and 6) \nApplicant's credit reports reveal a long-standing history of reliance on consumer \ndebt, including the following seven new accounts he opened between 2014 and 2018, \nwhich are currently active and in good standing: \nType \nDate \nOpened \nHigh \nCredit \nMonthly \nPayment \nDec.2018 \nBalance \nAuto loan \nNov. 2014 \n$33,878 \n$746 \n$18,377 \nCharqe acct. \nFeb.2017 \n$3,584 \n$15 \n$3,510 \nAuto loan \nMay 2017 \n$40,000 \n$1,046 \n$35,302 \nFixed-rate loan May 2017 \n$1,956 \n$144 \n$882 \nCredit card \nAuq.2017 \n$391 \n$36 \n$709 \nCharqe acct. \nNov. 2017 \nunknown \n$27 \n$250 \nAuto loan \nMay 2018 \n$42,879 \n$789 \n$39,756 \nDuring that same period, he opened approximately 10 other accounts that have \nsince been either closed or paid, with no outstanding balance. (Item 5 at 4-6; Item 6 at \n9-10, 12, 16-17) \nPolicies \n\"[N]o one has a 'right' to a security clearance.\" (Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988)). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\"control access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\" (Egan at 527). \nThe President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant \napplicants eligibility for access to classified information \"only upon a finding that it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\" (EO 10865 \u00a7 2). \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the AG. These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, \nrecognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge applies these \nguidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person.

Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence.

May 1, 2012) \nApplicant\u2019s unresolved debts totaling $106,868, and his decision not to repay or \notherwise resolve them, establish three disqualifying conditions under this guideline: AG \n\u00b6 19(a) (inability to satisfy debts); AG \u00b6 19(b) (unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless \nof the ability to do so); and AG \u00b6 19(c) (a history of not meeting financial obligations). \nNone of the following potentially applicable mitigating conditions under this \nguideline are established: \nAG \u00b6 20(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not \ncast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \nAG \u00b6 20(b): the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were \nlargely beyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \nAG \u00b6 20(c): the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling \nfor the problem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit \ncredit counseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem \nis being resolved or is under control; and \nAG \u00b6 20(d): the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to \nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nApplicant has not mitigated the Guideline F concerns. He has substantial \ndelinquent debts that remain unresolved, despite being financially stable since at least \nJune 2018. He failed to demonstrate that he acted responsibly to address them, \nparticularly as he continued to open new consumer-debt accounts. The fact that the \ndebts he incurred are in collection or charged-off status does not mean they are no \nlonger delinquent and does not relieve him of the obligation to repay them. Applicant\u2019s \ndecision not to pay or otherwise resolve his delinquent debts demonstrates a \nwillingness to place his own self-interest above his obligations. I am, therefore, left with \ndoubt as to whether he may also act similarly in the context of his security obligations. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nWhole-Person Analysis \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether the granting or continuing \nof national security eligibility is clearly consistent with the interests of national security \nmust be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful consideration of the \nadjudicative guidelines, each of which is to be evaluated in the context of the whole \nperson. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process factors \nlisted at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nI have incorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-person \nanalysis, and I have considered the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). After weighing the disqualifying \nand mitigating conditions under Guideline F, and evaluating all the evidence in the \ncontext of the whole person, I conclude that Applicant has not mitigated security \nconcerns raised by his unresolved delinquent debts totaling $106,868. Accordingly, \nApplicant has not carried his burden of showing that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant him eligibility for access to classified information. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required by Section \nE3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.z: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant \nApplicant eligibility for access to classified information.

On \nJuly 17, 2019, the Department of Defense (DOD) sent him a Statement of Reasons \n(SOR), alleging security concerns under Guidelines E, F, and J. The DOD acted under \nExecutive Order (E.O.) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry \n(February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel \nSecurity Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the \nadjudicative guidelines (AG) implemented by DOD on June 8, 2017.  \nApplicant answered the SOR July 24, 2019, and requested a decision on the \nrecord without a hearing.

Applicant was given an opportunity to provide \nadditional documents or corroborate any disputes, but she failed to do so. (Item 4) \n \nApplicant admitted that she failed to timely file her 2015 through 2018 Federal and \nstate income tax returns. (Item 3-4) She stated that she did not have the funds to file and \npay taxes due for those years, as she had other financial obligations to pay.

See ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \n \n \nThe record evidence establishes three disqualifying conditions under this \nguideline: AG \u00b6 19(a) (\u201cinability to satisfy debts\u201d), AG \u00b6 19(c) (\u201ca history of not meeting \nfinancial obligations\u201d) and AG 19(f) (\u201cfailure to file or fraudulently file annual Federal, state, \nor local income tax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state or local income tax \nreturns as required\u201d).  \n \nApplicant admitted and her credit reports confirm that she owes $64,000 in \ndelinquent debts and has not filed her Federal or state income tax returns for tax years \n2015-2018. She has failed to pay or otherwise resolve these debts. She states that she \nintends to pay the accounts or dispute them. However, she has taken no action to \nresponsibly dispute or address these delinquent accounts.  She admitted that she will \nobtain a tax preparer to resolve the income tax return issues, but she is not sure when \nthat might occur. None of the mitigating conditions apply. \n \nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct \n \nThe concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 30:  \n \nCriminal activity creates doubt about a person's judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person's ability or \nwillingness to comply with laws, rules and regulations.  \n \nThe following disqualifying conditions apply under this guideline:  \n \nAG \u00b6 31(a): a pattern of minor offenses, any one of which on its own would \nbe unlikely to affect a national security eligibility decision, but which in \ncombination cast doubt on the individual\u2019s judgment, reliability, or \ntrustworthiness; and \n \nAG \u00b6 31(b): evidence . . . of criminal conduct, regardless of whether the \nperson was formally charged, formally prosecuted, or convicted. \nThe following mitigating conditions are potentially applicable: \n \nAG \u00b6 32(a): so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior \nhappened, or it happened under such unusual circumstances, that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; and \n \nAG \u00b6 32(d): there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including but not \nlimited to the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, \nrestitution, compliance with the terms of parole or probation, job training or \nhigher education, good employment record, or constructive community \ninvolvement. \n\n \n \n6\n \nApplicant\u2019s most recent charges were for a DWI in 2018. She was found guilty and \nplaced on probation until at least July 2020. In 2011 and 2012 she was arrested for \nmarijuana possession and reckless handling of a firearm (felony) with destruction of \nproperty.  This pattern of criminal violations since 2011 casts doubt about Applicant\u2019s \nreliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. It further negates evidence of successful \nrehabilitation. None of the mitigating conditions apply. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-\nperson concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process \nfactors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a).  \n \n \nI have considered the factors in AG \u00b6 2(a) and incorporated my comments under \nGuidelines F, and J in my whole-person analysis. After weighing the disqualifying and \nmitigating conditions under Guidelines F, and J, and evaluating all the evidence in the \ncontext of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has not mitigated the security concerns \nraised by her conduct.  She provided no arguments or evidence of mitigation. Accordingly, \nI conclude she has not carried her burden of showing that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant her eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nFormal Findings \n \nAs required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, I make the following \nformal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F (Financial Considerations): AGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.hh:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline J (Criminal Conduct) \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 2.a - 2.d:   \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n7\nConclusion \n \n \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance.

Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \nHistory of the Case \n \nApplicant submitted security clearance applications (SCA) on September 8, 2010 \nand February 5, 2016. On May 24, 2019, the Department of Defense (DOD) issued a \nStatement of Reasons (SOR) alleging security concerns under Guidelines G (Alcohol \nConsumption and J (Criminal Conduct). Applicant answered the SOR on June 14, 2019, \nand requested a hearing before an administrative judge (Answer). The Government was \nready to proceed on August 5, 2019, and the case was assigned to me on August 9, \n2019. On August 22, 2019, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) \nnotified Applicant that the hearing was scheduled for September 26, 2019, and I \nconvened the hearing as scheduled. Government Exhibits (GE) 1 through 8 were \nadmitted without objection, and Applicant testified. I received the completed transcript \n(Tr.) on October 11, 2019, and the record closed.  \n \n \n\n \n2 \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant, 47, is married, and has two minor children. He received a bachelor\u2019s \ndegree in 2000. He served in the U.S. Navy from 1994 until 2007, and was separated \nwith a General Discharge. He has held a security clearance for almost 25 years, and he \ncurrently holds a top secret clearance with sensitive compartmented information access \n(TS/SCI). He has worked for a defense contractor since he left the Navy, and he has \nbeen a capture manager since January 2019. (GE 1; GE 2; Tr. 9-13) \n \n \nIn 1994, while on active duty, Applicant was arrested and charged with driving \nwhile intoxicated (DWI). He held a TS/SCI security clearance at the time of the incident. \nApplicant does not remember the amount of alcohol he consumed or his blood alcohol \ncontent (BAC) level, but he remembers failing the field sobriety tests. He pled no \ncontest to the charges and received fines. (GE 6 at 6; Tr. 12, 26-30) \n \n \nIn January 2009, Applicant was arrested and charged with DWI. He had been \ndrinking at home with a friend and decided to run an errand. During his drive home, he \nwas pulled over for speeding. He was required to take field sobriety tests and his BAC \nlevel was .15 percent. He plead guilty to the reduced charge of reckless driving. \nApplicant was sentenced to six months of probation, his license was restricted for six \nmonths, he was ordered to pay a $500 fine and court costs, attend an alcohol safety \naction program (ASAP), and a ten-week alcohol-related class. In ASAP, Applicant was \nnot diagnosed with an alcohol use disorder. At the time of this incident he held a TS/SCI \nsecurity clearance. (GE 1 at 27; GE 2 at 47; GE 3 at 1-2; GE 5; Tr. 32-40) \n \nAt the time of the 2009 arrest, Applicant consumed two to three alcoholic drinks \ntwice a month. After the arrest, he reported the incident to his facility security officer \n(FSO) and abstained from alcohol for two to three years. Applicant admittedly did not \ntake the 2009 arrest seriously enough and only made the changes that were required \ndue to the court requirements. (Tr. 40-44, 53-54)  \n \nIn August 2018, Applicant was arrested and charged with DWI and refusal of \nblood or breath test. Applicant\u2019s wife and children were not home at the time of this \nincident. He testified that he was driving to his home at about 11:00 at night after \nrunning an errand. While he was attempting to use his car\u2019s hands-free system, he \ndrifted into a parked car in his neighborhood. The owner of the vehicle was home and \nwitnessed the incident. The owner of the vehicle and Applicant exchanged words, and \nthe situation escalated. When he left the scene of the accident to drive home, he was \naware the woman intended to call the police. (GE 3 at 2-3; GE 7; Tr. 45-48, 61-62) \n \nAccording to Applicant, he did not consume any alcohol prior to the incident. \nAfter he arrived home, he consumed two large beers to calm his nerves. The police \narrived at Applicant\u2019s home within 15 minutes, and the police officer could smell alcohol \non Applicant. Applicant refused to take field sobriety tests and a breathalyzer; therefore, \nhe was arrested and taken to jail. The next day when he was released, Applicant \ncontacted his FSO and reported the incident. Upon advice from his attorney, he pled \nguilty to DWI, and as a result, the refusal charge was dismissed. Applicant was ordered \n\n \n3 \n \nto pay a $250 fine and $216 court costs. He was required to have an interlock device \ninstalled in his vehicle for six months and attend an ASAP class. Finally, his license was \nrestricted for a year from January 9, 2019. All the terms of this conviction were satisfied, \nbut his license remains restricted. (GE 3 at 2-3; GE 4; GE 7; GE 8; Tr. 48-53, 63-67) \n \nAt the time of the August 2018 DWI arrest, Applicant was unhappy at work, which \nwas causing stress in his personal life. He admittedly used alcohol to cope with his \nunhappiness, and at the hearing he described his prior alcohol consumption as \n\u201cmaladaptive\u201d. The last time Applicant consumed alcohol was the night of his August \n2018 arrest. (Tr. 51-57, 68) \n \nApplicant provided several letters of recommendation in his Answer to the SOR. \nHe is described as a dedicated family man, professional, and trustworthy. In his 2017 \nand 2018 performance evaluations, his work and management was described him as \naccountable, available, responsive, professional, successful, and compliant. Applicant is \nheavily involved with coaching his sons\u2019 baseball teams. (Answer; Tr. 56, 60) \n \nPolicies \n \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG), which became \neffective on June 8, 2017. \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \n\n \n4 \n \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline G: Alcohol Consumption \n \nAG \u00b6 21 expresses the security concern pertaining to alcohol consumption: \nExcessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable \njudgment or the failure to control impulses, and can raise questions about \nan individual's reliability and trustworthiness. \nApplicant\u2019s \nadmissions \nand \nthe \ndocumentary \nevidence \nestablish \none \ndisqualifying condition under AG \u00b6 22: \n(a) alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while under \nthe influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or \nother incidents of concern, regardless of whether the individual is \ndiagnosed as an alcohol abuser or alcohol dependent. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 23 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns raised under \nthis guideline. Two are potentially applicable: \n \n(a) so much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, \nor good judgment; and \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her pattern of maladaptive alcohol \nuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and \n\n \n5 \n \nestablished a pattern of modified consumption or abstinence in \naccordance with treatment recommendations.  \n \nApplicant had three alcohol-related incidents between 1994 and August 2018. All \nof the arrests were for driving a vehicle while intoxicated, and they occurred while he \nheld a security clearance. Applicant denied consuming alcohol prior to the August 2018 \nincident, and claimed he drank two beers in the fifteen-minute period between arriving \nhome and the policeman\u2019s arrival to question him. Given his history of DWIs while \nholding a clearance, his claims lack credibility and are self-serving. Additionally, his \ntestimony that he drank beer to calm his nerves belies a reliance on alcohol that he did \nnot acknowledge. Regardless of whether Applicant consumed alcohol before or after he \nhit a parked vehicle with his car, the subsequent passage of time since the incident is \ninsufficient to mitigate the underlying concerns.  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s abstinence since August 2018 is not sufficient to mitigate his behavior \ngiven his history of alcohol-related incidents while holding a security clearance. \nAlthough, Applicant was not diagnosed with an alcohol-related disorder, he did not seek \ncounseling or treatment after the DUI arrests beyond his court-ordered classes and \nprograms. AG \u00b6\u00b6 23(a) and 23(b) do not apply.  \n \nGuideline J: Criminal Conduct \n \nAG \u00b6 30 expresses the security concerns pertaining to criminal conduct: \n \nCriminal activity creates doubt about a person's judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person's ability \nor willingness to comply with laws, rules and regulations. \n \nAG \u00b6 31 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. Two are potentially applicable in this case: \n \n(a) a pattern of minor offenses, any one of which on its own would be \nunlikely to affect a national security eligibility decision, but which in \ncombination cast doubt on the individual's judgment, reliability, or \ntrustworthiness; and \n \n(b) evidence (including, but not limited to, a credible allegation, an \nadmission, and matters of official record) of criminal conduct, regardless of \nwhether the individual was formally charged, prosecuted, or convicted. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s three arrests between 1994 and 2018 establish the above conditions. \nAG \u00b6 32 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns raised in this case. \nThe following two are potentially applicable: \n \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur \n\n \n6 \n \nand does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, trustworthiness, or \ngood judgment; and \n \n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including, but not limited \nto, the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, restitution, \ncompliance with the terms of parole or probation, job training or higher \neducation, \ngood \nemployment \nrecord, \nor \nconstructive \ncommunity \ninvolvement. \n \n \nIt has been only about 14 months since Applicant\u2019s last DWI arrest and less than \na year since his conviction. His license remains restricted. Applicant\u2019s history of DWI \narrests, while holding a security clearance, indicate a failure to follow rules and \nregulations, and demonstrate a lack of responsible behavior. Given the seriousness of \nthe convictions and the ongoing nature of his restricted license, mitigation under AG \u00b6\u00b6 \n32(a) and 32(d) is not established. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the \npotentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and \ncircumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuidelines G and J in my whole-person analysis. I also considered Applicant\u2019s favorable \ncharacter evidence. \n \n \nApplicant has not carried his burden of showing that it is clearly consistent with \nthe national security interests of the United States to grant him eligibility for access to \nclassified information. \n \n \n \n \n\n \n7 \n \nFormal Findings  \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:  \n \nParagraph 1, Alcohol Consumption:  \n \n \nAGAINST Applicant \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.c:   \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nParagraph 2, Criminal Conduct:  \n \n \nAGAINST Applicant \n \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \n \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the interests of national security of \nthe United States to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified \ninformation.

On August 15, \n2019, the case was assigned to me. On September 11, 2019, DOHA issued a notice of \nhearing, setting the hearing for September 26, 2019. (HE 1) The hearing was held as \nscheduled. \n \nDuring the hearing, Department Counsel offered seven exhibits; Applicant offered \nnine exhibits; there were no objections; and all proffered exhibits were admitted into \nevidence. (Tr. 18-21; GE 1-7; Applicant Exhibit (AE) A-AE I) On October 11, 2019, DOHA \nreceived a transcript of the hearing.  \n \nSome details were excluded to protect Applicant\u2019s right to privacy. Specific \ninformation is available in the cited exhibits. All tax-related amounts are rounded to the \nnearest thousand if equal to or over $1,000, and to nearest $100 if below $1,000.  \n \nProcedural Issue \n \nDepartment Counsel moved to withdraw SOR \u00b6 1.g. (Tr. 13) Applicant did not \nobject, and I granted Department Counsel\u2019s motion. (Tr. 14)    \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn Applicant\u2019s SOR responses, he admitted the SOR allegations in \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through \n1.d, and he denied SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.e through 1.g. (HE 3) He also provided extenuating and \nmitigating information. (HE 3) His admissions are accepted as findings of fact.   \n \nApplicant is a 40-year-old information security consultant who has worked for his \ncurrent defense-contractor employer for four years. (Tr. 7-8, 22) In 1998, he graduated \nfrom high school, and he attended college; however, he did not receive a degree. (Tr. 7, \n22) He has no military service. (Tr. 7, 23) He was married from 2002 to 2008, and he \nmarried again in 2016. (Tr. 8, 30; GE 1) He has two children ages 2 and 14 and three step \nchildren ages 15, 19, and 21. (Tr. 9, 30-31) He has not had any unemployment in the \nprevious five years. (Tr. 8) He is not required to pay any child support. (Tr. 9)  \n \nFinancial Considerations \n \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b allege Applicant failed to timely file his federal income tax return \nfor tax year 2015 and his state tax return for tax year 2015. Applicant prepared his 2015 \nfederal income tax return; however, he did not mail it to the IRS. (Tr. 33-34) He lost track \nof his 2015 federal income tax return on his cluttered desk. (Tr. 33) His work schedule was \ndemanding and hectic, and he did not give a high-enough priority to getting his 2015 tax \nreturns filed. (Tr. 33-34) He mostly attributed the failure to file his 2015 federal income tax \nreturn to an oversight. (Tr. 38) According to his 2015 federal income tax return, he owes \nthe IRS $14,000. (Tr. 35-36; AE B) He plans to file the 2015 federal income tax return \nsoon. (Tr. 39) He did not timely file his federal income tax returns for tax years 2011 \n\n \n3 \n                                        \n \nthrough 2018, although several of those years could have been filed within the extension \nperiods. (Tr. 44) His state tax returns for those same years were not timely filed. (Tr. 44-\n45)   \n   \nSOR \u00b6 1.c alleges Applicant owes federal income taxes of about $6,000 for tax year \n2016. He acknowledged that he owed the tax debt for tax year 2016. (Tr. 33, 36) He did \nnot resolve his federal tax debt for five reasons: (1) procrastination; (2) busy with heavy \ndemands from work; (3) family issues; (4) use of funds for travel; and (5) payments of 25 \npercent of his income to address his state income tax debt. (Tr. 37-39) The family issues \ninvolved custody of his daughter and taking his children to sporting events. (Tr. 38) In \nSeptember 2019, he completed an online payment agreement with the IRS relating to his \n2011 to 2016 federal income taxes. (Tr. 40-41; AE D) He estimated his federal tax debt to \nbe about $35,000 including tax year 2015. (Tr. 41-42) His first payment of $521 was made \nto the IRS in September 2019 under his payment plan. (Tr. 36, 42-43)  \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.d alleges Applicant owes state taxes of about $9,000. From 2012 to 2018, \nthe state tax authority filed six tax liens against Applicant. (Tr. 49) Applicant had a wage \ngarnishment to collect a $47,000 state tax debt. (Tr. 46) All of Applicant\u2019s state income \ntaxes are now paid. (Tr. 45, 48-51; AE E) He believed he filed his state income tax return \nfor tax year 2015. (Tr. 45-46; AE C) \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.e alleges Applicant has a past-due vehicle financing debt for $1,255. One \nof Applicant\u2019s payments was returned for insufficient funds, and the creditor reported the \ndebt as past due. (Tr. 58) The debt is now current. (Tr. 58-59; AE G) \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.f alleges Applicant has a charged-off account for $1,285. Applicant rented \nfurniture in 2010, and the most recent payment was in 2011. (Tr. 59-60) Applicant \ncontacted the creditor, and the creditor was unable to locate the debt. (Tr. 59-60) The \naccount is closed. (Tr. 59-60)   \n \nApplicant\u2019s current annual base salary is about $200,000 with a potential $30,000 \nbonus. (Tr. 26-27) Applicant is current on his student loan payments. (Tr. 23) He has not \nhad any financial counseling. (Tr. 61) Now that the state-wage garnishment is complete, \nhe has the available funds to maintain currency on his debt and to establish and complete \nan IRS payment plan. (Tr. 65) He has been entrusted with sensitive information during \nhis career, and he has conscientiously protected the information. (Tr. 64-65)   \n \nTwo coworkers who have known Applicant for five to seven years positively \ndescribed Applicant work performance and character. (AE I) He is an honest, diligent, \nprofessional who makes significant contributions to his employers. (AE I) \n \n \nPolicies \n \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the Executive \nBranch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security emphasizing, \n\u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. \n518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to control \n\n \n4 \n                                        \n \naccess to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual \nis sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The President \nhas authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicant\u2019s eligibility for \naccess to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865. \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable.  \n \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nabout potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Clearance \ndecisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a \ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 7. \nThus, nothing in this decision should be construed to suggest that it is based, in whole or \nin part, on any express or implied determination about applicant\u2019s allegiance, loyalty, or \npatriotism. It is merely an indication the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the \nPresident, Secretary of Defense, and DNI have established for issuing a clearance. \n \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 at 2 \n(App. Bd. May 2, 1996). \n \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it \nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d \nISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). The burden of disproving a \nmitigating condition never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 \n(App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if they must, \non the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b). \n \n \n \n\n \n5 \n                                        \n \nAnalysis \n \nFinancial Considerations \n \nAG \u00b6 18 articulates the security concern for financial problems: \n \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. . . . An individual who is financially \noverextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or otherwise \nquestionable acts to generate funds. . . . \n \nThe Appeal Board explained the scope and rationale for the financial \nconsiderations security concern in ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012) \n(citation omitted) as follows: \n \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an applicant might \nknowingly compromise classified information in order to raise money in \nsatisfaction of his or her debts. Rather, it requires a Judge to examine the \ntotality of an applicant\u2019s financial history and circumstances. The Judge \nmust consider pertinent evidence regarding the applicant\u2019s self-control, \njudgment, and other qualities essential to protecting the national secrets as \nwell as the vulnerabilities inherent in the circumstances. The Directive \npresumes a nexus between proven conduct under any of the Guidelines \nand an applicant\u2019s security eligibility.  \n \n  \nAG \u00b6 19 includes disqualifying conditions that could raise a security concern and \nmay be disqualifying in this case: \u201c(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the \nability to do so\u201d; \u201c(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations\u201d; and \u201c(f) failure to file \nor fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income tax returns or failure to pay \nannual Federal, state, or local income tax as required.\u201d The record establishes AG \u00b6\u00b6 \n19(b), 19(c), and 19(f).  \n \nAG \u00b6 20 lists financial considerations mitigating conditions which may be applicable \nin this case:  \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n\n \n6 \n                                        \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control;  \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts;   \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue;  \n \n(f) the affluence resulted from a legal source of income; and \n \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority \nto file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \n \nThe DOHA Appeal Board concisely explained Applicant\u2019s responsibility for proving \nthe applicability of mitigating conditions as follows:  \n \nOnce a concern arises regarding an Applicant\u2019s security clearance \neligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance of \na security clearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th \nCir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991). After the Government \npresents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the \napplicant to rebut or mitigate those concerns. See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. The \nstandard applicable in security clearance decisions is that articulated in \nEgan, supra. \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access \nto classified information will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nDirective, Enclosure 2 \u00b6 2(b).  \n \nISCR Case No. 10-04641 at 4 (App. Bd. Sept. 24, 2013).  \n \nThe SOR alleges and the record establishes that Applicant failed to timely file when \ndue his state and federal income tax returns for tax year 2015. He has a federal income \ntax debt of about $35,000. His reasons for not timely filing his 2015 federal and state \nincome tax returns are not sufficient to excuse his failure to timely file these documents.  \n \nA willful failure to timely make (means complete and file with the IRS) a federal \nincome tax return is a misdemeanor-level federal criminal offense. Title 26 U.S.C, \u00a7 7203, \nwillful failure to file return, supply information, or pay tax, reads:  \n \nAny person . . . required by this title or by regulations made under authority \nthereof to make a return, keep any records, or supply any information, who \nwillfully fails to . . .  make such return, keep such records, or supply such \n\n \n7 \n                                        \n \ninformation, at the time or times required by law or regulations, shall, in \naddition to other penalties provided by law, be guilty of a misdemeanor . . . .  \n \nA willful failure to make return, keep records, or supply information when required, \nis a misdemeanor without regard to existence of any tax liability. Spies v. United States, \n317 U.S. 492 (1943); United States v. Walker, 479 F.2d 407 (9th Cir. 1973); United States \nv. McCabe, 416 F.2d 957 (7th Cir. 1969); O\u2019Brien v. United States, 51 F.2d 193 (7th Cir. \n1931). For purposes of this decision, I am not weighing Applicant\u2019s failure to timely file his \nfederal income tax returns against him as a federal crime. \n \nApplicant\u2019s SOR does not allege he failed to timely file when due his federal and \nstate income tax returns for tax years 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014, 2016, 2017, and 2018. His \nSOR does not allege that he owed delinquent federal income taxes for several of those \nyears, and his federal tax debt now totals about $35,000. In ISCR Case No. 03-20327 at \n4 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, 2006), the Appeal Board listed five circumstances in which conduct \nnot alleged in an SOR may be considered stating:  \n \n(a) to assess an applicant\u2019s credibility; (b) to evaluate an applicant\u2019s \nevidence of extenuation, mitigation, or changed circumstances; (c) to \nconsider whether an applicant has demonstrated successful rehabilitation;  \n(d) to decide whether a particular provision of the Adjudicative Guidelines is \napplicable; or (e) to provide evidence for whole person analysis under \nDirective Section 6.3.  \n \nId. (citing ISCR Case No. 02-07218 at 3 (App. Bd. Mar. 15, 2004); ISCR Case No. 00-\n0633 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct. 24, 2003)). See also ISCR Case No. 12-09719 at 3 (App. Bd. \nApr. 6, 2016) (citing ISCR Case No. 14-00151 at 3, n. 1 (App. Bd. Sept. 12, 2014); ISCR \nCase No. 03-20327 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, 2006)). The non-SOR allegations will not be \nconsidered except for the five purposes listed above.  \n \nApplicant has taken an important step towards showing his financial responsibility. \nApplicant filed all required tax returns, except for his 2015 federal income tax return; his \nstate tax debt is paid; and his federal income tax debt is in a payment plan. He assured \nhe will timely file all future tax returns and pay his federal income tax debt.  \n \nIn ISCR Case No. 15-01031 at 2 (App. Bd. June 15, 2016), the Appeal Board \nreversed the grant of a security clearance, and noted the following primary relevant \ndisqualifying facts:  \n \nApplicant filed his 2011 Federal income tax return in December 2013 and \nreceived a $2,074 tax refund. He filed his 2012 Federal tax return in \nSeptember 2014 and his 2013 Federal tax return in October 2015. He \nreceived Federal tax refunds of $3,664 for 2012 and $1,013 for 2013. \n \nEven if no taxes are owed when tax returns are filed, the Appeal Board provided the \nfollowing principal rationale for reversing the grant of a security clearance: \n \n\n \n8 \n                                        \n \nFailure to comply with Federal and/or state tax laws suggests that an \napplicant has a problem with abiding by well-established Government rules \nand regulations. Voluntary compliance with rules and regulations is \nessential for protecting classified information.  .  .  .  By failing to file his \n2011, 2012, and 2013 Federal income tax returns in a timely manner, [that \napplicant] did not demonstrate the high degree of good judgment and \nreliability required of persons granted access to classified information.  \n \nISCR Case No. 15-01031 at 4 (App. Bd. June 15, 2016) (citations omitted). AG \u00b6 20(g) \napplies in part because he filed his tax returns and paid some of his required taxes; \nhowever, the timing of the filing of his tax returns is an important aspect of the analysis. \nIn ISCR Case No. 15-06440 at 4 (App. Bd. Dec. 26, 2017) the Appeal Board reversed the \ngrant of a security clearance, discussed how AG \u00b6 20(g) applied, and noted: \n \nThe timing of the resolution of financial problems is an important factor in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s case for mitigation because an applicant who \nbegins to resolve financial problems only after being placed on notice that \nhis clearance was in jeopardy may lack the judgment and self-discipline to \nfollow rules and regulations over time or when there is no immediate threat \nto his own interests. In this case, Applicant\u2019s filing of his Federal income tax \nreturns for 2009-2014 after submitting his SCA, undergoing his background \ninterview, or receiving the SOR undercuts the weight such remedial action \nmight otherwise merit. \n \nIn sum, Applicant failed to timely file his federal and state tax returns for tax years \n2011 through 2018. He has not made enough payments under his federal income tax \npayment plan to mitigate his federal income tax debt of about $35,000. Applicant failed to \nestablish mitigation of financial considerations security concerns.  \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), \u201c[t]he ultimate determination\u201d of whether to grant a security \nclearance \u201cmust be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \n\n \n9 \n                                        \n \nof the guidelines\u201d and the whole-person concept. My comments under Guideline F are \nincorporated in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were \naddressed under that guideline but some warrant additional comment. \n \nApplicant is a 40-year-old information security consultant who has worked for his \ncurrent defense-contractor employer for four years. In 1998, he graduated from high \nschool, and he attended college; however, he did not receive a degree. He has not had \nany unemployment in the previous five years.  Two coworkers described Applicant as an \nhonest, diligent, and professional employee who makes significant contributions to his \nemployers.   \n \nApplicant failed to timely file his federal and state tax returns for tax years 2011 \nthrough 2018. He has not made enough payments under his federal payment plan to \nmitigate his federal income tax debt. He has had delinquent federal or state income taxes \nfor several years. In 2019, he paid his state tax debt, and he is currently making payments \nto address his federal income tax debt. \n \nThe Appeal Board\u2019s emphasis on security concerns arising from tax cases is \ninstructive and binding on administrative judges. See ISCR Case No. 14-05794 at 7 (App. \nBd. July 7, 2016) (reversing grant of security clearance and stating, \u201cHis delay in taking \naction to resolve his tax deficiency for years and then taking action only after his security \nclearance was in jeopardy undercuts a determination that Applicant has rehabilitated \nhimself and does not reflect the voluntary compliance of rules and regulations expected \nof someone entrusted with the nation\u2019s secrets.\u201d); ISCR Case No. 14-01894 at 2-6 (App. \nBd. Aug. 18, 2015) (reversing grant of a security clearance, discussing lack of detailed \ncorroboration of circumstances beyond applicant\u2019s control adversely affecting finances, \nnoting two tax liens totaling $175,000 and garnishment of Applicant\u2019s wages, and \nemphasizing the applicant\u2019s failure to timely file and pay taxes); ISCR Case No. 12-05053 \nat 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 30, 2014) (reversing grant of a security clearance, noting not all tax \nreturns filed, and insufficient discussion of Applicant\u2019s efforts to resolve tax liens).  \n \nMore recently, in ISCR Case No. 14-05476 (App. Bd. Mar. 25, 2016) the Appeal \nBoard reversed a grant of a security clearance for a retired E-9 and cited his failure to \ntimely file state tax returns for tax years 2010 through 2013 and federal returns for tax \nyears 2010 through 2012. Before the retired E-9\u2019s hearing, he filed his tax returns and \npaid his tax debts except for $13,000, which was in an established payment plan. The \nAppeal Board highlighted his annual income of over $200,000 and discounted his non-\ntax expenses, contributions to DOD, expenditures for his children\u2019s college tuition and \nexpenses, and spouse\u2019s serious medical and mental health problems. The Appeal Board \nemphasized \u201cthe allegations regarding his failure to file tax returns in the first place stating, \nit is well settled that failure to file tax returns suggest that an applicant has a problem with \ncomplying with well-established government rules and systems. Voluntary compliance \nwith such rules and systems is essential for protecting classified information.\u201d Id. at 5 \n(citing ISCR Case No. 01-05340 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 20, 2002) (internal quotation marks \nand brackets omitted)). See also ISCR Case No. 14-03358 at 3, 5 (App. Bd. Oct. 9, 2015) \n(reversing grant of a security clearance, noting $150,000 owed to the federal government, \nand stating \u201cA security clearance represents an obligation to the Federal Government for \n\n \n10 \n                                        \n \nthe protection of national secrets. Accordingly failure to honor other obligations to the \nGovernment has a direct bearing on an applicant\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability \nto protect classified information.\u201d).  \n \nThe primary problem here relates to Applicant\u2019s handling of his federal and state \nincome taxes. Applicant knew that he needed to timely file his federal and state income \ntax returns. He had a legal requirement to timely file his tax returns and pay his taxes. His \nactions under the Appeal Board jurisprudence are too little, too late to fully mitigate \nsecurity concerns. Applicant\u2019s failure to \u201csatisfy debts, and meet financial obligations may \nindicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and \nregulations, all of which can raise questions about [his] reliability, trustworthiness, and \nability to protect classified or sensitive information.\u201d AG \u00b6 16. \n \nIt is well settled that once a concern arises regarding an applicant\u2019s security \nclearance eligibility, there is a strong presumption against granting a security clearance. \nSee Dorfmont, 913 F. 2d at 1401. I have carefully applied the law, as set forth in Egan, \nExec. Or. 10865, the Directive, the AGs, and the Appeal Board\u2019s jurisprudence to the \nfacts and circumstances in the context of the whole person. Unmitigated financial \nconsiderations security concerns lead me to conclude that grant of a security clearance \nto Applicant is not warranted at this time.   \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n  \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT  \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a, 1.b, and 1.c: \n  \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.d, 1.e, and 1.f: \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.g: \n \n \n \nWithdrawn \n \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s \neligibility for a security clearance.

Eligibility for a security clearance is denied. \nStatement of the Case \nOn April 3, 2018, Applicant applied for a security clearance and submitted an \nElectronic Questionnaires for Investigations Processing (e-QIP) version of a Security \nClearance Application. On May 24, 2019, the Department of Defense (DOD) \nConsolidated Adjudications Facility (CAF) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to him, \nunder Executive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \nIndustry (February 20, 1960), as amended and modified; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense \nIndustrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended \nand modified (Directive); and Directive 4 of the Security Executive Agent (SEAD 4), \nNational Security Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) (December 10, 2016), for all covered \nindividuals who require initial or continued eligibility for access to classified information or \neligibility to hold a sensitive position, effective June 8, 2017. \n\n \n2 \n                                      \n \n The SOR alleged security concerns under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) \nand detailed reasons why the DOD adjudicators were unable to find that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant. \nThe SOR recommended referral to an administrative judge to determine whether a \nclearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked.  \n \n \nIn a sworn statement, dated June 14, 2019, Applicant responded to the SOR, and \nhe elected to have his case decided on the written record in lieu of a hearing. A complete \ncopy of the Government\u2019s file of relevant material (FORM) was mailed to Applicant by the \nDefense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) on July 12, 2019, and he was afforded \nan opportunity after receipt of the FORM to file objections and submit material in \nrefutation, extenuation, or mitigation. In addition to the FORM, Applicant was furnished a \ncopy of the Directive as well as the Adjudicative Guidelines applicable to his case. \nApplicant received the FORM on July 19, 2019. Applicant responded to the FORM by \ntimely submitting some financial documents, all of which were accepted without objection. \nThe case was assigned to me on September 16, 2019.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nIn his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted, with brief comments, nearly all, or \nparts thereof, of the factual allegations pertaining to financial considerations in the SOR \n(SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c. through 1.k.). Applicant\u2019s admissions and comments are incorporated herein \nas findings of fact. After a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, \nand upon due consideration of same, I make the following additional findings of fact:  \n \nApplicant is a 41-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has been serving \nas an associate systems administrator with his current employer since September 2016. \nHe is a 1996 high school graduate. He enlisted in the U.S. Army in November 1996, and \nhe remained on active duty, including service in both Iraq and Afghanistan, until he was \nhonorably retired in December 2016. He was treated for post-traumatic stress disorder \n(PTSD) in 2014. He was granted a secret clearance in 1996, and he reported that he was \ngranted access to sensitive compartmented information (SCI) in 2012. He was married in \n1999, and divorced in 2002. He remarried in 2004, and divorced in 2011.  He remarried \nin 2011, and, after a separation of over one year, he was divorced in July 2019. He has \ntwo children, born in 2000 and 2005.  \n \nFinancial Considerations \n \nGeneral source information pertaining to the financial accounts discussed below \ncan be found in the following exhibits: Item 5 (Combined Experian and TransUnion Credit \nReport, dated May 10, 2018); Item 6 (Equifax Credit Report, dated May 6, 2019); Item 3 \n(e-QIP, dated April 3, 2018); Item 4 (Enhanced Subject Interview, dated June 1, 2018); \nand Item 2 (Applicant\u2019s Answer to SOR, dated June 14, 2019).  \nApplicant attributed his financial difficulties to his most recent separation and \ndivorce, as well as contending that his ex-wife generated some bills in his name for her \nown children who were merely Applicant\u2019s former step-children. (Item 3, at 46-51) \n\n \n3 \n                                      \n \nBecause of the loss of his ex-wife\u2019s income, Applicant did not generate sufficient funds to \nmaintain his financial accounts, and many of them became delinquent. Insufficient funds \napparently did not stop Applicant from what might be construed as frivolous or \nirresponsible spending, for in January 2019 \u2013 six months after his OPM interview \u2013 \nApplicant purchased his third automobile for $34,000 with a monthly payment of $686. \nHe already had two other cars with monthly payments of $866 and $544, as well as a \nmotorcycle with a $579 monthly payment. (Item 6, at 2-6) Some of the delinquent \naccounts were charged off, and some were sold or transferred to debt purchasers. He \nreportedly engaged the services of a national law firm to assist him in improving his credit, \nbut he failed to submit any documentation to support his claim, and he failed to describe \nwhat specific services they were to furnish him. (Item 3, at 46; Item4, at 7) \nWhen Applicant completed his April 2018 e-QIP, he acknowledged having four \ndelinquent accounts. (Item 3, at 47-51) In June 2018, during his interview with an \ninvestigator from the U.S. Office of Personnel Management (OPM), Applicant discussed \nhis four delinquent accounts. It was only after he was confronted with additional \ndelinquent accounts that he shared the facts associated with those accounts, and stated \nthat he was unaware that they were delinquent. (Item 4, at 9) \nThe SOR alleged 13 delinquent accounts totaling approximately $21,395. \nApplicant described his repayment plans by claiming that he prioritizes his debts and pays \ncertain \u201cnecessary\u201d debts first. He also stated that he was willing to sell his house to \ngenerate the equity in the home to pay off his remaining debt. (Item 4, at 9) Regarding \nthose accounts for which he had not yet taken any steps to resolve, Applicant indicated \nin June 2019 that he was working to set up repayment plans, or otherwise get them \nresolved. (Item 2, at 1-2) The SOR allegations are set forth below: \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a. and 1.b.: These are two medical accounts with unpaid balances of \n$101 and $103 that were placed for collection. (Item 5, at 12; Item 6, at 1-2) Applicant \ncontended that his ex-wife used Applicant\u2019s health coverage for her two children \u2013 \nApplicant\u2019s former step children \u2013 and that he was working to get those charges removed. \n(Item 2, at 1; Item 4, at 8) He failed to submit documentation such as correspondence \nwith his health insurer or the creditor to support his contention. In the absence of such \ndocumentation, I conclude that the accounts are not yet in the process of being resolved. \nSOR \u00b6 1.c.: This is a bank-issued charge account with a $1,900 credit limit and a \npast-due balance of $2,479 that was charged off. The account was subsequently sold to \na debt purchaser. (Item 5, at 13; Item 6, at 2, 7) Applicant admitted that he is indebted to \nthe creditor, but contended that he has been making agreed-upon unspecified \u201cpayments \nthrough company.\u201d (Item 2, at 2) He submitted a payment plan calling for 31 monthly \npayments of $75.11, commencing on July 1, 2019 \u2013 over one month after the SOR was \nissued \u2013 and there is an acknowledgement that the first payment was received by the \ncreditor. The second payment was due August 1, 2019, nearly three weeks before \nApplicant\u2019s Response to the FORM was due, but he failed to submit any documentation \nto indicate that the payment had been made. (Account Details, dated July 23, 2019, \n\n \n4 \n                                      \n \nattached to the Response to the FORM) In the absence of such documentation, I \nconclude that the account is not yet fully in the process of being resolved. \nSOR \u00b6 1.d.: This is a bank-issued charge account with a $100 credit limit and a \npast-due balance of $192. The account was subsequently sold to a debt purchaser. (Item \n5, at 5; Item 6, at 2-3) Applicant admitted that he is indebted to the creditor, but contended \nthat he has been making agreed-upon unspecified \u201cpayments through company.\u201d (Item \n2, at 2) He did not identify the company to whom the payments were being made; nor did \nhe specify the amount of the payments, or when those payments commenced. He failed \nto submit any documentation, such as a statement from the creditor agreeing to a \nrepayment plan, cancelled checks, copies of money orders, a bank register, or receipts, \nto support his contention that he has an agreement and that he is making any payments \nto the creditor. In the absence of such documentation, I conclude that the account is not \nyet in the process of being resolved. \nSOR \u00b6 1.e.: This is a bank-issued charge account with a jewelry store with a $820 \ncredit limit and a past-due balance of $750. The account was subsequently sold to a debt \npurchaser. (Item 5, at 4; Item 6, at 3) Applicant admitted that he is indebted to the creditor, \nbut contended that he has been making agreed-upon unspecified \u201cpayments through \ncompany.\u201d (Item 2, at 2) He submitted a payment plan calling for 13 monthly payments of \n$50, commencing on July 1, 2019 \u2013 over one month after the SOR was issued \u2013 and \nthere is an acknowledgement that the first payment was received by the creditor. The \nsecond payment was due August 1, 2019, nearly three weeks before Applicant\u2019s \nResponse to the FORM was due, but he failed to submit any documentation to indicate \nthat the payment had been made. (Account Details, dated July 23, 2019, attached to the \nResponse to the FORM) In the absence of such documentation, I conclude that the \naccount is not yet fully in the process of being resolved. \nSOR \u00b6 1.f.: This is a bank-issued charge account with a high credit of $4,851 and \nan unpaid and past-due balance of $4,548. An unspecified amount was charged off. The \naccount was subsequently sold to a debt purchaser. (Item 5, at 13; Item 6, at 3) Applicant \nadmitted that he is indebted to the creditor, but contended that he has been making \nagreed-upon unspecified \u201cpayments through company.\u201d (Item 2, at 2) He submitted a \npayment plan calling for 43 monthly payments of $101.06, commencing on July 1, 2019 \n\u2013 over one month after the SOR was issued \u2013 and there is an acknowledgement that the \nfirst payment was received by the creditor. The second payment was due August 1, 2019, \nnearly three weeks before Applicant\u2019s Response to the FORM was due, but he failed to \nsubmit any documentation to indicate that the payment had been made. (Account Details, \ndated July 23, 2019, attached to the Response to the FORM) In the absence of such \ndocumentation, I conclude that the account is not yet fully in the process of being \nresolved. \nSOR \u00b6 1.g.: This is a bank-issued charge account with a $2,000 credit limit and an \nunpaid balance of $2,673 that was charged off. (Item 5, at 13; Item 6, at 4) Applicant \nadmitted that he is indebted to the creditor, but contended that he was working to set up \na payment plan. (Item 2, at 2) He submitted a payment plan calling for 44 monthly \n\n \n5 \n                                      \n \npayments of $60.75, commencing on July 1, 2019 \u2013 over one month after the SOR was \nissued \u2013 but he offered no evidence that the payments had actually started. (Account \nDetails, dated July 23, 2019, attached to the Response to the FORM) In the absence of \nsuch evidence, I conclude that the account is not yet in the process of being resolved. \nSOR \u00b6 1.h.: This is a bank-issued credit-card account with a $1,400 credit limit and \nan unpaid and past-due balance of $1,635 that was charged off. (Item 5, at 14; Item 6, at \n4-5) Applicant admitted that he is indebted to the creditor, but contended that he was \nworking to set up a payment plan. (Item 2, at 2) He submitted a settlement offer calling \nfor six monthly payments of $109, totaling $654, commencing on August 22, 2019 \u2013 \napproximately three months after the SOR was issued \u2013 but he offered no evidence that \nthe offer had been agreed to by the creditor, or that the payments had actually started. \n(Settlement Offer, dated August 15, 2019, attached to the Response to the FORM) In the \nabsence of such evidence, I conclude that the account is not yet in the process of being \nresolved. \nSOR \u00b6 1.i.: This is a bank-issued credit-card account with a $4,600 credit limit and \nan unpaid and past-due balance of $4,689. On an unspecified date, $4,739 was charged \noff. (Item 5, at 14; Item 6, at 5-6) Applicant admitted that he is indebted to the creditor, \nbut contended that he was working to set up a payment plan. (Item 2, at 2) He failed to \nsubmit any documentation, such as a statement from the creditor agreeing to a repayment \nplan, cancelled checks, copies of money orders, a bank register, or receipts, to support \nhis contention that he was working on an agreement or that he is making any payments \nto the creditor. In the absence of such documentation, I conclude that the account is not \nyet in the process of being resolved. \nSOR \u00b6 1.j.: This is a bank-issued credit-card account with a $500 credit limit and \nan unpaid and past-due balance of $842 that was charged off. (Item 5, at 4; Item 6, at 6) \nApplicant admitted that he is indebted to the creditor, but contended that he was working \nto set up a payment plan. (Item 2, at 2) He failed to submit any documentation, such as \na statement from the creditor agreeing to a repayment plan, cancelled checks, copies of \nmoney orders, a bank register, or receipts, to support his contention that he was working \non an agreement or that he is making any payments to the creditor. In the absence of \nsuch documentation, I conclude that the account is not yet in the process of being \nresolved. \nSOR \u00b6 1.k.: This is a bank-issued charge account with a $1,500 credit limit and an \nunpaid balance of $2,817. An unspecified amount was charged off, and the account was \ntransferred or sold to a debt purchaser. (Item 5, at 11; Item 6, at 9) Applicant admitted \nthat he is indebted to the creditor, but contended that he was working to set up a payment \nplan. (Item 2, at 2) He failed to submit any documentation, such as a statement from the \ncreditor agreeing to a repayment plan, cancelled checks, copies of money orders, a bank \nregister, or receipts, to support his contention that he was working on an agreement or \nthat he is making any payments to the creditor. In the absence of such documentation, I \nconclude that the account is not yet in the process of being resolved. \n\n \n6 \n                                      \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.l.: This is an unspecified type of account with a pest-control company with \nan unpaid balance of $297. (Item 5, at 12) Applicant denied that he is indebted to the \ncreditor, and claimed that he had already paid off the account. (Item 2, at 2) He failed to \nsubmit any documentation, such as a receipt from the creditor, cancelled checks, copies \nof money orders, a bank register, to support his contention that the account had already \nbeen paid off. In the absence of such documentation, I conclude that the account is not \nyet in the process of being resolved. \nSOR \u00b6 1.m.: This is cellular-telephone account with an unpaid balance of $219. \n(Item 6, at 7; Item 5, at 14) Applicant denied that he is indebted to the creditor, and claimed \nthat he had already paid off the account. (Item 2, at 2) Applicant\u2019s 2019 credit report noted \nthat there was a payment of $293 made in May 2018, and that there is no a zero balance. \n(Item 6, at 7) I conclude that the account has been resolved. \nAs noted above, Applicant indicated that he was willing to sell his home in order to \ngenerate the funds necessary to resolve his delinquent debts. However, as of April 2019, \nwhen he made a mortgage payment of $1,180, the house had not been sold, and he still \nhad a mortgage of $212,589. (Item 4, at 9; Item 6, at 3) It is not known what Applicant\u2019s \ncurrent financial resources may be because he did not report his current net monthly \nincome; monthly expenses; and any monthly remainder that might be available for \ndiscretionary spending or savings. There is no evidence of a budget. There is no evidence \nof financial counseling. In the absence of additional financial information, it remains \ndifficult to determine if Applicant is currently in a better position financially than he had \nbeen.  \nPolicies \n \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the Executive \nBranch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security emphasizing, \n\u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d (Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. \n518, 528 (1988)) As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to control \naccess to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual \nis sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information. The President has \nauthorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant an applicant eligibility for \naccess to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to do so.\u201d (Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \nIndustry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified.)     \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the guidelines in SEAD 4. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the guidelines list potentially disqualifying \nconditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility \nfor access to classified information. \n \nAn administrative judge need not view the guidelines as inflexible, ironclad rules \nof law. Instead, acknowledging the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The \n\n \n7 \n                                      \n \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. The entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known \nas the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a meaningful decision. \n \nIn the decision-making process, facts must be established by \u201csubstantial \nevidence.\u201d \u201cSubstantial evidence [is] such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might \naccept as adequate to support a conclusion in light of all contrary evidence in the record.\u201d  \n(ISCR Case No. 04-11463 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2006) (citing Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1))  \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d  (See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994)) \n \nThe Government initially has the burden of producing evidence to establish a \npotentially disqualifying condition under the Directive, and has the burden of establishing \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Once the Government has produced substantial \nevidence of a disqualifying condition, under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant has the \nburden of persuasion to present evidence in refutation, explanation, extenuation or \nmitigation, sufficient to overcome the doubts raised by the Government\u2019s case. The \nburden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government. (See ISCR \nCase No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005)) \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours as well. It is \nbecause of this special relationship that the Government must be able to repose a high \ndegree of trust and confidence in those individuals to whom it grants access to classified \ninformation. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the \napplicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. Such \ndecisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather \nthan actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Furthermore, \u201csecurity clearance \ndeterminations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d (Egan, 484 U.S. at 531) \n \nClearance decisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense \nbe a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d (See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 \n7) Thus, nothing in this decision should be construed to suggest that I have based this \ndecision, in whole or in part, on any express or implied determination as to Applicant\u2019s \nallegiance, loyalty, or patriotism. It is merely an indication the Applicant has or has not \nmet the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for \nissuing a clearance.  In reaching this decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that \nare reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I \nhave avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \n \n \n\n \n8 \n                                      \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG \u00b6 18:  \n      \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19:  \n \n(a) inability to satisfy debts;  \n(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so;  \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and  \n \n(e) consistent spending beyond one\u2019s means or frivolous or irresponsible \nspending, which may be indicated by excessive indebtedness, significant \nnegative cash flow, a history of late payments or of non-payment, or other \nnegative financial indicators. \n \n \nThe SOR alleged 13 delinquent accounts totaling approximately $21,395. With the \nexception of the three debts for which he denied any responsibility, and the one for which \nthere is conclusive evidence of resolution, Applicant admitted that the debts were his \nresponsibility. His 2019 purchase of his third vehicle (or fourth vehicle if counting the \nmotorcycle) with a monthly payment of $686, for one claiming insufficient funds to address \nhis delinquent debts, seems to indicate that he preferred to create more debt at the \nexpense of resolving his delinquent debts. With respect to his failure to satisfy his various \ndelinquent debts, and instead acquired new debts, AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a), 19(b), 19(c), and 19(e) \nhave been established.  \n \n\n \n9 \n                                      \n \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns arising from financial difficulties under AG \u00b6 20: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; and \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \n  \nAG \u00b6 20(b) minimally applies, but none of the other conditions apply. A debt that \nbecame delinquent several years ago is still considered recent because \u201can applicant\u2019s \nongoing, unpaid debts evidence a continuing course of conduct and, therefore, can be \nviewed as recent for purposes of the Guideline F mitigating conditions.\u201d ISCR Case No. \n15-06532 at 3 (App. Bd. Feb. 16, 2017) (citing ISCR Case No. 15-01690 at 2 (App. Bd. \nSept. 13, 2016)). The nature, frequency, and recency of Applicant\u2019s continuing financial \ndifficulties, and his failure to voluntarily and timely resolve his delinquent accounts for \nseveral years, and in fact, incur a significant additional monthly obligation make it rather \neasy to conclude that it was not infrequent and it is likely to remain unchanged, much like \nit has been for several years. Applicant has attempted to attribute his financial problems \nto his separation and divorce and having insufficient funds. He did not specify how those \nissues impacted his finances. Furthermore, he failed to explain why, during a period of \nclaimed insufficient funds, he purchased a third vehicle to go along with his other two cars \nand one motorcycle.  \n \nAn applicant who begins to resolve his financial problems only after being placed \non notice that his or her security clearance is in jeopardy may be lacking in the judgment \nand self-discipline to follow rules and regulations over time or when there is no immediate \nthreat to his or her own interests. (See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 17-01213 at 5 (App. Bd. Jun. \n29, 2018); ISCR Case No. 17-00569 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Sept. 18, 2018). Applicant \ncompleted his e-QIP in April 2018; underwent his OPM interview in June 2018; and the \nSOR was issued in May 2019. Each step of the security clearance review process placed \nhim on notice of the significance of the financial issues confronting him. With one \nexception, Applicant did not contact his creditors either to seek repayment agreements, \nor to actually start making payments, until July 2019 \u2013 nearly two months after the SOR \n\n \n10 \n                                      \n \nwas issued. His proven history of making payments reflects very modest solitary \npayments several creditors, as well as ignoring the remaining creditors.  \n \nClearance decisions are aimed at evaluating an applicant\u2019s judgment, reliability, \nand trustworthiness. They are not a debt-collection procedure. The guidelines do not \nrequire an applicant to establish resolution of every debt or issue alleged in the SOR. An \napplicant needs only to establish a plan to resolve financial problems and take significant \nactions to implement the plan. There is no requirement that an applicant immediately \nresolve issues or make payments on all delinquent debts simultaneously, nor is there a \nrequirement that the debts or issues alleged in an SOR be resolved first. Rather, a \nreasonable plan and concomitant conduct may provide for the payment of such debts, or \nresolution of such issues, one at a time. Mere promises to pay debts in the future, without \nfurther confirmed action, are insufficient.  \nIt should be noted that the Appeal Board has indicated that promises to pay off \ndelinquent debts in the future are not a substitute for a track record of paying debts in a \ntimely manner and otherwise acting in a financially responsible manner. (ISCR Case No. \n07-13041 at 4 (App. Bd. Sep. 19, 2008) (citing ISCR Case No. 99-0012 at 3 (App. Bd. \nDec. 1, 1999)) In this instance, there is evidence, supported by documentation, that \nApplicant took some corrective actions with respect to some of his delinquent debts well \nafter he was interviewed by the OPM investigator. There are also substantial unverified \ncomments by Applicant that he resolved or started to resolve some delinquent accounts, \nbut he offered no documentation to support his contentions. His contentions regarding \nthe status of some accounts, and his unverified comments claiming that he had taken \ncertain actions, without documents, to support his claims, are insufficient to reflect good-\nfaith actions. The Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a good-faith \neffort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts: \nIn order to qualify for application of [the \u201cgood-faith\u201d mitigating condition], an \napplicant must present evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or some other good-faith action aimed at resolving the \napplicant\u2019s debts. The Directive does not define the term \u201cgood-faith.\u201d \nHowever, the Board has indicated that the concept of good-faith \u201crequires \na showing that a person acts in a way that shows reasonableness, \nprudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.\u201d Accordingly, an \napplicant must do more than merely show that he or she relied on a legally \navailable option (such as bankruptcy [or statute of limitations]) in order to \nclaim the benefit of [the \u201cgood-faith\u201d mitigating condition].  \n \n(internal citation and footnote omitted) ISCR Case No. 02-30304 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 20, \n2004) (quoting ISCR Case No. 99-9020 at 5-6 (App. Bd. June 4, 2001). \n \nThere is no evidence of financial counseling or a budget. In the absence of \nadditional financial information, it remains difficult to determine if Applicant is currently in \na better position financially than he had been. Applicant\u2019s actions, or inaction, under the \n\n \n11 \n                                      \n \ncircumstances cast doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. \nSee ISCR Case No. 09-08533 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Oct. 6, 2010). \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6 2(d): \n  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nUnder SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. Moreover, I have \nevaluated the various aspects of this case in light of the totality of the record evidence \nand have not merely performed a piecemeal analysis. See U.S. v. Bottone, 365 F.2d 389, \n392 (2d Cir. 1966); see also ISCR Case No. 03-22861 at 2-3 (App. Bd. Jun. 2, 2006).  \n \nThere is some evidence in favor of mitigating Applicant\u2019s financial concerns. \nApplicant is a 41-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has been serving as an \nassociate systems administrator with his current employer since September 2016. He is \na 1996 high school graduate. Applicant enlisted in the U.S. Army in November 1996, and \nhe remained on active duty, including service in both Iraq and Afghanistan, until he was \nhonorably retired in December 2016. He was treated for PTSD in 2014. He was granted \na secret clearance in 1996, and he reported that he was granted access to SCI in 2012.  \n \nThe disqualifying evidence under the whole-person concept is simply more \nsubstantial. Applicant had a number of delinquent accounts that were ignored by him until \nat least July 2019 two months after the SOR was issued, and nearly a year after he was \ninterviewed by the OPM investigator. Rather than starting on resolving his delinquent \ndebts, in January 2019, he purchased his fourth vehicle, including three other cars and \none motorcycle. Applicant claimed that he had paid off some of the creditors, or entered \ninto repayment agreements with other creditors. However, with rare exceptions, because \nof his failure to submit documentation associated with his delinquent accounts, such as \nreceipts, cancelled checks, or bank account transactions, to support his contentions that \nsome accounts have been settled, paid off, or otherwise resolved; or that agreed \nsettlements have actually proceeded to resolution; or that payments have actually been \nmade to his creditors, it is difficult to assess the true situation, for we have mostly \nApplicant\u2019s unverified comments claiming that he had taken certain actions. \n\n \n12 \n                                      \n \nIn ISCR Case No. 07-06482 at 2-3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008), the Appeal Board \naddressed a key element in the whole-person analysis in financial cases stating: \n \nIn evaluating Guideline F cases, the Board has previously noted that the \nconcept of \u201cmeaningful track record\u201d necessarily includes evidence of actual \ndebt reduction through payment of debts. However, an applicant is not \nrequired, as a matter of law, to establish that he [or she] has paid off each \nand every debt listed in the SOR. All that is required is that an applicant \ndemonstrate that he [or she] has \u201c. . . established a plan to resolve his [or \nher] financial problems and taken significant actions to implement that plan.\u201d \nThe Judge can reasonably consider the entirety of an applicant\u2019s financial \nsituation and his [or her] actions in evaluating the extent to which that \napplicant\u2019s plan for the reduction of his outstanding indebtedness is credible \nand realistic. See Directive \u00b6 E2.2(a) (\u201cAvailable, reliable information about \nthe person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, should be \nconsidered in reaching a determination.\u201d) There is no requirement that a \nplan provide for payments on all outstanding debts simultaneously. Rather, \na reasonable plan (and concomitant conduct) may provide for the payment \nof such debts one at a time. Likewise, there is no requirement that the first \ndebts actually paid in furtherance of a reasonable debt plan be the ones \nlisted in the SOR. \n \nWhile Applicant contended that he took certain actions with respect to his \ndelinquent debts, there is very little documentary evidence to indicate that many of those \naccounts have been addressed. He did submit documentation that he had made his first \nrather modest payments to some creditors in July 2019. Applicant\u2019s current track record \nis poor at best. Overall, the evidence leaves me with substantial questions and doubts as \nto Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all of these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant has failed to mitigate the security concerns arising from his financial \nconsiderations. See SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6\u00b6 2(d)(1) through AG 2(d)(9). \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a., through 1.l.:  \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.m.:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n13 \n                                      \n \nConclusion \n \n \n In light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nApplicant submitted a security clearance application (SCA) on April 3, 2017. On \nJune 25, 2019, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications Facility (DOD \nCAF) sent him a Statement of Reasons (SOR) alleging security concerns under Guideline \nH. The DOD CAF acted under Executive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) effective on June 8, \n2017. \n \nApplicant answered the SOR on July 17, 2019 (Ans.), and requested a decision \nbased on the administrative record, without a hearing. The Government\u2019s written brief \nwith supporting documents, known as the File of Relevant Material (FORM), was \nsubmitted by Department Counsel on August 19, 2019. The case was assigned to me on \n\n \n2 \n \nNovember 21, 2019. A complete copy of the FORM was provided to Applicant, who was \nafforded an opportunity to file objections and submit material to refute, rebut, or mitigate \nthe security concerns. Applicant received the FORM on August 28, 2019, but he did not \nsubmit a reply nor did he object to any matters contained in the record. Government \nExhibits (GE) 1 through 3 are admitted into evidence without objection. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant is a 30-year-old circuit design engineer, employed by a government \ncontractor since March 2017. He previously worked for the same company from May 2013 \nto June 2015, but resigned to avoid being reassigned to another facility in another state. \nHe graduated from high school in 2008, and earned two bachelor\u2019s degrees in 2012. He \nis unmarried and does not have any children. Applicant has never held a DOD security \nclearance. \n \nThe SOR alleges under Guideline H (Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse) \nthat Applicant used marijuana from approximately 2005 to present, including after \ncompleting a DOD security clearance application (SCA); and that he intends to continue \nusing marijuana in the future. In his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted the \nallegations, and explained that he intends to continue to use marijuana on a recreational \nbasis, outside of working hours, in accordance with state regulations. \n \nApplicant submitted an SCA in April 2017. In it, he disclosed a history of using \nmarijuana (THC) since January 2005. He also disclosed past use of 3,4-methylenedioxy-\nmethamphetamine (MDMA) (also known as ecstasy or molly), three times from October \n2008 to February 2015. He stopped using MDMA because he was no longer interested \nin it, and because it was illegal. \n \nApplicant was first caught using marijuana while in high school. He completed a \ndrug awareness program in lieu of a suspension. More recently, he typically used \nmarijuana with his girlfriend, friend, and roommate, usually with a smoking device (bong) \nor by consuming edibles. He purchased marijuana and MDMA illegally from friends until \nDecember 2012, when recreational use of marijuana became legal in his state, and it \ncould be legally purchased under state law, at state-approved dispensaries. \n \nApplicant was twice drug tested by his current employer; including when he was \nfirst hired in 2013, and again when he was rehired in March 2017. He passed both tests. \nApplicant stopped using marijuana prior to applying for jobs because he was concerned \nthat he would test positive. Despite his employer\u2019s pre-employment drug tests, Applicant \nclaimed that he is unaware of his company\u2019s illegal drug-use policy, and would stop if his \ncompany asks, but he understands use of marijuana is illegal under federal law. After \nApplicant was rehired and subsequently completed his SCA, he resumed using \nmarijuana. \n \n \n\n \n3 \n \nApplicant stated that he does not believe marijuana use is a problem as long as \nhe does not use it on company time. He compared it to drinking beer. He stated he intends \nto continue to use marijuana with his friends, who have used it with him in the past. He \nenjoys the effects he gets from THC, and he believes it has not created any problems for \nhim. He stated that he will continue to use marijuana under state law, despite his \nknowledge that it is illegal under federal law. He asserted that he has no ties to the U.S. \ngovernment, so he sees no reason to stop using marijuana. \n \nPolicies \n \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 2. \n \nNational security eligibility is predicated upon the applicant meeting the criteria \ncontained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. \nInstead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge applies \nthese guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative \njudge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider a person\u2019s stability, trustworthiness, reliability, \ndiscretion, character, honesty, and judgment. AG \u00b6 1(b). \n \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865  \n\u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \n \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \u201cSubstantial \nevidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. Washington \nMetro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines presume a \n\n \n4 \n \nnexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria listed \ntherein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 12-01295 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Jan. 20, 2015). \n \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, \nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. \n02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \n \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01- \n20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see, AG \u00b6 1(d). \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline H: Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \n \nThe security concern for drug involvement and substance misuse is set out in AG \n\u00b6 24: \n \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior may \nlead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. Controlled substance means any \u201ccontrolled substance\u201d as \ndefined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term adopted in \nthis guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above. \n \nThe guideline notes conditions that could raise security concerns under AG \u00b6 25. \nThe disqualifying conditions potentially applicable in this case include: \n \n(a) any substance misuse (see above definition); \n \n(c) illegal possession of a controlled substance, including . . .purchase, . . . \nor possession of drug paraphernalia ; and \n \n(g) expressed intent to continue drug involvement and substance misuse, or \nfailure to clearly and convincingly commit to discontinue such misuse. \n \nApplicant admitted to purchasing and using marijuana from 2005 to present, \nincluding after completing a government SCA in 2017. He also expressed his intent to \n\n \n5 \n \ncontinue to use marijuana as long as it remains legal under state law. Disqualifying \nconditions AG \u00b6\u00b6 25 (a), (c), and (g) apply. \n \nAG \u00b6 26 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns, and I have \nconsidered them all. No mitigating condition applies to this case. Applicant has a history \nof regular marijuana use since 2005. He also clearly and unambiguously stated his intent \nto continue to use marijuana in the future, including with friends with whom he used \nmarijuana in the past. Marijuana use remains illegal under federal law and government \nsecurity regulations. Applicant\u2019s history of regular marijuana use and expressed intent to \ncontinue using it in the future is inconsistent with federal law and regulations governing \ndefense industry employees entrusted with the nation\u2019s secrets. Applicant\u2019s drug use \nhistory and future intent raise serious questions about his judgment, willingness to follow \nlaws, rules, and regulations, and overall trustworthiness. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nThe ultimate determination of whether to grant national security eligibility must be \nan overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the guidelines \nand the whole-person concept. Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge \nmust evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality \nof the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant circumstances. AG \u00b6\u00b6 2(a), 2(c), and 2(d). The \nadministrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 \n2(d). \n \nI considered all of the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my findings of fact \nand comments under Guideline H in my whole-person analysis. I also considered \nApplicant\u2019s voluntary disclosures in his SCA and PSA, as well as his illegal use of MDMA \non three occasions until 2015, and regular use of marijuana since 2005.  \n \nAdditionally, I considered Applicant\u2019s expressed intent to continue to use \nmarijuana, despite all that he knows about the security clearance and defense industry \nemployment process, and drug-use prohibitions under federal law. Applicant has clearly \nexpressed his intent to use marijuana, now and in the future, regardless of federal law or \nregulation. Accordingly, I conclude Applicant has not carried his burden of showing that it \nis clearly consistent with the national security interests of the United States to grant him \neligibility for access to classified information. \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline H:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n  Subparagraphs 1.a and 1.b: \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n\n \n6 \n \nConclusion \n \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national security interest of the \nUnited States to grant Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nApplicant\u2019s security clearance is denied. \n \n \n   _______________________ \nGregg A.

Crowley, Esq., Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro se \n \n11/21/2019 \n______________ \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \n \nFOREMAN, LeRoy F., Administrative Judge: \n \nThis case involves security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial \nConsiderations). Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nApplicant submitted a security clearance application on August 13, 2018. On May \n31, 2019, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications Facility (DOD CAF) \nsent him a Statement of Reasons (SOR) alleging security concerns under Guideline F. \nThe DOD CAF acted under Executive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, \nDefense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as \namended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated in Security \nExecutive Agent Directive 4, National Security Adjudicative Guidelines (December 10, \n2016). \n \n \nApplicant answered the SOR on June 25, 2019, and requested a hearing before \nan administrative judge. Department Counsel was ready to proceed on July 29, 2019, \nand the case was assigned to me on August 27, 2019. On the same day, the Defense \n\n \n2 \n \nOffice of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) notified Applicant that the hearing was \nscheduled for September 24, 2019. I convened the hearing as scheduled. Government \nExhibits (GX) 1 through 4 were admitted in evidence without objection. Applicant \ntestified and submitted Applicant\u2019s Exhibit (AX) A, which was admitted without objection. \nI kept the record open until October 11, 2019, to enable him to submit additional \ndocumentary evidence. He timely submitted AX B, which was admitted without \nobjection. DOHA received the transcript (Tr.) on October 15, 2019. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn Applicant\u2019s answer to the SOR, he admitted all the allegations. His admissions \nin his answer and at the hearing are incorporated in my findings of fact.  \n \n \nApplicant is a 39-year-old nuclear quality-control inspector employed by a \ndefense contractor since May 2018. He served on active duty in the U.S. Navy from \nJanuary 2001 to January 2015. He was involuntarily discharged, with an honorable \ndischarge, under the Navy\u2019s high-tenure rule (failure to be promoted). He was \nunemployed from February to October 2015. He worked in the private sector from \nOctober 2015 until he was hired for his current job. He held a security clearance while \non active duty, but it expired because of the time gap between his discharge from the \nNavy and his employment by a defense contractor.  \n \nApplicant married in May 2002 and has three children, ages 19, 16, and 13. He \nenrolled in a community college immediately after being discharged, and he received an \nassociate\u2019s degree in February 2017.  \n \nThe SOR alleges 12 delinquent debts totaling about $31,496. Six of the debts are \nstudent loans totaling about $29,831. The debts are reflected in credit reports from May \n2019 and August 2018 (GX 3 and 4.) The evidence concerning the delinquent debts \nalleged in the SOR is summarized below. \n \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.e: credit-card accounts charged off for $436 and 428; \ncollection account for $281; telecommunication account placed for collection of \n$170; and utility bill placed for collection of $149. As of the date the record closed, \nApplicant had taken no action to resolve these debts.  \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.f: government debt for overpayment of tuition, placed for \ncollection of $201. This bill was incurred when Applicant failed to pass a college \ncourse paid for under the Post-9/11 GI Bill. He testified that this debt was resolved by \ndiversion of his federal income tax refund, and he is again attending classes using his \nGI Bill benefits. (Tr. 27, 33-34.) The May 2019 credit report reflects that the debt was \npaid. (GX 3 at 3.) \n \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.g-1.l: student loans totaling about $29,831. In August 2019, \nApplicant entered into a rehabilitation program for his delinquent student loans, \n\n \n3 \n \nproviding for nine monthly payments of $47. (AX A.) As of the date of the hearing, he \nhad made the first three monthly payments. (AX B.)  \n \nApplicant testified that he incurred moving expenses when he moved from \nanother state to accept his current job, and he received some financial assistance from \nhis current employer for the costs of moving. (Tr. 21.) He also testified that he obtained \nloans for car maintenance and repairs. (Tr. 24.) However, he provided no \ndocumentation to corroborate his testimony.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s current gross pay is about $47,800 per year. His wife is not employed \noutside the home. He estimates that his net monthly remainder after paying all his \nfinancial obligations and living expenses is about $100. (Tr. 23.) He has not sought or \nreceived financial counseling.  \n \nPolicies \n \n \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 2.  \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge \napplies these guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \n \n \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec. Or. \n10865 \u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the \napplicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense \nhave established for issuing a clearance. \n \n\n \n4 \n \n \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in \nthe personal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant \nfrom being eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden \nof establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the \ncriteria listed therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 15-\n01253 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2016).   \n \n \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, \nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-\n31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).  \n \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. \n01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, \nif they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18:  \n \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. . . . An individual who is \nfinancially overextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or \notherwise questionable acts to generate funds. . . . \n \n \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified information to raise money. It encompasses concerns about a \nperson\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting classified \ninformation. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information. See \nISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s admissions and the evidence submitted at the hearing establish the \nfollowing disqualifying conditions under this guideline: AG \u00b6 19(a) (\u201cinability to satisfy \ndebts\u201d); AG \u00b6 19(b) (\u201cunwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so\u201d); \nand AG \u00b6 19(c) (\u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations\u201d).  \n\n \n5 \n \nThe following mitigating conditions are potentially applicable:  \n \nAG \u00b6 20(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not \ncast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \nAG \u00b6 20(b): the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were \nlargely beyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; and \n \nAG \u00b6 20(d): the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to \nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.  \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(a) is not established. Applicant\u2019s delinquent debts are recent, numerous, \nand were not incurred under circumstances making recurrence unlikely. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(b) is not fully established. Applicant\u2019s involuntary separation from the \nNavy and subsequent unemployment for about eight months were conditions beyond \nhis control. However, he has not acted responsibly. He has taken no action to resolve \nthe consumer debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b61.a-1.e, even though they are for relatively small \namounts. He took no affirmative action to resolve the government debt, which was \ncollected by diversion of his federal income tax refund. He took no action to resolve his \nstudent loans until the month before his hearing, well after he received the SOR and \nrealized that they were an impediment to obtaining a security clearance. An applicant \nwho waits until his clearance is in jeopardy before resolving debts may be lacking in the \njudgment expected of those with access to classified information. ISCR Case No. 16-\n01211 (App. Bd. May 30, 2018) citing ISCR Case No. 15-03208 at 5 (App. Bd. Mar. 7, \n2017). \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(d) is not established. Applicant has taken no action to resolve the debts \nalleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.e. The collection of the government overpayment was by \ninvoluntary diversion of his federal income tax return, which does not constitute a \u201cgood-\nfaith effort\u201d to resolve it. See ISCR Case No. 09-05700 (App. Bd. Feb. 24, 2011). He \nhas begun a rehabilitation program for his delinquent student loans, but it is too soon to \ndetermine if he will complete it, and his track record of neglecting his debts raises doubt \nwhether he will comply with the terms of any student loans that are granted even if he \ncompletes the rehabilitation program. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-\n\n \n6 \n \nperson concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process \nfactors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \n \nI have incorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-person \nanalysis and applied the adjudicative factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). After weighing the \ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions under Guideline F, and evaluating all the \nevidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has not mitigated the \nsecurity concerns raised by his delinquent debts. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \n \n \nGuideline F (Financial Considerations):  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.l: \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national security interests of the \nUnited States to grant Applicant eligibility for access to classified information.

Eligibility for a security clearance is denied. \nStatement of the Case \nOn August 2, 2018, Applicant applied for a security clearance and submitted a \nQuestionnaire for National Security Positions (SF 86). On June 7, 2019, the Department \nof Defense (DOD) Consolidated Adjudications Facility (CAF) issued a Statement of \nReasons (SOR) to him, under Executive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended and modified; \nDOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program \n(January 2, 1992), as amended and modified (Directive); and Directive 4 of the Security \nExecutive Agent (SEAD 4), National Security Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) (December \n10, 2016), for all covered individuals who require initial or continued eligibility for access \nto classified information or eligibility to hold a sensitive position, effective June 8, 2017. \n The SOR alleged security concerns under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) \nand detailed reasons why the DOD adjudicators were unable to find that it is clearly \n\n \n2 \n                                      \n \nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant. \nThe SOR recommended referral to an administrative judge to determine whether a \nclearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked.  \n \n \nIn a sworn statement dated July 16, 2019, Applicant responded to the SOR, and \nhe elected to have his case decided on the written record in lieu of a hearing. (Item 2)  A \ncomplete copy of the Government\u2019s file of relevant material (FORM) was mailed to \nApplicant by the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) on September 5, 2019, \nand he was afforded an opportunity after receipt of the FORM to file objections and submit \nmaterial in refutation, extenuation, or mitigation. In addition to the FORM, Applicant was \nfurnished a copy of the Directive as well as the Adjudicative Guidelines applicable to his \ncase. Applicant received the FORM on September 18, 2019. His response was due on \nOctober 18, 2019. Applicant chose not to respond to the FORM, for as of November 27, \n2019, no response had been received. The case was assigned to me on November 27, \n2019.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nIn his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted, with extensive comments, nearly all \nof the SOR allegations pertaining to financial considerations (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a. through 1.i., \n1.k., 1.o., and 1.p.).

He has no children.  \n \nFinancial Considerations  \n \nGeneral source information pertaining to the financial accounts discussed below \ncan be found in the following exhibits: Item 5 (Combined Experian, TransUnion, and \nEquifax Credit Report, dated September 25, 2018); Item 4 (Equifax Credit Report, dated \nApril 29, 2019); Item 6 (Enhanced Subject Interview, dated January 15, 2019); Item 2 \n(Applicant\u2019s Answer to SOR, dated July 16, 2019); Item 2 (TransUnion Credit Report, \ndated July 1, 2019, attached to Applicant\u2019s Answer to the SOR Answer); and Item 2 \n\n \n3 \n                                      \n \n(Equifax Credit Report, dated July 1, 2019, attached to Applicant\u2019s Answer to the SOR \nAnswer). \nApplicant attributed his financial problems to his two failed marriages and his \ndisability. His first wife ran up his credit card balances while he was away at training. \nDuring his separation from his first wife, he was required to pay her $985 in monthly \nalimony, and one-half of his basic housing allowance was directed to her. That situation \ncontinued for 13 months. As a corporal with the USMC, his income was depleted. When \nhe remarried, he had to establish a new home with furniture and household items, and he \nneeded a vehicle for his new wife to get to work. In September 2015, he was medically \nretired, and he found it hard to hold a steady job due to the injuries he had sustained while \non active duty. Eventually, his wife lost her job, and with very little money left after his \ndivorce, he and his new wife struggled financially for five years before finally separating. \n(Item 2, at 1-2; Item 6, at 17-18) \nWhen Applicant completed his SF 86 in August 2018, he acknowledged having \none delinquent automobile-loan account. (Item 3, at 40-42)  In January 2019, during his \ninterview with an investigator from the U.S. Office of Personnel Management (OPM), \nApplicant discussed that automobile-loan account as well as a number of additional \ndelinquent accounts. He stated that his home was flooded by a category 4 hurricane in \nmid-September 2018, and he lost all of his bills and property, and/or he lost track of \neverything. He acknowledged that he now had a steady check coming in, and he intended \nto start calling his creditors at the beginning of February 2019 in an effort to work on \npayment plans or possibly eliminate some of the interest on his debts. His repayment plan \nwas to address other debts first, and then start working on these smaller debts before \nattempting to resolve the larger ones. He claimed to have altered his actions by no longer \nusing credit cards, and only purchasing items for which he has cash in hand. (Item 6, at \n18) \nThe SOR alleged 18 delinquent accounts totaling approximately $76,530, as set \nforth as follows: SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a. through 1.e., 1.h., 1.i., 1.k., and 1.p.: various accounts with \npast-due and unpaid balances of $28,813, $13,529, $5,281, $4,133, $3,328, $806, $443, \n$80, and $12,101 that were charged off, that Applicant admits are delinquent; SOR \u00b6\u00b6 \n1.f. and 1.g.: two cellular telephone accounts with unpaid balances of $2,826 and $842, \nthat Applicant admits are delinquent. (Item 4, at 1-33; Item 5, at 5-7; Item 2, at 1-2) There \nis SOR \u00b6 1.q.: a credit-card account with a past-due balance of $398 and an unpaid \nbalance of $2,745, that Applicant acknowledged that he owed, but when he obtained his \nJuly 2019 credit reports, the account, which became delinquent in 2013, appeared in the \nTransUnion credit report reflecting a zero balance, and it no longer appears in his Equifax \ncredit report. (Item 5, at 8; Item 6, at 13; Item 2 (TransUnion Credit Report, at 14); Item 2 \n(Equifax Credit Report)) There is SOR \u00b6 1.r.: a cellular telephone account with an unpaid \nbalance of $825 that was sold or transferred to a debt collector or purchaser, that \nApplicant acknowledged that he owed, but when he obtained his July 2019 credit reports, \nthe account, which became delinquent in 2013, no longer appears in the 2019 TransUnion \nor Equifax credit reports. (Item 5, at 13; Item 6, at 13; Item 2 (TransUnion Credit Report); \nItem 2 (Equifax Credit Report))    \n\n \n4 \n                                      \n \nIn addition, there are SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.j., and 1.l. through 1.o.: five medical debts with \nunpaid balances of $244, $48, $30, $30, and $28. (Item 4, at 2-3; Item 5, at 13; Item 6, at \n12-13; Item 2, at 1-2) Applicant denied owing four of the debts, claiming that he had \nalready paid them off, but he admitted that one such account, with the $28 balance, is \ndelinquent, but which he claims was recently transferred to another collection agent, and \nwould probably be removed from his credit report because of the small balance. (Item 6, \nat 2) Applicant was apparently confused, for he submitted documentation to indicate that \non July 1, 2019, he paid off three accounts with the balances of $48, $30, and $28. (Item \n2 (Receipt, dated July 1, 2019) The accounts with unpaid balances of $244 and $30 \nremain unpaid. \nDuring periods of financial difficulties, although Applicant claimed that he had \ninsufficient funds to maintain certain accounts in a current status, he managed to \npurchase jewelry for $3,000; a boat for $4,000; an automobile stereo set for about $3,000; \nand a truck for $36,000. (Item 6, at 12, 14-16)  \nOther than Applicant\u2019s unverified contentions regarding his expenses and his \nefforts to resolve certain delinquent accounts, there is no documentary evidence to \nsupport that Applicant made any efforts to address any of his delinquent accounts until \nJuly 1, 2019 \u2013 six months after the OPM interview and three weeks after the SOR was \nissued. With the exception of three relatively minor medical accounts ($48, $30, and $28), \nApplicant\u2019s delinquent accounts have not been resolved. \nIt is not known what Applicant\u2019s current financial resources may be because he did \nnot report his current net monthly income; monthly expenses; and any monthly remainder \nthat might be available for discretionary spending or savings. There is no evidence of a \nbudget. There is no evidence of financial counseling. In the absence of additional financial \ninformation, it remains difficult to determine if Applicant is currently in a better position \nfinancially than he had been.  \nPolicies \n \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the Executive \nBranch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security emphasizing, \n\u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d (Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. \n518, 528 (1988)) As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to control \naccess to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual \nis sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information. The President has \nauthorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant an applicant eligibility for \naccess to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to do so.\u201d (Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \nIndustry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified.)     \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the guidelines in SEAD 4. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the guidelines list potentially disqualifying \n\n \n5 \n                                      \n \nconditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility \nfor access to classified information. \n \nAn administrative judge need not view the guidelines as inflexible, ironclad rules \nof law. Instead, acknowledging the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. The entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known \nas the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a meaningful decision. \n \nIn the decision-making process, facts must be established by \u201csubstantial \nevidence.\u201d \u201cSubstantial evidence [is] such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might \naccept as adequate to support a conclusion in light of all contrary evidence in the record.\u201d  \n(ISCR Case No. 04-11463 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2006) (citing Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1))  \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d  (See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994)) \n \nThe Government initially has the burden of producing evidence to establish a \npotentially disqualifying condition under the Directive, and has the burden of establishing \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Once the Government has produced substantial \nevidence of a disqualifying condition, under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant has the \nburden of persuasion to present evidence in refutation, explanation, extenuation or \nmitigation, sufficient to overcome the doubts raised by the Government\u2019s case. The \nburden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government. (See ISCR \nCase No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005)) \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours as well. It is \nbecause of this special relationship that the Government must be able to repose a high \ndegree of trust and confidence in those individuals to whom it grants access to classified \ninformation. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the \napplicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. Such \ndecisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather \nthan actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Furthermore, \u201csecurity clearance \ndeterminations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d (Egan, 484 U.S. at 531) \n \nClearance decisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense \nbe a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d (See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 \n7) Thus, nothing in this decision should be construed to suggest that I have based this \ndecision, in whole or in part, on any express or implied determination as to Applicant\u2019s \nallegiance, loyalty, or patriotism. It is merely an indication the Applicant has or has not \nmet the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for \nissuing a clearance.  In reaching this decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that \n\n \n6 \n                                      \n \nare reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I \nhave avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG \u00b6 18:  \n      \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19:  \n \n(a) inability to satisfy debts;  \n \n(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so;  \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations.  \n \nThe SOR alleged 18 delinquent accounts totaling approximately $76,530. \nApplicant claimed that he had insufficient funds to maintain those accounts in a current \nstatus. As of the date the record closed, he had only resolved three minor medical debts \nwith a total payment of only $106, and a credit-card account has a zero balance. AG \u00b6\u00b6 \n19(a) and 19(c) have been established, but there is no evidence that Applicant has been \nunwilling to satisfy his debts regardless of an ability to do so, and AG \u00b6 19(b) has not \nbeen established.  \n \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns arising from financial difficulties under AG \u00b6 20: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n\n \n7 \n                                      \n \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; and \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \n  \nAG \u00b6 20(b) minimally applies, but none of the other conditions apply. A debt that \nbecame delinquent several years ago is still considered recent because \u201can applicant\u2019s \nongoing, unpaid debts evidence a continuing course of conduct and, therefore, can be \nviewed as recent for purposes of the Guideline F mitigating conditions.\u201d ISCR Case No. \n15-06532 at 3 (App. Bd. Feb. 16, 2017) (citing ISCR Case No. 15-01690 at 2 (App. Bd. \nSept. 13, 2016)). The nature, frequency, and recency of Applicant\u2019s continuing financial \ndifficulties, and his failure to voluntarily and timely resolve his delinquent accounts for \nseveral years, make it rather easy to conclude that it was not infrequent and it is likely to \nremain unchanged, much like it has been for several years. Applicant has attempted to \nattribute his financial problems to his two failed marriages; his disability; and having \ninsufficient funds. He also referred to a hurricane in mid-September 2018, after which he \nreportedly lost all of his bills and property, and/or he lost track of everything. But, it should \nbe noted that even before the hurricane, Applicant made no efforts to address his \ndelinquent debts. It is also troubling that although Applicant claimed that he had \ninsufficient funds to maintain his accounts in a current status, he managed to spend \nsignificant sums on jewelry, a boat, an automobile stereo set, and a truck. \n \nAn applicant who begins to resolve his financial problems only after being placed \non notice that his or her security clearance is in jeopardy may be lacking in the judgment \nand self-discipline to follow rules and regulations over time or when there is no immediate \nthreat to his or her own interests. (See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 17-01213 at 5 (App. Bd. Jun. \n29, 2018); ISCR Case No. 17-00569 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Sept. 18, 2018). Applicant \ncompleted his SF 86 in August 2018; underwent his OPM interview in January 2019; and \nthe SOR was issued in June 2019. Each step of the security clearance review process \nplaced him on notice of the significance of the financial issues confronting him. Applicant \npreviously stated that he would start calling his creditors at the beginning of February \n2019 in an effort to work on payment plans or possibly eliminate some of the interest on \nhis debts. His repayment plan was to address other debts first, and then start working on \nhis smaller debts before attempting to resolve the larger ones. Nevertheless, with \ndelinquent debts totaling approximately $76,530, throughout this entire process, \nApplicant failed to produce documentary evidence of any repayment plans, and he \nmanaged to resolve only three small debts totaling $106 approximately three weeks after \n\n \n8 \n                                      \n \nthe SOR was issued. One other account now has a zero balance, but Applicant is unable \nto express the reasons for the zero balance, and another account is no longer listed in \nhis July 2019 credit report. \n \nClearance decisions are aimed at evaluating an applicant\u2019s judgment, reliability, \nand trustworthiness. They are not a debt-collection procedure. The guidelines do not \nrequire an applicant to establish resolution of every debt or issue alleged in the SOR. An \napplicant needs only to establish a plan to resolve financial problems and take significant \nactions to implement the plan. There is no requirement that an applicant immediately \nresolve issues or make payments on all delinquent debts simultaneously, nor is there a \nrequirement that the debts or issues alleged in an SOR be resolved first. Rather, a \nreasonable plan and concomitant conduct may provide for the payment of such debts, or \nresolution of such issues, one at a time. Mere promises to pay debts in the future, without \nfurther confirmed action, are insufficient.  \nIt should be noted that the Appeal Board has indicated that promises to pay off \ndelinquent debts in the future are not a substitute for a track record of paying debts in a \ntimely manner and otherwise acting in a financially responsible manner. (ISCR Case No. \n07-13041 at 4 (App. Bd. Sept. 19, 2008) (citing ISCR Case No. 99-0012 at 3 (App. Bd. \nDec. 1, 1999)) In this instance, there is evidence, supported by documentation, that \nApplicant took some minimal corrective actions with respect to three delinquent medical \ndebts after the SOR was issued. There are also some unverified comments by Applicant \nthat he intended to resolve his delinquent accounts, but he offered no documentation to \nsupport his contentions. His contentions regarding the status of some accounts, and his \nunverified comments claiming that he had taken certain actions, without documents, to \nsupport his claims, are insufficient to reflect good-faith actions. The Appeal Board has \npreviously explained what constitutes a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \notherwise resolve debts: \nIn order to qualify for application of [the \u201cgood-faith\u201d mitigating condition], an \napplicant must present evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or some other good-faith action aimed at resolving the \napplicant\u2019s debts. The Directive does not define the term \u201cgood-faith.\u201d \nHowever, the Board has indicated that the concept of good-faith \u201crequires \na showing that a person acts in a way that shows reasonableness, \nprudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.\u201d Accordingly, an \napplicant must do more than merely show that he or she relied on a legally \navailable option (such as bankruptcy [or statute of limitations]) in order to \nclaim the benefit of [the \u201cgood-faith\u201d mitigating condition].  \n \n(internal citation and footnote omitted) ISCR Case No. 02-30304 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 20, \n2004) (quoting ISCR Case No. 99-9020 at 5-6 (App. Bd. Jun. 4, 2001). \n \nThere is no evidence of financial counseling or a budget. In the absence of \nadditional financial information, it remains difficult to determine if Applicant is currently in \na better position financially than he had been. Applicant\u2019s actions, or inaction, under the \n\n \n9 \n                                      \n \ncircumstances cast doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. \nSee ISCR Case No. 09-08533 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Oct. 6, 2010). \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6 2(d): \n  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nUnder SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. Moreover, I have \nevaluated the various aspects of this case in light of the totality of the record evidence \nand have not merely performed a piecemeal analysis. See U.S. v. Bottone, 365 F.2d 389, \n392 (2d Cir. 1966); see also ISCR Case No. 03-22861 at 2-3 (App. Bd. Jun. 2, 2006).  \n \nThere is some evidence in favor of mitigating Applicant\u2019s financial concerns. \nApplicant is a 32-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has been serving as a \nmechanic with his current employer since March 2018. He previously served as a \ndetention officer with the local sheriff\u2019s department from November 2016 until March \n2018, and also held part-time positions with auto parts stores from August 2015 until \nNovember 2016. A 2006 high school graduate, Applicant attended a local community \ncollege as a part-time student for a little over one year, and received some credits, but no \ndegree. He enlisted in the USMC in August 2006, and he served on active duty until he \nwas honorably and medically discharged as a sergeant (E-5), and awarded a 100 percent \ndisability. He was granted a secret clearance on an unspecified date. He paid off three \ndelinquent medical debts, totaling $106, approximately three weeks after the SOR was \nissued. \n \nThe disqualifying evidence under the whole-person concept is simply more \nsubstantial. Applicant had 18 delinquent accounts totaling approximately $76,530. Aside \nfrom the three minor medical debts that he paid, and one credit-card debt that now has a \nzero balance for an unspecified reason, all of his other delinquent debts remain \nunaddressed, despite Applicant\u2019s previously claimed intentions. Although Applicant \nclaimed that he had insufficient funds to maintain his accounts in a current status, he \nmanaged to spend significant sums on jewelry, a boat, an automobile stereo set, and a \ntruck. \n\n \n10 \n                                      \n \nIn ISCR Case No. 07-06482 at 2-3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008), the Appeal Board \naddressed a key element in the whole-person analysis in financial cases stating: \n \nIn evaluating Guideline F cases, the Board has previously noted that the \nconcept of \u201cmeaningful track record\u201d necessarily includes evidence of actual \ndebt reduction through payment of debts. However, an applicant is not \nrequired, as a matter of law, to establish that he [or she] has paid off each \nand every debt listed in the SOR. All that is required is that an applicant \ndemonstrate that he [or she] has \u201c. . . established a plan to resolve his [or \nher] financial problems and taken significant actions to implement that plan.\u201d \nThe Judge can reasonably consider the entirety of an applicant\u2019s financial \nsituation and his [or her] actions in evaluating the extent to which that \napplicant\u2019s plan for the reduction of his outstanding indebtedness is credible \nand realistic. See Directive \u00b6 E2.2(a) (\u201cAvailable, reliable information about \nthe person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, should be \nconsidered in reaching a determination.\u201d) There is no requirement that a \nplan provide for payments on all outstanding debts simultaneously. Rather, \na reasonable plan (and concomitant conduct) may provide for the payment \nof such debts one at a time. Likewise, there is no requirement that the first \ndebts actually paid in furtherance of a reasonable debt plan be the ones \nlisted in the SOR. \n \nThere is very little documentary evidence to indicate that most of Applicant\u2019s \ndelinquent accounts have been addressed. He finally paid off three accounts for $106 \nafter he received the SOR. Applicant\u2019s current track record is poor at best. Overall, the \nevidence leaves me with substantial questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and \nsuitability for a security clearance. For all of these reasons, I conclude Applicant has failed \nto mitigate the security concerns arising from his financial considerations. See SEAD 4, \nApp. A, \u00b6\u00b6 2(d)(1) through AG 2(d)(9). \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a. through 1.k., \n1.n., 1.p., and 1.r.:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.l., 1.m., 1.o.,  \nand 1.q.: \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \n\n \n11 \n                                      \n \nConclusion \n \n \n In light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n                                        \n         \n \n \n \n________________________ \nROBERT ROBINSON GALES \nAdministrative Judge \n",

    "summary": "Findings of Fact In her Answers to the SOR, Applicant admitted, with brief comments, nearly all of the SOR allegations pertaining to financial considerations (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a., 1.c. through 1.f., and 1.i. through 1.t.). However, while admitting that certain accounts remain unpaid as of the date of the SOR, she also provided contradictory evidence that a number of the accounts had already been paid well before the SOR was issued. Nevertheless, Applicant\u2019s admissions are incorporated herein as findings of fact. After a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, and upon due consideration of same, I make the following additional findings of fact: Background Applicant is a 62-year-old employee of a defense contractor. Her employment history is confusing because she erroneously listed incorrect dates or incorrect employers, and omitted one employer, in her SF 86. She has been serving as the contracts manager with her current employer since February 2018. She also has held a part-time job for over the past year. She received a bachelor\u2019s degree in 1990, and a master\u2019s degree in 1999. She has never served with the U.S. military. She was granted a secret clearance in 1996.

    "full_text": "1 \n______________ \n______________ \n   DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE \n DEFENSE OFFICE OF HEARINGS AND APPEALS \nIn the matter of: \n) \n) \n--- \n) \nISCR Case No. 19-01525 \n) \nApplicant for Security Clearance \n) \nAppearances \nFor Government: Gatha Manns, Esquire, Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro se \n12/30/2019\nDecision \nGALES, Robert Robinson, Administrative Judge: \nApplicant failed to mitigate the security concerns regarding financial \nconsiderations. Eligibility for a security clearance is denied. \nStatement of the Case \nOn March 21, 2017, Applicant applied for a security clearance and submitted a \nQuestionnaire for National Security Positions (SF 86). On June 7, 2019, the Department \nof Defense (DOD) Consolidated Adjudications Facility (CAF) issued a Statement of \nReasons (SOR) to her, under Executive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended and modified; DOD \nDirective 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program \n(January 2, 1992), as amended and modified (Directive); and Directive 4 of the Security \nExecutive Agent (SEAD 4), National Security Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) (December \n10, 2016), for all covered individuals who require initial or continued eligibility for access \nto classified information or eligibility to hold a sensitive position, effective June 8, 2017. \n The SOR alleged security concerns under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) \nand detailed reasons why the DOD adjudicators were unable to find that it is clearly \n\n \n2 \n                                      \n \nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant. \nThe SOR recommended referral to an administrative judge to determine whether a \nclearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked.  \n \n \nIn sworn statements dated June 26, 2019, and August 28, 2019, as well as with \nunsworn statements dated June 19, 2019, and August 5, 2019, Applicant responded to \nthe SOR, and she elected to have her case decided on the written record in lieu of a \nhearing. (Item 2)  A complete copy of the Government\u2019s file of relevant material (FORM) \nwas mailed to Applicant by the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) on \nOctober 21, 2019, and she was afforded an opportunity after receipt of the FORM to file \nobjections and submit material in refutation, extenuation, or mitigation. In addition to the \nFORM, Applicant was furnished a copy of the Directive as well as the Adjudicative \nGuidelines applicable to his case. Applicant received the FORM on October 29, 2019. \nHer response was due on November 28, 2019. Applicant timely submitted several \nstatements and documents which were accepted without objection. Embedded in her \nResponse to the FORM was a comment: \u201cIf the evidence I have supplied is not conclusive \nenough to show my worth as a person to hold a clearance then I request a hearing.\u201d A \nDOHA representative sought clarification, and on December 4, 2019, Applicant withdrew \nher request for a hearing and directed that her case be processed as originally directed, \non the written record in lieu of a hearing. The case was assigned to me on December 13, \n2019.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nIn her Answers to the SOR, Applicant admitted, with brief comments, nearly all of \nthe SOR allegations pertaining to financial considerations (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a., 1.c. through 1.f., \nand 1.i. through 1.t.). However, while admitting that certain accounts remain unpaid as of \nthe date of the SOR, she also provided contradictory evidence that a number of the \naccounts had already been paid well before the SOR was issued. Nevertheless, \nApplicant\u2019s admissions are incorporated herein as findings of fact. After a complete and \nthorough review of the evidence in the record, and upon due consideration of same, I \nmake the following additional findings of fact:  \n \nBackground \n \nApplicant is a 62-year-old employee of a defense contractor. Her employment \nhistory is confusing because she erroneously listed incorrect dates or incorrect \nemployers, and omitted one employer, in her SF 86. She has been serving as the \ncontracts manager with her current employer since February 2018. She also has held a \npart-time job for over the past year. She received a bachelor\u2019s degree in 1990, and a \nmaster\u2019s degree in 1999. She has never served with the U.S. military. She was granted \na secret clearance in 1996. She was married in 1979 and divorced in 1982.  She has two \nchildren, born in 1980 and 1999.  \n \n \n \n\n \n3 \n                                      \n \nFinancial Considerations  \n \nGeneral source information pertaining to the financial accounts discussed below \ncan be found in the following exhibits: Item 5 (Combined Experian, TransUnion, and \nEquifax Credit Report, dated July 1, 2017); Item 4 (Equifax Credit Report, dated April 26, \n2019); Item 6 (Enhanced Subject Interview, dated December 28, 2018); and Item 2 \n(Applicant\u2019s Answers to SOR, dated July 16, 2019).  \nAfter being interviewed by an investigator from the U.S. Office of Personnel \nManagement (OPM) in December 2018, some of Applicant\u2019s earlier employment history \ndiscrepancies were corrected. She claimed that she was working for one particular \nemployer and earning an annual salary of $80,000 until she was laid off as part of a \ncompany-wide layoff in June 2013. She stated that she worked in a temporary position \nwith another employer for two months. That was followed by a period that saw non-hiring, \na 2013 sequestration, and finally a 16-day government shutdown in October 2013. She \nremained unemployed until July 2014. Although Applicant received $268 per week in \nunemployment compensation, and she cashed out her 401k resulting in a $20,000 \npenalty, she still did not have sufficient funds to maintain her accounts in a current status.  \n(Item 3, at 17-18; Item 6, at 4-5) Applicant attributed her financial problems to being a \nsingle mother; living in a one-income household; her period of unemployment; her father\u2019s \nillness and death in 2014; her son\u2019s college needs; and her daughter was almost ready \nto attend college. (Item 2; Item 3)  \nWhen Applicant completed her SF 86 in March 2017, she acknowledged having \none delinquent automobile-loan account, and while she specifically denied having other \ndelinquent accounts, she did acknowledge that she was in the process of seeking help in \nnegotiating payoffs of her credit cards and loans. She indicated that she was dealing with \na company that was taking $500 from each paycheck to assist her in resolving her various \naccounts. (Item 3, at 36-38) During her OPM interview she reported that her relationship \nwith the company started in July 2015 and ended in February 2017, and that during that \nperiod, \u201ca lot of her delinquent accounts were satisfied.\u201d On June 25, 2019, nearly three \nweeks after the SOR was issued, Applicant asked the company for a report as to its \nactivities because none of her credit reports reflected that accounts had been resolved. \n(Item 2 attachment) She did not submit any documents such as receipts, cancelled \nchecks, bank account registers, or an official breakdown or report from the company to \nsupport her contention that specific delinquent accounts had been satisfied. She also \nacknowledged that her annual salary was back to $80,000. (Item 6, at 4-5)  \nThe SOR alleged 20 delinquent accounts totaling approximately $50,000, of which \nApplicant contended that she had either set up a repayment plan; agreed to a \ngarnishment; will soon start to begin paying; is paying; or has already paid off the account, \nset forth as follows: SOR \u00b6 1.a.: an automobile loan with a high credit of $30,623 of which \n$10,953 was charged off in May 2016 after the vehicle was repossessed; SOR \u00b6 1.c.: a \nnote loan with an unpaid balance of $5,398; SOR \u00b6 1.d.: a bank credit-card account that \nwas charged off in the amount of $4,296; SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.e. and 1.l.: two charge accounts with \nthe same creditor that were charged off in the amounts of $2,461 in February 2017, and \n$1,910 in March 2017, with unpaid balances of $1,445 and $2,181; SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.i., and 1.r. \n\n \n4 \n                                      \n \nthrough 1.t.: medical accounts with unpaid balances of $56, $250, $155, and $52; SOR \u00b6 \n1.j.: an unspecified type of account with an unpaid balance of $8,017, of which $5,089 is \nat least 120 days past due; SOR \u00b6 1.k.: an unspecified type of account that was charged \noff in the amount of $4,432; SOR \u00b6 1.m.: a charge account with an unpaid balance of \n$1,081 that was charged off in December 2016; SOR \u00b6\u00b6  1.n. through 1.p.: and three \ncredit-card accounts with the same bank with unpaid balances of $887, $459, and $402. \n(Item 4, at 2-3; Item 5, at 6-9, 17; Item 2) \nApplicant submitted a five-page spreadsheet with her Answer to the SOR which \nappears to set forth numerous financial transactions between June 2016 and February \n2018 with the company she had reportedly engaged in assisting her to resolve her \ndelinquent accounts. This is confusing, for Applicant claimed that the relationship ended \nin February 2017. Aside from guessing the accounts to which payments was made, \nwithout any comments or explanations from Applicant, it is nearly impossible to determine \nif any of the alleged accounts alleged in the SOR have actually had a repayment plan \nestablished; payments have commenced; accounts are in the process of being paid; or if \nany account has in fact been paid off. (Item 2, undated attachment) There are, however, \nthree accounts that appear to have been resolved, not through any evidence submitted \nby Applicant, but rather by a close scrutiny of Item 4 submitted by the Government. The \naccount alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.c. above was actually refinanced, and as of April 2019, it had \na zero balance. (Item 4, at 3) The two accounts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1. m. and 1.n. above \nwere both paid off for less than full balance, and they both had zero balances. (Item 4, at \n3) With the exception of these three accounts, there is insufficient evidence to support \nApplicant\u2019s contention that all of the above accounts were being addressed or have been \nresolved. \nIn addition to the above accounts, the SOR also alleged several delinquent \naccounts for which Applicant either denied responsibility; disputed responsibility; failed to \naddress; or simply had no information, set forth as follows: SOR \u00b6 1.b.: a joint account \nwith an unpaid balance of $8,368 for an assisted living facility where Applicant\u2019s mother \nresided for several months before being transferred to a nursing facility; SOR \u00b6 1.f.: an \nunspecified type of account with an unpaid balance of $448; SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.g. and 1.h.: two \nunspecified types of account with unpaid balances of $417 and $409 which were \npurchased by the same loan buyer; and SOR \u00b6 1.q.: a home security account with an \nunpaid balance of $1,433. (Item 4, at 2-3; Item 5, at 16; Item 2) Applicant contended that \nshe did not agree with the type of care the assisted living facility provided to her mother, \nso she moved her elsewhere. She failed to address the issue of the account being a joint \naccount for which she is also responsible. She claimed to be unaware of the two \npurchased accounts. She was unhappy with the home security account because the \nservice failed to work properly. She claimed to be unaware that the one remaining account \nfor $448 was unpaid, and promised to pay it. (Item 2; Response to the FORM)  \nOther than Applicant\u2019s unverified contentions regarding her expenses, \ngarnishments, and payments made, or any of her efforts to resolve certain delinquent \naccounts, there is no documentary evidence to support that Applicant, or the company \nshe engaged to assist her, made any efforts to address her delinquent accounts after \nFebruary 2017, the date she claimed she no longer used them. The five-page \n\n \n5 \n                                      \n \nspreadsheet is essentially useless because there were no comments or directions from \nher regarding if any of the payments were made to identified creditors. With the exception \nof the three accounts that were apparently resolved either through refinance or settlement \nand payment for less than full balance, as reflected in Item 4, Applicant\u2019s delinquent \naccounts have not been resolved. \nAlthough Applicant claims, without verification, that she now has an annual income \nof $80,000, it is not known what Applicant\u2019s current financial resources may be because \nshe did not report her current net monthly income; monthly expenses; and any monthly \nremainder that might be available for discretionary spending or savings. There is no \nevidence of a budget. While there is some evidence of a financial relationship with the \ncompany that reportedly assisted her, there is no evidence of financial counseling. In the \nabsence of additional financial information, it remains difficult to determine if Applicant is \ncurrently in a better position financially than she had been.  \nCharacter References \n \nThe president of the corporation for which Applicant worked from October 2016 \nuntil February 2017, and then rejoined in February 2018, stated that Applicant has a \nstrong work ethic with exceptional working knowledge of government contracting and \nlogistics. Applicant tackles every task with a good attitude and always does in-depth \nresearch on any new or different task to assure that the regulatory guidance has not \nchanged. She currently serves as contract manager and facility security officer (FSO). As \nan FSO, Applicant has exceptional expertise and has always shown good judgment and \nan excellent work ethic. (Letter, dated November 18, 2019, attached to Response to the \nFORM) \n \nA retired senior contracts manager and the vice president, contracts and \nprocurement, of companies for which Applicant previously worked, offered equally \npositive assessments of her. Applicant was highly regarded for her knowledge of the \ncontractual requirements, deliverables requirements and funding status on each task \norder for which she was responsible. Her interface was consistently professional. She \nnever demonstrated anything but absolute candor, complete honesty and professional \nand reasonable behavior. (Letters, dated November 25, 2019, and November 26, 2019, \nattached to Response to the FORM) \n \nThe president, chief executive officer, and FSO of another company for which \nApplicant worked, and as a friend and colleague since 1987, stated that he has no doubts \nabout Applicant\u2019s character and trustworthiness in business, security or other matters \nconcerning her moral values and ethics. She has excellent judgment in life\u2019s decisions, \nalong with an extraordinary work ethic, and solid moral character. (Letter, dated \nNovember 18, 2019, attached to Response to the FORM) \n \nThe vice president and director of a community theatre has known Applicant since \nthey were in high school. She characterized Applicant as trustworthy, and noted that she \nvolunteers frequently on several community projects where she has worked tirelessly. \n(Letter, undated, attached to Response to the FORM) \n\n \n6 \n                                      \n \nPolicies \n \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the Executive \nBranch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security emphasizing, \n\u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d (Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. \n518, 528 (1988)) As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to control \naccess to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual \nis sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information. The President has \nauthorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant an applicant eligibility for \naccess to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to do so.\u201d (Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \nIndustry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified.)     \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the guidelines in SEAD 4. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the guidelines list potentially disqualifying \nconditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility \nfor access to classified information. \n \nAn administrative judge need not view the guidelines as inflexible, ironclad rules \nof law. Instead, acknowledging the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. The entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known \nas the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a meaningful decision. \n \nIn the decision-making process, facts must be established by \u201csubstantial \nevidence.\u201d \u201cSubstantial evidence [is] such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might \naccept as adequate to support a conclusion in light of all contrary evidence in the record.\u201d  \n(ISCR Case No. 04-11463 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2006) (citing Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1))  \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d  (See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994)) \n \nThe Government initially has the burden of producing evidence to establish a \npotentially disqualifying condition under the Directive, and has the burden of establishing \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Once the Government has produced substantial \nevidence of a disqualifying condition, under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant has the \nburden of persuasion to present evidence in refutation, explanation, extenuation or \nmitigation, sufficient to overcome the doubts raised by the Government\u2019s case. The \nburden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government. (See ISCR \nCase No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005)) \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours as well. It is \n\n \n7 \n                                      \n \nbecause of this special relationship that the Government must be able to repose a high \ndegree of trust and confidence in those individuals to whom it grants access to classified \ninformation. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the \napplicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. Such \ndecisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather \nthan actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Furthermore, \u201csecurity clearance \ndeterminations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d (Egan, 484 U.S. at 531) \n \nClearance decisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense \nbe a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d (See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 \n7) Thus, nothing in this decision should be construed to suggest that I have based this \ndecision, in whole or in part, on any express or implied determination as to Applicant\u2019s \nallegiance, loyalty, or patriotism. It is merely an indication the Applicant has or has not \nmet the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for \nissuing a clearance.  In reaching this decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that \nare reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I \nhave avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG \u00b6 18:  \n      \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19:  \n \n(a) inability to satisfy debts;  \n \n(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so; and \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations.  \n\n \n8 \n                                      \n \nThe SOR alleged 20 delinquent accounts totaling approximately $50,000. \nApplicant claimed that he had insufficient funds to maintain those accounts in a current \nstatus. As of the date the record closed, she had only resolved three delinquent debts for \nwhich resolution had been verified by documentation. AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and 19(c) have been \nestablished, but there is no evidence that Applicant has been unwilling to satisfy her debts \nregardless of an ability to do so, and AG \u00b6 19(b) has not been established.  \n \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns arising from financial difficulties under AG \u00b6 20: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; and \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \n  \nAG \u00b6 20(b) minimally applies, but none of the other conditions apply. A debt that \nbecame delinquent several years ago is still considered recent because \u201can applicant\u2019s \nongoing, unpaid debts evidence a continuing course of conduct and, therefore, can be \nviewed as recent for purposes of the Guideline F mitigating conditions.\u201d ISCR Case No. \n15-06532 at 3 (App. Bd. Feb. 16, 2017) (citing ISCR Case No. 15-01690 at 2 (App. Bd. \nSept. 13, 2016)). The nature, frequency, and recency of Applicant\u2019s continuing financial \ndifficulties, and her failure to voluntarily and timely resolve her delinquent accounts for \nseveral years, make it rather easy to conclude that it was not infrequent and it is likely to \nremain unchanged, much like it has been for several years. Applicant has attempted to \nattribute her financial problems to: being a single mother; living in a one-income \nhousehold; her period of unemployment; her father\u2019s illness and death in 2014; her son\u2019s \ncollege needs; and her daughter was almost ready to attend college. In the absence of \nexplanations and some documents addressing the reported impact on her finances that \nwere caused by her father\u2019s illness and death in 2014; her son\u2019s college needs; or why \nher daughter\u2019s anticipated college needs have negatively impacted her finances, it is \ndifficult to assess those issues. The sole significant verified issue that was largely beyond \nApplicant\u2019s control appears to be Applicant\u2019s period of unemployment from June 2013 \nuntil July 2014.  \n \n\n \n9 \n                                      \n \nApplicant ran up a number of delinquent accounts, and essentially ignored them \nuntil July 2015. What she and the company chosen to represent her did from that date \nuntil the relationship ended in February 2017 is unclear. Also unclear are her purported \nefforts to address delinquent accounts after February 2017, or what efforts continued until \nthe FORM was issued. Other than a confusing five-page spreadsheet with her Answer to \nthe SOR which appears to set forth numerous financial transactions with the company \nshe had reportedly engaged in assisting her to resolve her delinquent accounts, without \nany comments or explanations from Applicant, it is nearly impossible to determine if any \nof the alleged accounts alleged in the SOR have actually had a repayment plan \nestablished; payments have commenced; accounts are in the process of being paid; or if \nany account has in fact been paid off. \n \nAn applicant who begins to resolve his financial problems only after being placed \non notice that his or her security clearance is in jeopardy may be lacking in the judgment \nand self-discipline to follow rules and regulations over time or when there is no immediate \nthreat to his or her own interests. (See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 17-01213 at 5 (App. Bd. Jun. \n29, 2018); ISCR Case No. 17-00569 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Sept. 18, 2018). Applicant \ncompleted her SF 86 in March 2017; underwent her OPM interview in December 2018; \nand the SOR was issued in June 2019. Each step of the security clearance review \nprocess placed her on notice of the significance of the financial issues confronting her. \nApplicant contended that she had either set up a repayment plan; agreed to a \ngarnishment; will soon start to begin paying; is paying; or has already paid off an account. \nNevertheless, with delinquent debts totaling approximately $50,000, throughout this \nentire process, Applicant failed to produce documentary evidence of any of the actions \nshe claimed she or the company had taken.  \n \nClearance decisions are aimed at evaluating an applicant\u2019s judgment, reliability, \nand trustworthiness. They are not a debt-collection procedure. The guidelines do not \nrequire an applicant to establish resolution of every debt or issue alleged in the SOR. An \napplicant needs only to establish a plan to resolve financial problems and take significant \nactions to implement the plan. There is no requirement that an applicant immediately \nresolve issues or make payments on all delinquent debts simultaneously, nor is there a \nrequirement that the debts or issues alleged in an SOR be resolved first. Rather, a \nreasonable plan and concomitant conduct may provide for the payment of such debts, or \nresolution of such issues, one at a time. Mere promises to pay debts in the future, without \nfurther confirmed action, are insufficient. Likewise, unverified contentions of actions \npurportedly taken, are insufficient. \nIt should be noted that the Appeal Board has indicated that promises to pay off \ndelinquent debts in the future are not a substitute for a track record of paying debts in a \ntimely manner and otherwise acting in a financially responsible manner. (ISCR Case No. \n07-13041 at 4 (App. Bd. Sept. 19, 2008) (citing ISCR Case No. 99-0012 at 3 (App. Bd. \nDec. 1, 1999)) In this instance, there is some verified evidence, supported by \ndocumentation, that Applicant took some corrective actions with respect to three \ndelinquent debts, but when those actions were taken is unclear. There are also some \nunverified comments by Applicant that she intended to resolve her remaining delinquent \naccounts, but she offered no documentation to support her contentions. Her contentions \n\n \n10 \n                                      \n \nregarding the status of some accounts, and her unverified comments claiming that she \nhad taken certain actions, without documents, to support her claims, are insufficient to \nreflect good-faith actions. The Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a \ngood-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts: \nIn order to qualify for application of [the \u201cgood-faith\u201d mitigating condition], an \napplicant must present evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or some other good-faith action aimed at resolving the \napplicant\u2019s debts. The Directive does not define the term \u201cgood-faith.\u201d \nHowever, the Board has indicated that the concept of good-faith \u201crequires \na showing that a person acts in a way that shows reasonableness, \nprudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.\u201d Accordingly, an \napplicant must do more than merely show that he or she relied on a legally \navailable option (such as bankruptcy [or statute of limitations]) in order to \nclaim the benefit of [the \u201cgood-faith\u201d mitigating condition].  \n \n(internal citation and footnote omitted) ISCR Case No. 02-30304 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 20, \n2004) (quoting ISCR Case No. 99-9020 at 5-6 (App. Bd. Jun. 4, 2001). \n \nThere is no evidence of financial counseling or a budget. In the absence of \nadditional financial information, it remains difficult to determine if Applicant is currently in \na better position financially than she had been. Applicant\u2019s actions, or inaction, under the \ncircumstances cast doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. \nSee ISCR Case No. 09-08533 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Oct. 6, 2010). \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6 2(d): \n  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nUnder SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. Moreover, I have \nevaluated the various aspects of this case in light of the totality of the record evidence \nand have not merely performed a piecemeal analysis. See U.S. v. Bottone, 365 F.2d 389, \n392 (2d Cir. 1966); see also ISCR Case No. 03-22861 at 2-3 (App. Bd. Jun. 2, 2006).  \n\n \n11 \n                                      \n \nThere is some evidence in favor of mitigating Applicant\u2019s financial concerns. \nApplicant is a 62-year-old employee of a defense contractor. She has been serving as \nthe contracts manager with her current employer since February 2018. She also has held \na part-time job for over the past year. She received a bachelor\u2019s degree in 1990, and a \nmaster\u2019s degree in 1999. She was granted a secret clearance in 1996. She has a \nreputation for trustworthiness and excellent judgment in life\u2019s decisions, along with \nextraordinary work ethic, and solid moral character.  \nThe disqualifying evidence under the whole-person concept is simply more \nsubstantial. Applicant had 20 delinquent accounts totaling approximately $50,000. Aside \nfrom the three delinquent debts that were resolved, the status of all of her other delinquent \ndebts remain unclear, despite Applicant\u2019s previously claimed intentions and actions. \nSimply contending that an account has been resolved, without documentation to support \nthe contention, is insufficient to prove the status of the account. \nIn ISCR Case No. 07-06482 at 2-3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008), the Appeal Board \naddressed a key element in the whole-person analysis in financial cases stating: \nIn evaluating Guideline F cases, the Board has previously noted that the \nconcept of \u201cmeaningful track record\u201d necessarily includes evidence of actual \ndebt reduction through payment of debts. However, an applicant is not \nrequired, as a matter of law, to establish that he [or she] has paid off each \nand every debt listed in the SOR. All that is required is that an applicant \ndemonstrate that he [or she] has \u201c. . . established a plan to resolve his [or \nher] financial problems and taken significant actions to implement that plan.\u201d \nThe Judge can reasonably consider the entirety of an applicant\u2019s financial \nsituation and his [or her] actions in evaluating the extent to which that \napplicant\u2019s plan for the reduction of his outstanding indebtedness is credible \nand realistic. See Directive \u00b6 E2.2(a) (\u201cAvailable, reliable information about \nthe person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, should be \nconsidered in reaching a determination.\u201d) There is no requirement that a \nplan provide for payments on all outstanding debts simultaneously. Rather, \na reasonable plan (and concomitant conduct) may provide for the payment \nof such debts one at a time. Likewise, there is no requirement that the first \ndebts actually paid in furtherance of a reasonable debt plan be the ones \nlisted in the SOR. \n \nThere is very little documentary evidence to indicate that most of Applicant\u2019s \ndelinquent accounts have been addressed. Three accounts were resolved, but when is \nunclear. Applicant\u2019s current track record is poor at best. Overall, the evidence leaves me \nwith substantial questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a \nsecurity clearance. For all of these reasons, I conclude Applicant has failed to mitigate \nthe security concerns arising from her financial considerations. See SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6\u00b6 \n2(d)(1) through AG 2(d)(9). \n \n \n \n\n \n12 \n                                      \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.c., 1.m., \nand 1.n.: \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a., 1.b., 1.d. through\n1.l., and 1.o. through 1.t.:  \n  \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \n In light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

Eligibility for access to classified \ninformation is granted. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nApplicant submitted a security clearance application (SCA) on July 19, 2017. On \nJune 21, 2019, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications Facility (DOD \nCAF) sent him a Statement of Reasons (SOR) alleging security concerns under \nGuidelines F and E. The DOD CAF acted under Executive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; \nDOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program \n(January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) effective \non June 8, 2017. \n \nApplicant responded to the SOR on July 5, 2019, and requested a hearing before \nan administrative judge. The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals issued a notice of \nhearing on August 20, 2019, for a scheduled hearing on September 13, 2019. Applicant \n\n \n2 \n \nfailed to appear at the scheduled hearing, claiming that he did not receive the notice of \nhearing despite discussion of the hearing with Department Counsel, and that he had to \ntravel to another state to visit his ill grandmother. After submitting information explaining \nhis failure to appear, a new notice of hearing was sent on October 9, 2019, scheduling a \nhearing by video teleconference on October 23, 2019. The hearing was convened as \nscheduled.  \n \nApplicant claimed at the hearing that he did not receive the Government\u2019s exhibits \nthat Department Counsel stated that he mailed to Applicant, and discussed with him \nduring a pre-hearing telephone conference. The hearing was paused while Department \nCounsel emailed the Government\u2019s exhibits to Applicant, and he was provided an \nopportunity to review them prior to continuing with the hearing. Despite a delay in \nreceiving the SCA via email, Applicant agreed to proceed with the hearing. Applicant \nobjected to the authenticity of an interview summary prepared by a government \ninvestigator, and Department Counsel did not present authenticating evidence. The \nobjection was sustained and the interview summary was not admitted into evidence. \nGovernment Exhibits (GE) 1 through 3, including Applicant\u2019s signed SCA and two credit \nreports were admitted into evidence without objection. Department Counsel\u2019s discovery \nletter and summary of exhibits were marked as hearing exhibits (HE) 1 and 2, and \nappended to the record. Applicant testified at the hearing. The record was held open for \nApplicant to submit any documentary evidence in mitigation. He submitted an e-mail \n(without attachments) from a credit repair company. This exhibit was marked as Applicant \nExhibit (AE) A, and admitted into evidence without objection. DOHA received the hearing \ntranscript on October 31, 2019. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant is a 33-year-old alarm monitor for a defense contractor, employed since \n2017. He was previously employed by defense contractors and held security clearances \nin 2012 and 2014. Applicant graduated from high school in 2006 and completed some \ncollege credits. He was married in 2009, but they separated and Applicant moved out of \nthe home in 2015. Applicant is in the process of obtaining a divorce and self-started child \nsupport payments once he left the home. Applicant filed for divorce, but his spouse would \nnot cooperate and the process is currently pending. He has one eight-year-old child and \none deceased child. He does not currently hold a security clearance.  \n \n \nThe SOR alleges under Guideline F, that Applicant has nine delinquent debts \ntotaling about $19,742. The debts include a vehicle loan, two credit cards, medical debts, \nand a small collection account. Additionally, the SOR alleges, under Guideline E, that \nApplicant failed to report his delinquent financial accounts when he completed his SCA \non July 19, 2017. Applicant admitted the auto loan and a credit card debt, but denied the \nremaining debts and the Guideline E falsification allegation. He provided documentary \nevidence with his Answer (Ans.) to the SOR of several accounts removed from his credit \nreport. \n \n\n \n3 \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.a is a delinquent joint auto loan by Applicant and his spouse, incurred in \n2015 to provide his spouse with a vehicle. After they separated, she was to continue with \nthe loan payments, but she defaulted on the loan in 2017 and the vehicle was \nrepossessed. Applicant was unaware of the defaulted loan until he spoke to a government \ninvestigator after completing his SCA. As a result, he discussed the loan with the creditor \nin 2018, but was advised by his financial counselor to refrain from paying this and other \ndebts because of the potential negative impact on his pending divorce settlement. The \ncreditor has charged off the debt.  \n \n \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b and 1.f are credit card accounts opened in early 2015 by Applicant\u2019s \nspouse without his knowledge. They became delinquent in December 2015 and January \n2016. Applicant contacted the credit union holding the largest debt ($4,238) and notified \nthem that the account was fraudulently opened by his spouse without his knowledge, but \nhe was incorrectly told that he remains responsible because they were married. The \naccount was charged off by the creditor and is no longer in a collection status. The second \ndebt, for $718, was charged off by the creditor, and referred to a collection agent. \nApplicant was unaware of the debts when he completed his SCA, and he disputed them, \nbut they remain on his credit report. \n \n \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c, 1.d, 1.e, 1.g, and 1.i are past-due medical accounts totaling $3,646. \nApplicant was in a car accident and incurred various medical debts that he contends \nshould have been paid by his insurance carrier. Applicant was unaware of the debts when \nhe completed his SCA, and disputed them with the credit reporting agencies once he \nlearned of them. As a result of the dispute, they were removed from his credit report. \n(Ans.) \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.h is a collection account for $319 by a cable provider. Applicant was \nunaware of the debt when he completed his SCA, and testified that he has a current \naccount with the same cable provider. He intends to dispute the account now that he is \naware of the original creditor. \n \n \nApplicant has a small amount in savings, and owns a car that is paid off. He sought \nadvice from a credit counselor in 2019. The counselor assisted him with removing \ndisputed accounts and advised him to refrain from undertaking payments on fraudulent \naccounts or the joint car loan that his spouse defaulted on because of the negative impact \nit would have on his divorce proceedings. He testified that he is a good employee and \nlives within his means. When he left his marital home in 2015, he took responsibility to \npay his child support obligations, and he never carried any delinquent debts in the past. \n \n \nPolicies \n \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \n\n \n4 \n \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 2. \n \nNational security eligibility is predicated upon the applicant meeting the criteria \ncontained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. \nInstead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge applies \nthese guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative \njudge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider a person\u2019s stability, trustworthiness, reliability, \ndiscretion, character, honesty, and judgment. AG \u00b6 1(b). \n \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865  \n\u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \n \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \u201cSubstantial \nevidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. Washington \nMetro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines presume a \nnexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria listed \ntherein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 12-01295 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Jan. 20, 2015). \n \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, \nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. \n02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \n \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01- \n20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see, AG \u00b6 1(d). \n \n\n \n5 \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \n \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. . . .  \n \nThe relevant disqualifying conditions under AG \u00b6 19 include: \n \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \n \nApplicant\u2019s admissions, testimony, and the documentary evidence in the record \nare sufficient to establish the disqualifying conditions AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and (c). \n \nThe following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially relevant: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue. \n \n\n \n6 \n \nApplicant incurred debts that were beyond his control. The car loan was a joint \naccount but Applicant\u2019s spouse was to pay the loan when they separated. Although \nApplicant remains responsible for the debt as a joint borrower, he was advised to refrain \nfrom paying the debt until his divorce is resolved. The account has been charged off, and \nthe creditor is not actively collecting on it. The credit card debts were fraudulently incurred \nwhen Applicant\u2019s spouse opened the accounts without his knowledge. He disputed the \ndebts and the largest was charged off, while the smaller debt remains with a collection \nagent. The medical debts were disputed and should have been paid by Applicant\u2019s \ninsurance carrier. They were removed from his credit report. A small cable company \ncollection account will be disputed now that Applicant is aware of the original creditor. \n \nApplicant has taken responsible action to address his debts, and has legitimately \ndisputed debts for which he is not responsible. He has made responsible financial \ndecisions in the past, and incurred debts as a result of his separation and improper actions \nof his spouse. Applicant has received advice from a financial counselor and has worked \nto correct his financial record. There are clear indications that his financial problems are \nresolved or being resolved, and his financial status is under control. I find that continued \nfinancial delinquencies are unlikely to recur and his financial status does not cast doubt \non his current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment. Mitigating conditions in AG \n\u00b6\u00b6 20(a) through (e) apply. \n \nGuideline E: Personal Conduct \n \nThe security concern for personal conduct is set out in AG \u00b6 15, as follows: \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. \n \n  \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. The following disqualifying condition is potentially applicable: \n \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar \nform used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, \naward benefits or status, determine national security eligibility or \ntrustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities. \n \n \nWhen falsification allegations are controverted, as here, the Government has the \nburden of proving the allegations. An omission, standing alone, does not prove \nfalsification. An administrative judge must consider the record evidence as a whole to \ndetermine an applicant\u2019s state of mind at the time of the omission. (See ISCR Case No. \n03-09483 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 17, 2004)) An applicant\u2019s level of education and business \n\n \n7 \n \nexperience are relevant to determining whether a failure to disclose relevant information \non a security clearance application was deliberate. (ISCR Case No. 08-05637 (App. Bd. \nSep. 9, 2010)) \n \n  \nApplicant did not report his delinquent debts on his SCA because he was unaware \nof them after separating with his spouse and leaving the family home in 2015. He denied \nintentionally falsifying his SCA, and satisfactorily explained the circumstances of the debts \nfor which he became aware of, after completing his SCA. I find that based on Applicant\u2019s \nanswer and testimony, his failure to report the SOR debts on his SCA was not intentional. \nHe provided plausible explanations for his omissions, and intentional falsification is not \nsupported by the evidence. AG \u00b6 16(a) is not applicable to SOR \u00b6 2.a. The personal \nconduct security concern is concluded for Applicant. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6\u00b6 2(a), 2(c), and 2(d), the ultimate determination of whether to grant \nnational security eligibility must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. Under the whole-person \nconcept, the administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security \nclearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process \nfactors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d). \n \n \nI considered all of the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my findings of fact \nand comments under Guidelines F and E, in my whole-person analysis. I believe \nApplicant adequately explained his financial situation, and despite the debts incurred as \na result of his separation and improper actions of his spouse, his financial decision-\nmaking is sound and responsible. He has not incurred additional debts since his \nseparation, and is in the process of concluding his divorce.  \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude Applicant mitigated \nthe financial consideration security concerns and the allegation of falsification is \nunfounded. Accordingly, I conclude Applicant has carried his burden of showing that it is \nclearly consistent with the national security interests of the United States to grant him \neligibility for access to classified information. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n8 \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n  Subparagraphs 1.a to 1.i:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \n \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n  Subparagraph 2.a:  \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \nI conclude that it is clearly consistent with the national security interest of the United \nStates to grant Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.

Apostol, Esquire, Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro se \n10/04/2019\nDecision \nGALES, Robert Robinson, Administrative Judge: \nApplicant failed to mitigate the security concerns regarding drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse. Eligibility for a security clearance is denied. \nStatement of the Case \nOn December 12, 2017, Applicant applied for a security clearance and submitted \nan Electronic Questionnaires for Investigations Processing (e-QIP) version of a Security \nClearance Application. On June 7, 2018, the Department of Defense (DOD) Consolidated \nAdjudications Facility (CAF) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to him, under \nExecutive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry \n(February 20, 1960), as amended and modified; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense \nIndustrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended \nand modified (Directive); and Directive 4 of the Security Executive Agent (SEAD 4), \nNational Security Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) (December 10, 2016) for all covered \nindividuals who require initial or continued eligibility for access to classified information or \neligibility to hold a sensitive position, effective June 8, 2017. \n\n \n2 \n                                      \n \nThe SOR alleged security concerns under Guideline H (Drug Involvement and \nSubstance Misuse), and detailed reasons why the DOD adjudicators were unable to find \nthat it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security \nclearance for Applicant. The SOR recommended referral to an administrative judge to \ndetermine whether a clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked.  \n \n \nIn a notarized statement dated June 26, 2019, Applicant responded to the SOR \nand elected to have his case decided on the written record in lieu of a hearing. A complete \ncopy of the Government\u2019s file of relevant material (FORM) was mailed to Applicant by the \nDefense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) on July 16, 2019, and he was afforded \nan opportunity, within a period of 30 days, to file objections and submit material in \nrefutation, extenuation, or mitigation. In addition to the FORM, Applicant was furnished a \ncopy of the Directive as well as the Adjudicative Guidelines applicable to his case. \nApplicant received the FORM on July 25, 2019. His response was due on August 24, \n2019. Applicant timely submitted two documents in response to the FORM, and they were \nadmitted without objection. The case was assigned to me on September 6, 2019.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nIn his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted, with comments, both of the factual \nallegations pertaining to drug involvement and substance misuse (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a. and 1.b.). \nApplicant\u2019s admissions and accompanying comments are incorporated herein as findings \nof fact. After a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, and upon due \nconsideration of same, I make the following additional findings of fact:  \n \nApplicant is a 35-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has been serving \nas a project manager with his current employer since March 2011. A 2002 high school \ngraduate, Applicant received a bachelor\u2019s degree in 2013. He enlisted in the U.S. Navy \nin July 2002, and served on active duty until February 2008, when he was medically \ndischarged under honorable conditions, with no reserve obligation. He was granted a \nsecret clearance in 2008, and that clearance has remained active. Applicant was married \nin 2007, and he has two children, born in 2011 and 2013.  \n \nDrug Involvement and Substance Misuse \n \n \nApplicant was a recreational substance abuser whose substance of choice was \nmarijuana. He commenced what he called a \u201cminor level of participation\u201d as well as \n\u201climited and infrequent\u201d use of marijuana during the Christmas holiday in about December \n2010, when he was 26 years old, and he continued his use until at least May 2016, when \nhe was 32 years old, at a bachelor party of a close friend. In each instance, his marijuana \nuse occurred during a vacation, or while attending a social gathering. Applicant never \npurchased the marijuana or carried it anywhere, for it was always provided by someone \nelse during those gatherings. He denied ever using marijuana while carrying out his \nprofessional responsibilities; that he ever failed a random drug screening; or that his \nmarijuana use ever resulted in any disciplinary action or criminal charges. (Item 1 (Answer \nto the SOR), at 2; Item 2, at 33; Item 3, at 2)  \n\n \n3 \n                                      \n \nMarijuana made Applicant feel relaxed. Nevertheless, at some point, Applicant \nclaimed that he decided that he no longer had the time or the desire to continue using \nmarijuana, and continued use did not align with his career or developmental goals. (Item \n2, at 34; Item 3, at 2; Item 1, at 2) Applicant voluntarily reported his marijuana use to his \nfacility security officer (FSO) when he was completing his 2017 e-QIP. (Item 3, at 2) When \nApplicant completed his 2017 e-QIP, he acknowledged his past drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse. (Item 2, at 33-34) \n \nApplicant denied knowing the significance of using any illegal drug while granted \naccess to classified information, and he contends that his marijuana use while holding his \nsecurity clearance was done \u201cin ignorance.\u201d (Response to the FORM) Now that he is \naware of that information, Applicant submitted a signed statement of intent to abstain from \nall drug involvement and substance misuse, and he has acknowledged that any future \ninvolvement or misuse will result in the automatic revocation of his security clearance \neligibility. (Statement of Intent, attached to his Response to the FORM) Applicant claims \nthat he has been drug free since May 2016, and that he has ended his relationships with \nhis drug-using friends and relatives. There is no evidence to indicate that Applicant has \never received counseling or treatment as a result of his illegal use of drugs or controlled \nsubstances.  \n \nPolicies \n \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the Executive \nBranch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security emphasizing, \n\u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d (Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. \n518, 528 (1988)) As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to control \naccess to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual \nis sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information. The President has \nauthorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant an applicant eligibility for \naccess to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to do so.\u201d (Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \nIndustry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified.)      \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the guidelines in SEAD 4. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the guidelines list potentially disqualifying \nconditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility \nfor access to classified information. \n \nAn administrative judge need not view the guidelines as inflexible, ironclad rules \nof law. Instead, acknowledging the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. The entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known \nas the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a meaningful decision. \n\n \n4 \n                                      \n \nIn the decision-making process, facts must be established by \u201csubstantial \nevidence.\u201d \u201cSubstantial evidence [is] such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might \naccept as adequate to support a conclusion in light of all contrary evidence in the record.\u201d  \n(ISCR Case No. 04-11463 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2006) (citing Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1)).  \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d  (See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994).) \n \n The Government initially has the burden of producing evidence to establish a \npotentially disqualifying condition under the Directive, and has the burden of establishing \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Once the Government has produced substantial \nevidence of a disqualifying condition, under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant has the \nburden of persuasion to present evidence in refutation, explanation, extenuation or \nmitigation, sufficient to overcome the doubts raised by the Government\u2019s case. The \nburden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government. (See ISCR \nCase No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).) \n  \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours as well. It is \nbecause of this special relationship that the Government must be able to repose a high \ndegree of trust and confidence in those individuals to whom it grants access to classified \ninformation. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the \napplicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. Such \ndecisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather \nthan actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Furthermore, \u201csecurity clearance \ndeterminations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d (Egan, 484 U.S. at 531) \n \nClearance decisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense \nbe a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d (See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 \n7)  Thus, nothing in this decision should be construed to suggest that I have based this \ndecision, in whole or in part, on any express or implied determination as to Applicant\u2019s \nallegiance, loyalty, or patriotism. It is merely an indication the Applicant has or has not \nmet the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for \nissuing a clearance.  In reaching this decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that \nare reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I \nhave avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline H, Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Drug Involvement and Substance \nAbuse is set out in AG \u00b6 24:       \n \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \n\n \n5 \n                                      \n \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual's reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior may \nlead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. Controlled substance means any \"controlled substance\" as \ndefined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term adopted in \nthis guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above. \n \nFurthermore, on October 25, 2014, the Director of National Intelligence (DNI) \nissued Memorandum ES 2014-00674, Adherence to Federal Laws Prohibiting Marijuana \nUse, which states: \n \n[C]hanges to state laws and the laws of the District of Columbia pertaining \nto marijuana use do not alter the existing National Security Adjudicative \nGuidelines (Reference H and I). An individual's disregard of federal law \npertaining to the use, sale, or manufacture of marijuana remains \nadjudicatively relevant in national security determinations. As always, \nadjudicative authorities are expected to evaluate claimed or developed use \nof, or involvement with, marijuana using the current adjudicative criteria. \nThe adjudicative authority must determine if the use of, or involvement with, \nmarijuana raises questions about the individual's judgment, reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and willingness to comply with law, rules, and regulations, \nincluding federal laws, when making eligibility decisions of persons \nproposed for, or occupying, sensitive national security positions. \n \nThe guideline notes two conditions under AG \u00b6 25 that could raise security \nconcerns in this case:  \n \n(a) any substance misuse (see above definition); and \n \n(f) any illegal drug use while granted access to classified information or \nholding a sensitive position.  \n \nApplicant admittedly used marijuana between December 2010 and May 2016, \ndescribing the frequency of such use as \u201cminor level of participation\u201d as well as \u201climited \nand infrequent\u201d use. He held a security clearance from 2008 until the present day. \nApplicant\u2019s argument that he was ignorant of the significance of using illegal drugs while \nholding a security clearance cannot be given much weight. AG \u00b6\u00b6 25(a), and 25(f) have \nbeen established. \n \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions under AG \u00b6 26 that could \nmitigate security concerns arising from Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse:  \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; and \n \n\n \n6 \n                                      \n \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and substance \nmisuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and \nhas established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not limited to: (1) \ndisassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; (2) changing or \navoiding the environment where drugs were used; and (3) providing a \nsigned statement of intent to abstain from all drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, acknowledging that any future involvement or misuse is \ngrounds for revocation of national security eligibility. \n \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 26(a) and 26(b) minimally apply. Applicant\u2019s professed \u201cminor level of \nparticipation\u201d as well as \u201climited and infrequent\u201d marijuana use, nevertheless, constitute \ndrug involvement. Vacations and social events are not a valid excuse to use illegal drugs, \nand there is no evidence to indicate that it happened under such circumstances that it will \nbe unlikely to recur. It is highly significant that the use of marijuana occurred and \ncontinued occurring after Applicant was granted a security clearance in 2008. While \nApplicant now finally acknowledges his drug involvement and substance misuse, he has \nonly stated that he has been drug free since May 2016, and that he has ended his \nrelationships with his drug-using friends and relatives. There is no documentation, \nincluding character statements that might support his positions. He has submitted a \nformal statement of intent acknowledging that any future drug involvement or misuse is \ngrounds for revocation of national security eligibility. \n \nA person should not be held forever accountable for misconduct from the past, but \nin this instance, Applicant started using marijuana in December 2010, and his most recent \ndrug involvement and substance misuse was in May 2016, while Applicant was in \npossession of a security clearance. With a cavalier attitude towards laws, rules, and \nregulations spanning over five years, Applicant periodically used marijuana while holding \na security clearance. Despite knowing that such use was prohibited by both the \nGovernment and his employer, he claimed ignorance of the significance of doing so while \nholding a security clearance.  \n \nI have considered the entire record, including Applicant\u2019s admission of the SOR \nallegations. Applicant did finally come forward and admit his drug involvement, and for \ndoing so, I have given him some credit. However, Applicant\u2019s purported abstinence from \nmarijuana has only been for little over three years, or two years before the SOR was \nissued, while his use of marijuana occurred over a period of nearly six years. Applicant\u2019s \nabstinence should be encouraged, but his repeated marijuana use continued until at least \nMay 2016. Despite his claimed new maturity and intentions, Applicant\u2019s actions under the \ncircumstances continue to cast doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, and good \njudgment. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6 2(d): \n\n \n7 \n                                      \n \n  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nUnder SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. Moreover, I have \nevaluated the various aspects of this case in light of the totality of the record evidence \nand have not merely performed a piecemeal analysis. (See U.S. v. Bottone, 365 F.2d \n389, 392 (2d Cir. 1966); See also ISCR Case No. 03-22861 at 2-3 (App. Bd. Jun. 2, 2006))  \n  \nThere is some evidence mitigating Applicant\u2019s conduct. Applicant is a 35-year-old \nemployee of a defense contractor. He has been serving as a project manager with his \ncurrent employer since March 2011. A 2002 high school graduate, Applicant received a \nbachelor\u2019s degree in 2013. He served honorably in the U.S. Navy from July 2002 until he \nwas medically discharged with no reserve obligation. He was granted a security clearance \nin 2008, and that clearance has remained active. He has reportedly abstained from any \ndrug involvement and substance misuse since May 2016. Applicant finally voluntarily \ndisclosed his history of drug involvement and substance misuse when he completed his \ne-QIP in 2017.  \n \nThe disqualifying evidence under the whole-person concept is more substantial. \nApplicant admittedly was a marijuana user between December 2010 and May 2016, \ndescribing the frequency of such use as \u201cminor level of participation\u201d as well as \u201climited \nand infrequent\u201d use. Nevertheless, regardless of the frequency of such drug use, the use \nof marijuana was prohibited by both the Government and his employer, a defense \ncontractor, and it was illegal. The use of, or involvement with, marijuana raises questions \nabout an individual's judgment, reliability, trustworthiness, and willingness to comply with \nlaw, rules, and regulations, including federal laws. In this instance, Applicant\u2019s attitude \ntowards laws, rules, and regulations, is unacceptable, and his use of marijuana while \nholding a security clearance, even though he claimed ignorance of the significance of \ndoing so while holding a security clearance, continues to cast doubt on his current \nreliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. \n \nOverall, the evidence leaves me with substantial questions and doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all of these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant has failed to mitigate the security concerns arising from his drug \ninvolvement and substance abuse; and personal conduct. See SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6\u00b6 2(d)(1) \nthrough AG 2(d)(9). \n \n \n\n \n8 \n                                      \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline H:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a. and 1.b.: \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \n In light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant is a 37-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has worked for his current employer since May 2018. He is applying for a security clearance for the first time. He has associate\u2019s, bachelor\u2019s, and master\u2019s degrees, which were awarded in 2003, 2006, and 2010. He is married without children. (Transcript (Tr.) at 17, 23-24; GE 1, 2) The SOR alleges four defaulted student loans with balances totaling $37,522. Applicant admitted owing the loans, but he stated that he is paying them. Applicant funded his education with student loans. He is current on a number of loans that were not alleged in the SOR.

Applicant responded to the SOR and requested a hearing before an \nadministrative judge. The case was assigned to me on September 10, 2019.  \nThe hearing was convened as scheduled on October 30, 2019. Government \nExhibits (GE) 1 through 4 were admitted in evidence without objection. Applicant \ntestified and submitted Applicant\u2019s Exhibits (AE) A and B, which were admitted without \nobjection.  \n\n \n2 \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant is a 37-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has worked for \nhis current employer since May 2018. He is applying for a security clearance for the first \ntime. He has associate\u2019s, bachelor\u2019s, and master\u2019s degrees, which were awarded in \n2003, 2006, and 2010. He is married without children. (Transcript (Tr.) at 17, 23-24; GE \n1, 2) \n \n \nThe SOR alleges four defaulted student loans with balances totaling $37,522. \nApplicant admitted owing the loans, but he stated that he is paying them.  \n \n \nApplicant funded his education with student loans. He is current on a number of \nloans that were not alleged in the SOR. The four SOR loans were taken out between \n2003 and 2005 from the same bank. Applicant provided his payment history for the four \nloans. He made payments from 2007 through 2009, but then no additional payments \nuntil 2013. (Tr. at 20-21; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 2-4; AE A) \n \n \nApplicant made five payments to the loans in 2013; seven payments in 2014; five \npayments in 2015; and four payments in 2016. With the exception of a few months in \nwhich there were no payments, he has consistently made monthly payments to the \nbank since October 2017. The bank distributes the funds between the four loans. He \nincreased the amount of his payments to $200 per month in July 2018 and $250 per \nmonth in June 2019. His payments from October 2017 through August 2019 total \n$2,860. He credibly testified that he intends to continue paying all his student loans. (Tr. \nat 17-24; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 2-4; AE A) \n \n \nApplicant submitted letters attesting to his excellent job performance. He is \npraised for his work ethic, trustworthiness, dedication, professionalism, dependability, \nand integrity. (AE B) \n \nPolicies \n \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG), which became \neffective on June 8, 2017. \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \n\n \n3 \n \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.  \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18:       \n \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds.  \n\n \n4 \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case:   \n \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \n \nApplicant defaulted on four student loans. The evidence is sufficient to raise the \nabove disqualifying conditions. \n \n  \nConditions that could mitigate the financial considerations security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 20. The following is potentially applicable:  \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.  \n \n \nExcept for a few missed months, Applicant has been consistently paying his \nstudent loans for about two years. He increased the amount of his payments to $200 \nper month in July 2018 and $250 per month in June 2019. His payments from October \n2017 through August 2019 total $2,860. He credibly testified that he intends to continue \npaying all his student loans. AG \u00b6 20(d) is applicable. Concerns about Applicant\u2019s \nfinances are mitigated. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. I also considered Applicant\u2019s \nfavorable character evidence.  \n \n\n \n5 \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude Applicant \nmitigated the financial considerations security concerns.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.d: \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIt is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \n \n \n \n________________________ \nEdward W. Loughran \nAdministrative Judge \n \n \n \n",

Eligibility for \naccess to classified information is denied.  \n \n \n \n \n Statement of the Case \nApplicant submitted a security clearance application (SCA) on January 17, 2016. \nOn June 26, 2019, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications Facility \n(DOD CAF) issued to Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security \nconcerns under Guideline H and Guideline E. The action was taken under Executive \nOrder (EO) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, \n1960), as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security \nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the \nadjudicative guidelines (AG) effective on June 8, 2017.   \n \nApplicant answered the SOR on July 19, 2019, and requested a hearing before \nan administrative judge (Answer). The case was assigned to me on August 8, 2019. \n\n \n2 \n \n \nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a notice of hearing on \nAugust 29, 2019, setting the hearing for September 17, 2019. The hearing was held as \nscheduled.  \n \nDuring the hearing, Department Counsel offered Government Exhibits (GE) 1 \nand 2; Applicant testified, but did not offer any documents. I admitted all proffered \nexhibits into evidence without objection. DOHA received the hearing transcript (Tr.) on \nSeptember 30, 2019, and the record closed.   \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant admitted all of the allegations in his Answer to the SOR. After a \nthorough and careful review of the pleadings and exhibits submitted, I make the \nfollowing findings of fact. \n \n \nApplicant is 24 years old. He has never married and has no children. He earned \na bachelor\u2019s degree in May 2018. He has been employed by his present employer, a \nfederal contractor, since June 2018. His job title is software developer. Applicant was \ngranted an interim DOD security clearance on October 24, 2018, however, his security \nclearance was discontinued after the SOR was issued in June 2019. (Tr. 7, 13-14; GE \n1) \n \nIn his October 2018 SCA, Applicant disclosed that he had previously used \nmarijuana on three occasions during college. Between November 2016 and April 2017, \nhe consumed THC-infused cakes twice, and smoked marijuana once. He listed that his \nexperiences (of using THC) were rather \u201cunderwhelming, especially when considering \nthe risks of using it.\u201d Applicant admitted that his use of marijuana usually coincided with \ndrinking alcohol. He also acknowledged that marijuana use is illegal under Federal law \nand illegal in the state in which he resides. (Tr. 14-16, 22; GE 1) \n \n From December 2018 through January 2019, Applicant traveled to Europe with \nhis girlfriend. Before he departed for his trip, he had received an e-mail notifying him \nthat he had been granted an interim DOD security clearance. Applicant admitted \nreceiving this notice, but stated he was uncertain of the underlying implications and \nresponsibilities of being granted an interim security clearance. He did not seek before \nhis trip. In January 2019, Applicant and his girlfriend visited the city of Amsterdam \nwhere the use of marijuana is legal. They visited a coffee shop and purchased two \nmarijuana joints and two THC infused pastries, known as \u201cspace cakes.\u201d They \nconsumed all of their purchases during the course of one evening. Applicant admitted \nthis was the first time he felt the effects of the THC, and he considered it disorienting. \n(Tr. 17-22) \n \nSince his visit to Amsterdam in January 2019, Applicant has not used marijuana, \nand he stated at the hearing that he is willing to sign a letter of intent not to use \nmarijuana in the future. Applicant\u2019s supervisor is fully aware of Applicant\u2019s past use of \nmarijuana. His girlfriend has not used marijuana since their trip to Amsterdam. He \n\n \n3 \n \n \nknows of friends that occasionally use marijuana, but he does not socialize with them \nwhen they are using it. Applicant admitted that he experiences periods of anxiety, but he \nhas never used marijuana to treat his anxiety. He denied having any problems with \nmarijuana, and he does not need any type of substance abuse treatment. Applicant \nstated that he has been completely honest and forthright by disclosing his use of \nmarijuana during the course of his DOD investigation. (Tr. 22-25)  \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the AG. In addition to brief introductory explanations \nfor each guideline, the AG list potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating \nconditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified \ninformation. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 an \u201capplicant is responsible \nfor presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate \nfacts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the ultimate \nburden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\u201d  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk that an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n\n \n4 \n \n \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline H: Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \n \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse is set out in AG \u00b6 24:  \n \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior \nmay lead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations.  \n \n \nAG \u00b6 25 provides conditions that could raise security concerns. The following are \npotentially applicable:  \n \n(a) any substance misuse; and \n \n(f) any illegal drug use while granted access to classified information or \nholding a sensitive position. \n \n \nApplicant used marijuana at college a few times between November 2016 and \nApril 2017. He also used marijuana while visiting Amsterdam in January 2019, while he \nheld an interim DOD security clearance. The above disqualifying conditions apply.  \n \n \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns \nraised under Drug Involvement and Substance Abuse. The following mitigating \nconditions under AG \u00b6 26 are potentially applicable: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \nand \n \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, provides evidence of actions to overcome the problem, \nand has established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not limited to: \n\n \n5 \n \n \n \n \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; \n \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were being \nused; and  \n \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that any future \ninvolvement or misuse is grounds for revocation of national security \neligibility. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s last use of marijuana was less than a year ago. He was aware that \nmarijuana use was incompatible with the holding of a DOD security clearance. He filled \nout his October 2018 SCA and was granted an interim security clearance that same \nmonth. Applicant used marijuana less than three months later. He failed to abstain \ndespite acknowledging the potential work and personal costs that further marijuana use \ncould have on his life. Although Applicant provided some mitigation indicating he is now \nabstaining from marijuana use, has changed his environment, and has disassociated \nfrom those who use marijuana, those actions are insufficient to overcome his past \nconduct and his recent failure to abstain from marijuana use after being granted a DOD \nsecurity clearance. The record evidence leaves me with serious questions and doubts \nas to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, \nI conclude Applicant failed to mitigate the security concerns arising under Guideline H, \ndrug involvement and substance misuse. AG \u00b6 26(a) and (b) do not apply.  \n \nGuideline E: Personal Conduct \n \n \nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the security concern for personal conduct: \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. . . .  \n \n \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. The following disqualifying conditions are potentially applicable: \n \n(c) credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is \nnot sufficient for an adverse determination under any other single \nguideline, but which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-\nperson \nassessment \nof \nquestionable \njudgment, \nuntrustworthiness, \nunreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and \nregulations, or other characteristics indicating that the individual may not \nproperly safeguard classified or sensitive information;  \n\n \n6 \n \n \n \n(d) credible adverse information that is not explicitly covered under any \nother guideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an adverse \ndetermination, but which, when combined with all available information, \nsupports a whole-person assessment of questionable judgment, \nuntrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply \nwith rules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that the \nindividual may not properly safeguard classified or sensitive information. \nThis includes, but is not limited to, consideration of: . . . \n \n \n \n(3) a pattern of dishonesty or rule violations; and \n \n(e) personal conduct \u2026that creates a vulnerability to exploitation, \nmanipulation, or duress by a foreign intelligence entity or other individual \nor group. Such conduct includes: \n \n(1) engaging in activities which, if known, could affect the person\u2019s \npersonal, professional, or community standing, and \n \n(3) while in another country, engaging in any activity that, while \nlegal there, is illegal in the United States. \n \n \nGuideline H allegations \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b are cross-alleged under Guideline E \u00b6 2.a. \nEach of them is established by the record evidence. AG \u00b6\u00b6 16(c), 16(d)(3), and 16(e)(1) \nand (2) apply.   \n \n \nAG \u00b6 17 sets forth potentially applicable mitigating conditions under Guideline E: \n \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; and \n \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, \nunreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely \nto recur. \n \n \nApplicant used marijuana less than a year ago, and after he had been granted an \ninterim DOD security clearance. He acknowledged his misconduct and is remorseful. I \nfind that Applicant is intelligent, candid, and unlikely to use marijuana in the future, but \nhis behavior is too recent to overcome the personal conduct security concerns. His \ndecision to use marijuana after being granted an interim security clearance raises \nserious concerns about his judgment. AG \u00b6\u00b6 17(c) and 17(d) do not apply.  \n \n\n \n7 \n \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.  \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments \nunder Guidelines H and E in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 \n2(d) were addressed under that guideline, but some warrant additional comment. \n \nApplicant\u2019s last use of marijuana in 2019 is recent. The Directive does not define \n\u201crecent,\u201d and there is no \u201cbright-line\u201d definition of what constitutes \u201crecent\u201d conduct. \nISCR Case No. 03-02374 at 4 (App. Bd. Jan. 26, 2006). The Judge is required to \nevaluate the record evidence as a whole and reach a reasonable conclusion as to the \nrecency of an applicant's conduct. ISCR Case No. 03- 02374 at 4 (App. Bd. Jan. 26, \n2006). \n \nApplicant\u2019s use of marijuana while holding a security clearance places a heavy \nburden on him to establish mitigation. After considering the record as a whole, to \ninclude the circumstances surrounding Applicant\u2019s limited use of marijuana, and \nApplicant\u2019s remorse for his actions, I conclude that Applicant has not met his heavy \nburden of proof and persuasion due to the recency of his last use of marijuana and that \nhe used marijuana while holding a DOD security clearance. The evidence persuades \nme that he has not yet matured sufficiently to comport his behavior with applicable laws \nand regulations in general. More time is needed to demonstrate that he is fully capable \nof independently monitoring his behavior and to show that he is fully dependable. \nOverall, his recent conduct does cast doubt on his reliability, trustworthiness, and good \njudgment. For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant failed to mitigate the security \nconcerns arising under Guideline H and Guideline E.  \n \n \n\n \n8 \n \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline H:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.b: \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national security to grant Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security \nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n \n \n                                            \n \n \n \nPamela C. Benson \nAdministrative Judge \n",

Eligibility for access to classified \ninformation is denied.  \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nOn July 17, 2019, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications Facility \n(DOD CAF) issued Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security concerns \nunder Guideline F, financial considerations, and Guideline E, personal conduct. The \naction was taken under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information \nwithin Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense \nIndustrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended \n(Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) effective within the DOD on June 8, 2017. \n \n \nApplicant answered the SOR on August 8, 2019, and elected to have his case \ndecided on the written record in lieu of a hearing. Department Counsel submitted the \nGovernment\u2019s file of relevant material (FORM), and Applicant received it on September \n\n \n2 \n \n \n9, 2019. He was afforded an opportunity to file objections and submit material in \nrefutation, extenuation, or mitigation within 30 days of receipt of the FORM. The \nGovernment\u2019s evidence is identified as Items 1 through 8. Applicant submitted a timely \nresponse to the FORM and documents for consideration, which are marked as Applicant\u2019s \nExhibits (AE) A through I. Applicant disputed parts of Item 5 and his corrections are noted \nin the findings of facts. There were no other objections by Applicant or the Government \nto any of the other Items or exhibits and they are admitted into evidence. The case was \nassigned to me on October 30, 2019.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant admitted all of the SOR allegations. After a thorough and careful review \nof the pleadings and exhibits submitted, I make the following findings of fact. \n \nApplicant is 50 years old. He earned an associate\u2019s degree in 2009. He married in \n1990 and divorced in 2014. He has three grown children, ages 20, 24, and 26 years old. \nHe has worked for his current employer, a federal contractor, since July 2018. Before \nthen he worked for a different federal employer from November 2015 to July 2018. He \ndisclosed periods of employment and unemployment as follows: unemployed from July \n2015 to November 2015; employed by a federal contractor March 2009 to July 2015; \nunemployed November 2008 to March 2009; and employed by a federal contractor June \n2008 to October 2008. He disclosed he has held a security clearance since approximately \n2008.  \n \nApplicant completed a security clearance application (SCA) on August 5, 2018. \nSection 26 of the SCA asked if any of the following had occurred in the past seven years: \nany possessions or property voluntarily or involuntarily repossessed or foreclosed; \ndefaulted on any type of loan; had bills or debts turned over to a collection agency; had \nany account or credit card suspended, charged off, or cancelled for failing to pay as \nagreed. Applicant responded \u201cNo\u201d to all questions and did not disclose any delinquent \ndebts or loans.  \n \nThe SOR alleges 10 delinquent consumer debts, 1 medical debt, and 8 delinquent \nstudent loans totaling approximately $79,000. Three of the debts are for repossessed \nvehicles. Applicant was interviewed by a government investigator on November 19, 2018. \nThe investigator afforded Applicant an opportunity to provide information about his \nfinances and debts. (Item 5) \n \nApplicant disputed the investigator\u2019s characterization of Applicant\u2019s response in \nItem 5. Applicant stated in his FORM Response (Response) the following: \n \nWhen I was contacted by the investigator, I was not informed as to what the \ninterview was about. Only that it was a follow up for more information. When \nI arrived, the investigator asked if I had financial problems. I responded no \nbecause I took the question to be directed to present everyday life. I am \nable to pay my current bills and I am not struggling to pay for a place to live, \n\n \n3 \n \n \na car to drive, food on the table, and all associated monthly bills with living. \nIf they had asked if I had debt in collections, I would have said yes. Also, I \ndid not say I knew nothing of the list of debts that was presented to me. I \nresponded that I did know most of them, but I did not know the details of \nthem and there were quite a few that I did not know about at all. As we \nstarted to go over them, I was unable to tell the investigator what some of \nthem were. I was asked to take the list home with me to review and explain \nand come back at a later date with the info. That is exactly what I did. I \nresearched each and every one of the items and found the info of what they \nwere. I do not think what was reported, correctly conveys what actually \ntranspired. The FORM makes it sound like I denied my debt, acted like I did \nnot know anything about any of the items on the list but then was able to \ncome back with the info as if I knew what it was to begin with. I had to find \nthe info of what they were and was not trying to be deceitful. Some were \nbought by collection agencies, and I did not know who the originator of the \ndebt was. \n \nI have had some debt for some time. I have been trying to get a clear \nunderstanding of this for a few years now and everyday life sometimes \nredirects my efforts such as my father passing away recently, the contract I \nwork on changing hands, and my layoff for 4 months in 2015. There has \nbeen much confusion on my part as to the debt. Not to mention that student \nloans and repayment of them is not a straight forward thing. With that said, \nI have never been in a position where the debt I owe caused me issues with \ntaking care of myself or my family or kept me from paying my monthly bills.  \n \n* * * \n \nI have been aware of the majority of my debt but during the course of this \ninvestigation, it was revealed to me debt I did not know about. As for the car \nrepossessions, one was out of my control due to my layoff in 2015. The \nother two were voluntarily turned back over to the car dealer due to them \nselling me lemons that they refused to take responsibility for. I was \nunfamiliar with how these types of situations work and did not realize it was \nbeing put down as repossessions.  \n \n* * * \n \nIn my August 2018 e-QIP questions, I did not answer correctly the questions \nabout my debt. This was an honest mistake and not done so deliberately to \nhide or purposefully deceive anyone. I do not know why that answer was \nselected as no but I know at the time I was taking it, I was down to the final \ndays and was rushing to get it done.  \n \nOn November 26, 2018, Applicant was interviewed again by the government \ninvestigator. At that time, he acknowledged the debts alleged in the SOR to the \n\n \n4 \n \n \ninvestigator. He explained that he fell behind in paying his student loans in 2014 when his \nwife at the time needed surgery and had medical costs associated with it. He indicated \nhe owed approximately $27,368 from student loans that originated from 2007 through \n2009. He stated he was working with a default resolution group and looking into other \nprograms to help consolidate his outstanding student loans and create a payment plan. \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d, 1.e, 1.g, 1.k, 1.p, 1.q, 1.r, 1.s are the student loan allegations that total $28, \n407. Applicant told the investigator that his failure to disclose any of the delinquent \naccounts on his SCA was due to oversight. (Item 5) \n \nIn his SOR answer (Answer), Appellant provided a computer screen shot from a \ndebt resolution website that provided him with an overview of his defaulted student loans. \nThe document showed he made a payment of $3,451 in February 2019. He made \npayments of $232 for the months of March, April, June and July 2019. It also showed that \nhe made an additional payment in March of $350 and in April 2018, he made a payment \nof $1810. There was no proof of a May payment. (Answer)  \n \nIn Applicant\u2019s response to the FORM (Response), he provided a copy of a student \nloan rehabilitation agreement dated February 2019 that verified an amount had been \ncalculated, based on his income, to pay $232 a month. The agreement requires him to \nmake nine qualifying payments before the loans will be transferred to a new federal loan \nservicer. Applicant provided a document to show he made another payment in August \n2019. The rehabilitation document indicated that once Applicant completed the terms of \nthe agreement, he is required to reach out to the new federal loan servicer to establish \nrepayment arrangements. Applicant\u2019s federal student loans became delinquent in June \n2014, and his effort to rehabilitate them did not occur until February 2019. It is unknown \nif his agreement requires he make consecutive payments. (Response; AE C) \n \nIn Applicant\u2019s Response, he indicated he was working with a debt resolution \ncompany. It is unknown when he contracted with the company for its services. He \nprovided a document from the company from August 2019, indicating it had, on \nApplicant\u2019s behalf, disputed two debts on the SOR, and the debts were removed from his \ncredit report. The debts removed are alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.h ($1,759) and 1.i ($1,197). \n(Response, AE D, E, F, G) \n \nApplicant attributes his financial problems to four months of unemployment in 2015 \nand his 2014 divorce. In his SCA, Applicant disclosed he was charged with a \nmisdemeanor in October 2015 and was required to pay a \u201chefty fine.\u201d Applicant had debts \ndischarged in Chapter 7 bankruptcy in 1998. In Applicant\u2019s interview with the government \ninvestigator, he explained that the medical debt (SOR \u00b6 1.o-$602) was incurred for \nservices for his current wife\u2019s surgery, and he was laid off shortly thereafter and unable \nto pay the medical bill. Credit reports show this medical bill was incurred in May 2012, \nprior to both Applicant\u2019s divorce and unemployment. The credit reports also show \nApplicant stopped making payments on two of his auto loans months prior to his July \n2015 lay off. (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b and 1.c) The debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.a ($13,388) became \ndelinquent in July 2018. (I have not considered Applicant\u2019s unalleged bankruptcy or \nmisdemeanor for disqualifying purposes, but may consider it when analyzing the whole-\n\n \n5 \n \n \nperson, in making a credibility determination, and in applying the mitigating conditions.) \n(Items 5, 6, 7, 8, 9) \n \nApplicant stated in his Response to the FORM that when his father passed away \nin March 2019, he inherited his father\u2019s Individual Retirement Account (IRA). He did not \nindicate the amount of money he would inherit after taxes. He said he planned to use \n\u201csome, if not all\u201d of the proceeds to satisfy his remaining debts. He had not received the \nproceeds. (AE A) \n \nApplicant provided a character letter from a person who has known him for ten \nyears and is his friend. The writer has never seen Applicant engage in any activity or \nspeak in any way that would be considered disloyal to his employer, the country, or pose \nany national security threat. He considers Applicant loyal and a person who has integrity. \nHe trusts Applicant. (AE I) \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for national security eligibility, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere \nspeculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 states an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\u201d  \n \n\n \n6 \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for financial considerations is set out \nin AG & 18:  \n \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \n \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an individual might knowingly \ncompromise classified information in order to raise money. It encompasses concerns \nabout an individual\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting \nclassified information. An individual who is financially irresponsible may also be \nirresponsible, unconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified \ninformation. See ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \n \nAG \u00b6 19 provides conditions that could raise security concerns. The following are \npotentially applicable:  \n \n \n(a) inability to satisfy debts;  \n\n \n7 \n \n \n \n \n \n(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \n  \n \nApplicant has numerous delinquent debts and student loans totaling more than \n$79,000 that remain unresolved. These debts and loan delinquencies began \naccumulating in approximately 2012 and 2014. There is sufficient evidence to support the \napplication of the above disqualifying conditions. \n \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising \nfrom financial difficulties. The following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially \napplicable: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control;  \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and  \n \n(e) the individual had a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of action \nto resolve the issue. \n \n \nApplicant admitted the numerous delinquent debts and student loans in the SOR. \nHe recently contracted with a debt resolution company and two debts have been removed \nfrom his credit report. He failed to provide evidence that he has paid or resolved any of \nhis other delinquent debts. His student loans became delinquent in 2014. Although he \nmade a payment in April 2018, he failed to begin to seriously address them until after he \nwas interviewed by a government investigator and his security clearance was in jeopardy. \nHe is participating in a student loan rehabilitation plan and has made several payments, \nbut he has not yet completed the program or provided an explanation for a missed \nmonthly payment and its potential impact on his agreement. Applicant\u2019s delinquent debts \nand student loans are numerous, recent and ongoing. His failure to pay his financial \n\n \n8 \n \n \nobligations cast doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. AG \n\u00b6 20(a) does not apply.  \n \n \nApplicant attributed his financial problems to his wife\u2019s surgery and then \nunemployment in 2015. He has been steadily employed since November 2015. He made \na payment toward his student loans in April 2018, but then he failed to provide evidence \nof any action he took to resume his student loan payments until February 2019, which \nwas after his reinvestigation for a security clearance began. Applicant admitted he owed \nthe debts alleged in the SOR. Other than two delinquent debts that were removed from \nhis credit report, he has not provided documentary evidence that he is paying any of the \ndebts. One of his debts became delinquent in July 2018, while he was employed. \nApplicant\u2019s unemployment was beyond is control, but he failed to act responsibly after he \nobtained employment. He has taken some action recently, but he has not yet completed \na student loan rehabilitation program. AG \u00b6 20(b) is only partially applicable.  \n \n \nThere is no evidence Applicant has participated in financial counseling, but he is \nworking with a debt resolution company. Other than making some payments toward his \nstudent loans through a rehabilitation program, he has not provided evidence that he is \npaying any of his other creditors. At this juncture, there are not clear indications his \nfinancial problems are under control. There is evidence that he has made payments \nthrough a rehabilitation program to take his student loans out of default status. The fact \nthat Applicant failed to seriously address his student loans until after his security \nclearance was in jeopardy diminishes a finding that his actions were a good-faith effort. \nThe remaining evidence is insufficient to show he has paid any other of his delinquent \ndebts. AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(c) does not apply. AG \u00b6 20(d) minimally applies towards his student \nloans. \n \n \nThrough his debt resolution company, Applicant disputed two debts that were \nremoved from his credit report. AG \u00b6 20(e) applies to these debts.  \n \nGuideline E: Personal Conduct \nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the security concern for personal conduct:  \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process.  \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. I find the following potentially applicable:  \n \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar \n\n \n9 \n \n \nform used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, \naward benefits or status, determine security clearance eligibility or \ntrustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities. \n \nI have considered Applicant\u2019s explanation that he made an honest mistake when \nhe failed to disclose any of his delinquent debts on his SCA. In his Response, he said he \nmistakenly answered \u201cno\u201d because he was rushed. Throughout his SCA, Applicant \nprovided explanations and information in response to various questions, showing he took \ntime to provide a detailed response. Section 26 is a long detailed question that includes \nmultiple inquiries on different types of debts, some of which Applicant experienced. In his \nResponse, he said that when the investigator asked if he had any financial problems, he \nanswered \u201cno\u201d because he was able to pay his current bills. Applicant went on to explain \n\u201cIf they had asked if I had debt in collection, I would have said \u201cyes.\u201d Applicant was aware \nhe had numerous delinquent debts, but it appears he was reluctant to disclose them. His \nexcuse that the investigator did not phrase the question in a manner that would illicit a \nspecific response from him is not persuasive. The government relies on people to be \nforthcoming and honest on their SF 86 and when being interviewed by a government \ninvestigator. I do not find Applicant\u2019s explanation that he made an honest mistake when \nhe failed to disclose his numerous financial problems on his SCA. I find he deliberately \nfailed to do so. AG \u00b6 16(a) applies. \n \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising \nfrom personal conduct. I have considered the following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 \n17: \n \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; and \n \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment.  \n \nThe evidence does not support the application of AG \u00b6 17(a). There is insufficient \nevidence to conclude that Applicant made a prompt, good-faith effort to correct his \nomissions. He continued to be reluctant to provide the information when he was \nquestioned by the investigator. \n \nThe evidence does not establish mitigation under AG \u00b6 17(a). Applicant did not \nmake a prompt good-faith effort to correct his financial omissions before he was \nconfronted. He was aware he had numerous delinquent debts and deliberately failed to \ndisclose them. The government relies on people to be forthcoming and honest on their \nSF 86, especially when the information requested is derogatory. AG \u00b6 17(c) does not \napply because deliberately failing to disclose information on a SF 86 and swearing to its \naccuracy is not a minor offense. I find Applicant\u2019s omissions are serious and cast doubt \non his reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. \n\n \n10 \n \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.  \n       \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuidelines E and F in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were \naddressed under those guidelines, but some warrant additional comment. \n \nApplicant is 50 years old. He experienced financial problems when he divorced in \n2014 and was unemployed for four months in 2015. He has been fully employed since \nNovember 2015, but failed to take consistent action on any of his delinquent student loans \nor debts until after his background investigation began. He recently began a student loan \nrehabilitation program, but has not completed it. He indicated he has inherited money \nfrom his father\u2019s IRA that he hopes to use to pay some or all of his debts. He has not \nreceived the money yet. He did not provide information as to the amount he will receive \nand a promise to pay does not amount to resolving his debts. Although he is working with \na debt resolution company, he has not provided proof he has paid any of his debts. \nApplicant does not have a reliable financial track record. He has not met his burden of \npersuasion. The record evidence leaves me with serious questions and doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant failed to mitigate the security concerns arising under Guideline F, \nfinancial considerations, and Guideline E, personal conduct. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n11 \n \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1g.: \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.h-1.i: \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.j-1.s: \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \n \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \n  \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national security to continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security \nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nCarol G.

He \nhas relatives, including his spouse and parents, who are citizens and residents of Syria. \nHis relationships with them create a heightened risk of foreign exploitation, inducement, \nmanipulation, pressure, or coercion. Foreign influence security concerns are not mitigated. \nEligibility for access to classified information is denied.        \nStatement of the Case \nOn June 16, 2017, Applicant completed and signed a Questionnaire for National \nSecurity Positions or security clearance application (SCA). (Government Exhibit (GE) 1) \nOn June 10, 2019, the Department of Defense (DOD) Consolidated Adjudications Facility \n(CAF) issued a statement of reasons (SOR) to Applicant under Executive Order (Exec. \nOr.) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry, February 20, 1960; DOD \nDirective 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program \n(Directive), January 2, 1992; and Security Executive Agent Directive 4, establishing in \nAppendix A the National Security Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for \nAccess to Classified Information or Eligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position (AGs), effective \nJune 8, 2017. (Hearing Exhibit (HE) 2)  \nThe SOR detailed reasons why the DOD CAF did not find under the Directive that \nit is clearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant or continue a security \nclearance for Applicant and recommended referral to an administrative judge to determine \n\n \n2                                        \n \n \nwhether a clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked. Specifically, the \nSOR set forth security concerns arising under Guideline B (foreign influence). (HE 2) On \nJuly 1, 2019, Applicant responded to the SOR and requested a hearing. (HE 3)  \n \nOn September 10, 2019, Department Counsel was ready to proceed. On October \n15, 2019, the case was assigned to me. On October 16, 2019, the Defense Office of \nHearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a notice, setting Applicant\u2019s hearing for November \n14, 2019. (HE 1) The hearing was held as scheduled. \n \nDuring the hearing, Department Counsel offered four exhibits (GE 1-4); Applicant \noffered one exhibit (Applicant Exhibit (AE) A); there were no objections to GEs 1-3 and AE \nA; and all proffered exhibits, except GE 4, were admitted into evidence. (Transcript (Tr.) \n14-16) On November 26, 2019, DOHA received a transcript of the hearing.  \n \nProcedural Rulings \n \nDepartment Counsel offered summaries for administrative notice concerning \nforeign influence security concerns raised by Applicant\u2019s connections to Syria and Saudi \nArabia. (Tr. 16-17; GE 3, 4) Applicant objected to administrative notice concerning Saudi \nArabia because of his and his relative\u2019s lack of connections to Saudi Arabia, and I deferred \nruling on the request for administrative notice. (Tr. 17; GE 4) Applicant did not object to \nme taking administrative notice of those facts concerning Syria, and I granted Department \nCounsel\u2019s motion. (Tr. 17; GE 3) Administrative or official notice is the appropriate type of \nnotice used for administrative proceedings. See ISCR Case No. 16-02522 at 2-3 (App. Bd. \nJuly 12, 2017); ISCR Case No. 05-11292 at 4 n. 1 (App. Bd. Apr. 12, 2007); ISCR Case \nNo. 02-24875 at 2 (App. Bd. Oct. 12, 2006) (citing ISCR Case No. 02-18668 at 3 (App. \nBd. Feb. 10, 2004) and McLeod v. Immigration and Naturalization Service, 802 F.2d 89, \n93 n. 4 (3d Cir. 1986)). Usually administrative notice at ISCR proceedings is accorded to \nfacts that are either well known or from government reports. See Stein, ADMINISTRATIVE \nLAW, Section 25.01 (Bender & Co. 2006) (listing fifteen types of facts for administrative \nnotice). Portions of the Department Counsel\u2019s request for administrative notice are quoted \nwithout quotation marks and footnotes.  \n \nDepartment Counsel proffered an administrative notice request concerning Saudi \nArabia; however, the evidence of record is that Applicant\u2019s relatives who were living in \nSaudi Arabia left Saudi Arabia after the SOR was issued. (GE 4) Government Exhibit four \nis not admitted because of its lack of relevance; however, it is attached to the record for \npotential appellate consideration. \n \nDepartment Counsel moved to withdraw the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c (alleges \nApplicant\u2019s sister is a dual citizen of the United States and Syria, and she resides in Saudi \nArabia) and 1.g (alleges Applicant\u2019s sister-in-law is a citizen of Syria and a resident of \nSaudi Arabia). (Tr. 48) Applicant did not object, and Department Counsel\u2019s motion was \ngranted. (Tr. 48-49) \n \nSome details in this case were excluded to protect Applicant\u2019s right to privacy. \nSpecific information is available in the cited exhibits and transcript.  \n\n \n3                                        \n \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn Applicant\u2019s SOR response, he admitted the SOR allegations in \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through \n1.f. (HE 3) He denied SOR \u00b6 1.g. He also provided extenuating and mitigating information. \n(HE 3) His admissions are accepted as findings of fact.   \n \nApplicant is a 34-year-old information technology security officer. (Tr. 18, 28) \nApplicant\u2019s parents were living in the United States when Applicant was born in the United \nStates. (Tr. 29) When Applicant was six years old, he moved from the United States to \nSyria with his parents. (Tr. 29) In 2001, he returned to the United States when he was 16 \nor 17 years old without his parents, and he lived with his brother. (Tr. 30) Around 2002 or \n2003, he graduated from high school in the United States. (Tr. 30) After high school \nApplicant attended a university for one or two semesters in the United States, and then he \nattended a university in Cyprus from 2004 to 2008. (Tr. 31) During breaks, Applicant \ntraveled from Cyprus to Syria, and he did not go to the United States. (Tr. 31)  \n \nFrom 2008 to 2012, Applicant lived in Syria and worked in his father\u2019s store. (Tr. \n32) In late 2012, Applicant returned to the United States. (Tr. 33) In about 2013 or 2014 \nfor about 13 months, Applicant was deployed to Afghanistan. (Tr. 33) Applicant does not \nown any real estate in the United States or Syria. (Tr. 34) Applicant does not currently \nhave a security clearance; however, if he receives a security clearance it will enhance his \nvalue to his company and his ability to provide greater contributions to mission \naccomplishment. (Tr. 45-46) Applicant does not intend to be employed as a linguist or \ntranslator. \n \nForeign Influence  \n \nApplicant\u2019s mother and father are dual citizens of the United States and Syria. (SOR \nresponse to \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b) In 1991, Applicant\u2019s parents moved from the United States to \nSyria, and they have lived in Syria ever since, except for about a year they lived in the \nUnited States several years ago. (Tr. 34, 40) His parents rely on his father\u2019s inheritance \nand funds saved from his father\u2019s employment when he owned a business in Syria for their \nlivelihoods. (Tr. 35) Applicant traveled to Syria twice in 2018 and twice in 2019 to visit his \nrelatives. (Tr. 40) He communicates with his parents on a weekly basis. (Tr. 40) \n \nApplicant paid the Syrian government $6,000 to avoid Syrian military service. (Tr. \n40) He was eligible for this benefit because he had dual citizenship with the United States \nand had lived outside of Syria for more than five years. (Tr. 41) One or both of his brothers \nalso avoided Syrian military service by paying $6,000. (Tr. 42)  \n \nApplicant has two brothers and one sister. (Tr. 35) One brother lives in the United \nStates, and another brother lived in Saudi Arabia and moved to the United States. (Tr. 15, \n36) His sister recently moved from Saudi Arabia to the United Arab Emirates (UAE). (Tr. \n36) Her husband works for an American company. (Tr. 36) None of Applicant\u2019s three \nsiblings have worked for the Syrian government or military. (Tr. 36-37) \n \n\n \n4                                        \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s spouse and parents-in-law are citizens and residents of Syria. (SOR \nresponse to \u00b6\u00b6 1.d, 1.e, and 1.f) In January 2018, Applicant married his spouse in Syria. \n(Tr. 37) His spouse is 25 years old. (Tr. 42) His spouse lives with her parents. His spouse \nand parents-in-law are not employed by the Syrian government or military. (Tr. 38-39) \nApplicant has been waiting two years for approval of his spouse\u2019s visa to enable her to \ntravel to the United States. (Tr. 27-28) The Administrative Notice concerning Syria \nindicates Syrian nationals are having difficulty getting visas to the United States. Applicant \ndoes not have any children.

(Tr. 42) \n \nApplicant\u2019s spouse has three siblings. (Tr. 39) One sister lives in Dubai; another \nsister lives in Germany; and her brother lives in Canada. (Tr. 39)  \n \nApplicant objected to the government of Syria because of the way that government \ntreated people. (Tr. 27) He said, \u201cI feel like that they\u2019re a dictatorship, and they\u2019re a bunch \nof thugs.\u201d (Tr. 27) \n \nApplicant worked for a government contractor in Afghanistan for 13 months as a \nprogram manager. (Tr. 21, 24-25) On one occasion, someone attacked one of his \nemployer\u2019s offices and blew it up. (Tr. 25) He risked injury or death on a daily basis when \ntraveling in Afghanistan due to shootings and roadside bombs. (Tr. 25-26) He continued \nhis employment in Afghanistan because he was loyal to his employer and the United \nStates. (Tr. 26) Applicant was not injured in Afghanistan. (Tr. 22) He believed in the \nmission of helping the Afghan government become a democratic country. (Tr. 26) \nApplicant loves the United States, and he supports the United States over all other \ncountries.

He reiterated the positive statements of Applicant\u2019s \nsupervisor. (Tr. 46-47) He emphasized that Applicant is a global citizen who risked his life \nto protect U.S. interests in Afghanistan.  \n \nSyria \n \nThe Syrian Arab Republic is ruled by an authoritarian regime dominated by the \nSocialist Ba\u2019ath Party which is currently engaged in a full-scale civil war with the armed \nSyrian opposition. Sources estimate that the conflict has resulted in over 400,000 deaths \n\n \n5                                        \n \n \nwith many thousands more wounded. The Syrian conflict has resulted in over 5.1 million \nregistered Syrian refugees, and approximately 6.3 million people are displaced inside \nSyria, while 4.53 million remain in hard-to-reach and besieged areas. Attacks from the \nregime or other groups could happen with little or no warning, no part of Syria should be \nconsidered immune from violence, and the potential exists throughout the country for \nunpredictable and hostile acts, including kidnappings, sniper assaults, terrorist attacks, \nsmall arms fire, improvised explosives, artillery shelling, airstrikes, the use of chemical \nweapons, large- and small-scale bombings, as well as arbitrary arrest, detention, and \ntorture. \n \nThe Department of State has issued a Level 4: Do Not Travel Advisory regarding \nSyria, stating: \u201cDo not travel to Syria due to terrorism, civil unrest, kidnapping, and armed \nconflict.\u201d The U.S. Embassy in Damascus suspended its operations in February 2012. \nThe Czech Republic serves as the protecting power for U.S. citizens in Syria. The range \nof consular services that the Czech Republic provides to U.S. citizens is extremely limited, \nand the U.S. government is unable to provide emergency services to U.S. citizens in \nSyria. There is an ongoing and increased risk of kidnapping of U.S. citizens and \nWesterners throughout the country. U.S. citizens remain a target, and many abductions \nhaving occurred since mid-2012. \n \nDespite successes, the terrorist landscape grew more complex in 2017. ISIS, al-\nQaida (AQ), and their affiliates have proven to be resilient, determined, and adaptable, \nand they have adjusted to heightened counterterrorism pressure in Syria and elsewhere. \nThe return or relocation of foreign terrorist fighters from the battlefield has contributed to \na growing cadre of experienced, sophisticated, and connected terrorist networks, which \ncan plan and execute terrorist attacks. ISIS, AQ, and its affiliates continued to maintain \nsafe havens amidst the fragile political and security climate across the region, particularly \nin Yemen and Syria.  \n \nPresident Bashar Assad has ruled the Syrian Arab Republic since 2000. The \nconstitution mandates the primacy of Ba\u2019ath Party leaders in state institutions and society, \nand Assad and Ba\u2019ath party leaders dominate all three branches of government as an \nauthoritarian regime. An uprising against the government that began in 2011 continued \nthroughout the year. The 2014 presidential election and the April 2016 parliamentary \nelections resulted in the election of Assad and 200 People\u2019s Council (Syrian parliament) \nseats for the Ba\u2019ath Party-led National Progressive Front, respectively. Both elections \ntook place in an environment of widespread government coercion, and many Syrians \nresiding in opposition-held territory did not participate in the elections. Observers did not \nconsider the elections free or fair. \n \nDesignated in 1979 as a State Sponsor of Terrorism, Syria continued its political \nand military support to a variety of terrorist groups. The regime continued to provide \nweapons and political support to Lebanese Hezbollah (LH) and continued to allow Iran to \nrearm the terrorist organization. The Assad regime\u2019s relationship with LH and Iran grew \nstronger in 2017 as the regime became more reliant on external actors to fight regime \nopponents. President Bashar al-Assad remained a staunch defender of lran\u2019s policies, \nwhile Iran exhibited equally energetic support for the Syrian regime.  \n\n \n6                                        \n \n \nOver the past decade, the Assad regime\u2019s permissive attitude towards AQ and \nother terrorist groups\u2019 foreign terrorist fighter facilitation efforts during the Syria conflict in \nturn fed the growth of AQ, ISIS, and affiliated terrorist networks inside Syria. The Syrian \ngovernment\u2019s awareness and encouragement for many years of terrorists\u2019 transit through \nSyria to enter Syria for the purpose of fighting Coalition Forces is well documented. Those \nnetworks were among the terrorist elements that brutalized the Syrian population in 2017. \nAdditionally, Shia militia groups, some of which are U.S. designated Foreign Terrorist \nOrganizations aligned with Iran, continued to travel to Syria to fight on behalf of the Assad \nregime.  \n \nDuring 2018, government-linked paramilitary groups reportedly engaged in \nfrequent violations and abuses, including massacres, indiscriminate killings, kidnapping \nof civilians, arbitrary detentions, and rape as a war tactic. Government-affiliated militias, \nincluding LH, supported by Iran, repeatedly targeted civilians. The Syrian government \ntook no steps to investigate, prosecute, or punish officials who committed human rights \nviolations or abuses. Impunity was pervasive and deeply embedded in the security forces \nand elsewhere in the government.  \n \nIn December 2015, President Obama signed into law the Visa Waiver Program \nImprovement and Terrorist Travel Protection Act of 2015, which amended the existing \nVisa Waiver Program. Under the 2015 amendment, citizens of Iran, Syria, Sudan, and \nSyria are ineligible to travel or be admitted to the United States under the Visa Waiver \nProgram. The exclusion of these countries from waiver eligibility reflects the determination \nof the Secretary of Homeland Security that the presence of an individual in that country \nincreases the likelihood that the individual is a credible threat to the national security of \nthe United States; that a foreign terrorist organization has a significant presence in the \ncountry; or that the county is a safe haven for terrorists. \n \nOn September 24, 2017, President Trump suspended the \u201centry into the United \nStates of nationals of Syria as immigrants and nonimmigrants\u201d due to \u201csignificant \ninadequacies in [Syria\u2019s] identity-management protocols, [its failure] to share public-\nsafety and terrorism information,\u201d and the country\u2019s status as \u201cthe source of significant \nterrorist threats.\u201d Subject to limited exceptions for dual-nationals, current visa holders, \nother narrow categories, and the Department of Homeland Security\u2019s authority to waive \nthe ban \u201cin the national interest,\u201d Syrian nationals are categorically banned from entering \nthe United States. \n \n \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the Executive \nBranch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security emphasizing, \n\u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. \n518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to control \naccess to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual \nis sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The President \nhas authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicant\u2019s eligibility for \n\n \n7                                        \n \n \naccess to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865. \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable.  \n \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nabout potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Clearance \ndecisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a \ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 7. \nThus, nothing in this decision should be construed to suggest that it is based, in whole or \nin part, on any express or implied determination about applicant\u2019s allegiance, loyalty, or \npatriotism. It is merely an indication the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the \nPresident, Secretary of Defense, and DNI have established for issuing a clearance. \n \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 at 2 \n(App. Bd. May 2, 1996). \n \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it \nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d \nISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). The burden of disproving a \nmitigating condition never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 \n(App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if they must, \non the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b). \n \n \n \n\n \n8                                        \n \n \nAnalysis \n \n Foreign Influence \n \n  \nAG \u00b6 6 explains the security concern about \u201cforeign contacts and interests\u201d stating: \n \nForeign contacts and interests, including, but not limited to, business, \nfinancial, and property interests, are a national security concern if they result \nin divided allegiance. They may also be a national security concern if they \ncreate circumstances in which the individual may be manipulated or induced \nto help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a way \ninconsistent with U.S. interests or otherwise made vulnerable to pressure \nor coercion by any foreign interest. Assessment of foreign contacts and \ninterests should consider the country in which the foreign contact or interest \nis located, including, but not limited to, considerations such as whether it is \nknown to target U.S. citizens to obtain classified or sensitive information or \nis associated with a risk of terrorism. \n \nAG \u00b6 7 lists conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying \nin this case: \n \n(a) contact, regardless of method, with a foreign family member, business \nor professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or \nresident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of \nforeign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; and \n \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual\u2019s obligation to \nprotect classified or sensitive information or technology and the individual\u2019s \ndesire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing that \ninformation or technology. \n \nApplicant\u2019s mother and father are dual citizens of the United States and Syria. His \nparents currently live in Syria. Applicant\u2019s spouse and parents-in-law are citizens and \nresidents of Syria, and they are not citizens of the United States. Applicant\u2019s spouse lives \nwith her parents in Syria. Applicant has frequent contact with his parents and spouse.  \n \nWhen an allegation under a disqualifying condition is established, \u201cthe Directive \npresumes there is a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct or \ncircumstances . . . and an applicant\u2019s security eligibility. Direct or objective evidence of \nnexus is not required.\u201d ISCR Case No. 17-00507 at 2 (App. Bd. June 13, 2018) (citing \nISCR Case No. 15-08385 at 4 (App. Bd. May 23, 2018)). \n \nThere are widely documented safety issues for residents of Syria primarily \nbecause of terrorists and criminals and the ongoing civil war. The war in Syria has resulted \nin over 400,000 deaths and displacement of millions of Syrian residents. The Syrian \n\n \n9                                        \n \n \ngovernment is closely related to the Iranian government, and both of them are hostile to \nthe United States interests. Syria is a state sponsor of terrorism. \n     \nThe mere possession of close family ties with relatives living in a foreign country \nis not, as a matter of law, disqualifying under Guideline B. However, if an applicant, his \nor her spouse, or someone sharing living quarters with them, has such a relationship with \neven one person living in a foreign country, this factor alone is sufficient to create the \npotential for foreign influence and could potentially result in the compromise of classified \ninformation. See ISCR Case No. 08-02864 at 4-5 (App. Bd. Dec. 29, 2009) (discussing \nproblematic visits of applicant\u2019s father to Iran).  \n  \nThere is a rebuttable presumption that a person has ties of affection for, or \nobligation to, his or her immediate family members, and this presumption includes in-\nlaws. ISCR Case No. 07-06030 at 3 (App. Bd. June 19, 2008); ISCR Case No. 05-00939 \nat 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 3, 2007) (citing ISCR Case No. 01-03120 at 4 (App. Bd. Feb. 20, \n2002)).    \n \nThe DOHA Appeal Board has indicated for Guideline B cases, \u201cthe nature of the \nforeign government involved and the intelligence-gathering history of that government are \namong the important considerations that provide context for the other record evidence \nand must be brought to bear on the Judge\u2019s ultimate conclusions in the case. The \ncountry\u2019s human rights record is another important consideration.\u201d ISCR Case No. 16-\n02435 at 3 (May 15, 2018) (citing ISCR Case No. 15-00528 at 3 (App. Bd. Mar. 13, 2017)). \nAnother important consideration is the nature of a nation\u2019s government\u2019s relationship with \nthe United States. These factors are relevant in assessing the likelihood that an \napplicant\u2019s family members living in that country are vulnerable to government coercion \nor inducement.  \n \nThe risk of coercion, persuasion, or duress is significantly greater if the foreign \ncountry has an authoritarian government, the government ignores the rule of law including \nwidely accepted civil liberties, a family member is associated with or dependent upon the \ngovernment, the government is engaged in a counterinsurgency, terrorism causes a \nsubstantial amount of death or property damage, or the country is known to conduct \nintelligence collection operations against the United States. The relationship of Syria with \nthe United States and the situation in Syria place a significant burden of persuasion on \nApplicant to demonstrate that his relationships with any family member living in or visiting \nSyria do not pose a security risk. Applicant should not be placed into a position where he \nmight be forced to choose between loyalty to the United States and concerns about \nassisting a relative living in or visiting Syria.  \n \nThe Appeal Board in ISCR Case No. 03-24933, 2005 DOHA LEXIS 346 at *20-*21 \nn. 18 (App. Bd. 2005), explained how relatives in a foreign country have a security \nsignificance: \n \nThe issue under Guideline B is not whether an applicant\u2019s immediate family \nmembers in a foreign country are of interest to a foreign power based on \ntheir prominence or personal situation. Rather, the issue is whether an \n\n \n10                                        \n \n \napplicant\u2019s ties and contacts with immediate family members in a foreign \ncountry raise security concerns because those ties and contacts create a \npotential vulnerability that a foreign power could seek to exploit in an effort \nto get unauthorized access to U.S. classified information that an applicant  \n-- not the applicant\u2019s immediate family members -- has by virtue of a security \nclearance. A person may be vulnerable to influence or pressure exerted on, \nor through, the person\u2019s immediate family members -- regardless of whether \nthe person\u2019s family members are prominent or not. \n \nGuideline B security or trustworthiness concerns are not limited to countries hostile \nto the United States. \u201cThe United States has a compelling interest in protecting and \nsafeguarding classified information from any person, organization, or country that is not \nauthorized to have access to it, regardless of whether that person, organization, or \ncountry has interests inimical to those of the United States.\u201d ISCR Case No. 02-11570 at \n5 (App. Bd. May 19, 2004). Furthermore, friendly nations can have profound \ndisagreements with the United States over matters they view as important to their vital \ninterests or national security. Finally, we know friendly nations have engaged in \nespionage against the United States, especially in the economic, scientific, and technical \nfields. See ISCR Case No. 02-22461, 2005 DOHA LEXIS 1570 at *11-*12 (App. Bd. Oct. \n27, 2005) (citing ISCR Case No. 02-26976 at 5-6 (App. Bd. Oct. 22, 2004)) (discussing \nTaiwan). \nWhile there is no evidence that intelligence operatives, criminals, or terrorists from \nor in Syria seek or have sought classified or economic information from or through \nApplicant or his family, nevertheless, it is not prudent to rule out such a possibility in the \nfuture. International terrorist groups are known to conduct intelligence activities as \neffectively as capable state intelligence services, and Syria has a significant problem with \nterrorism and crime. Applicant\u2019s family in those countries \u201ccould be a means through \nwhich Applicant comes to the attention of those who seek U.S. information or technology \nand who would attempt to exert coercion upon him.\u201d ADP Case No. 14-01655 at 3 (App. \nBd. Dec. 9, 2015) (citing ISCR Case No. 14-02950 at 3 (App. Bd. May 14, 2015)).  \nApplicant\u2019s relationships with relatives who are living in Syria or visiting that country \ncreate a potential conflict of interest because terrorists could place pressure on his family \nin Syria in an effort to cause Applicant to compromise classified information. These \nrelationships create \u201ca heightened risk of foreign inducement, manipulation, pressure, or \ncoercion\u201d under AG \u00b6 7. Department Counsel produced substantial evidence of \nApplicant\u2019s relationships with family in Syria and has raised the issue of potential foreign \npressure or attempted exploitation. AG \u00b6\u00b6 7(a) and 7(b) apply, and further inquiry is \nnecessary about potential application of any mitigating conditions.  \n \nAG \u00b6 8 lists six conditions that could mitigate foreign influence security concerns \nincluding: \n \n(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in which \nthese persons are located, or the positions or activities of those persons in \nthat country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be placed in a \n\n \n11                                        \n \n \nposition of having to choose between the interests of a foreign individual, \ngroup, organization, or government and the interests of the United States; \n \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of \nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, or allegiance to the group, \ngovernment, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such deep and \nlongstanding relationships and loyalties in the United States, that the \nindividual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the \nU.S. interest; \n \n(c) contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and infrequent \nthat there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign influence or \nexploitation; \n \n(d) the foreign contacts and activities are on U.S. Government business or \nare approved by the agency head or designee; \n \n(e) the individual has promptly complied with existing agency requirements \nregarding the reporting of contacts, requests, or threats from persons, \ngroups, or organizations from a foreign country; and \n \n(f) the value or routine nature of the foreign business, financial, or property \ninterests is such that they are unlikely to result in a conflict and could not be \nused effectively to influence, manipulate, or pressure the individual. \n \nThe DOHA Appeal Board concisely explained Applicant\u2019s responsibility for proving \nthe applicability of mitigating conditions as follows:  \n \nOnce a concern arises regarding an Applicant\u2019s security clearance eligibility, \nthere is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance of a security \nclearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th Cir. 1990), \ncert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991). After the Government presents evidence \nraising security concerns, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut or \nmitigate those concerns. See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. The standard applicable \nin security clearance decisions is that articulated in Egan, supra. \u201cAny doubt \nconcerning personnel being considered for access to classified information \nwill be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d Directive, Enclosure 2 \u00b6 \n2(b).  \n \nISCR Case No. 10-04641 at 4 (App. Bd. Sept. 24, 2013).  \n \nApplicant\u2019s mother and father are dual citizens of the United States and Syria. His \nparents currently live in Syria. Applicant\u2019s spouse and parents-in-law are citizens and \nresidents of Syria. Applicant\u2019s spouse lives with her parents. Applicant has frequent \ncontact with his parents and spouse. Applicant went to Syria twice in 2018 and twice in \n2019. \n \n\n \n12                                        \n \n \nA key factor in the AG \u00b6 8(b) analysis is Applicant\u2019s \u201cdeep and longstanding \nrelationships and loyalties in the U.S.\u201d Applicant has significant connections to the United \nStates. He was born in the United States. He lived in the United States from 1985 to 1991, \nfrom 2001 to 2004, and from 2012 to present. He is credited with residency in the United \nStates while he served in Afghanistan for 13 months. Applicant has two brothers and one \nsister. The two brothers live in the United States. His sister recently moved from Saudi \nArabia to the UAE. Her husband works for an American company. None of Applicant\u2019s \nsiblings have worked for the Syrian government or military. \n \nApplicant\u2019s support to the DOD in Afghanistan, including the dangers that service \nentailed, weighs towards mitigation of security concerns. Applicant seeks a security \nclearance to enable him to continue providing assistance to DOD. He has shown his \npatriotism, loyalty, and fidelity to the United States during his support to DOD while serving \nin Afghanistan.  \n \nIn ISCR Case No. 17-00629 at 4 (App. Bd. May 24, 2018), the Appeal Board \ncogently explained the relevance of such service on behalf of the United States: \n \nSuch evidence demonstrates that Applicant has repeatedly been willing to \nassume a high level of risk on behalf of the U.S. and shows his ties and \nsense of obligation to the U.S. could be sufficiently strong enough to support \na favorable application of mitigating condition 8(b). See ISCR Case No. 05-\n03846 at 6 (App. Bd. Nov 14, 2006) (An applicant\u2019s work in support of U.S. \nforces in Afghanistan occurred \u201cin the context of dangerous high-risk \ncircumstances in which [he] made a significant contribution to national \nsecurity.\u201d) See also ISCR Case No. 04-12363 at 2 (App. Bd. Jul. 14, 2006); \nISCR Case No. 07-00034 at 2-3 (App. Bd. Feb. 5, 2008); and ISCR Case \nNo. 10-02803 at 6 (App. Bd. Mar. 19, 2012).  \n \nApplicant\u2019s relationship with the United States must be weighed against the \npotential conflict of interest created by his relationships with relatives who are citizens \nand residents of Syria. Applicant has close relationships with family in that country, and \nthey are at risk from criminals, terrorists, and human rights violations of the Syrian \ngovernment.  \n \nIt is important to be mindful of the United States\u2019 huge historical investment of \nmanpower and money in the Middle East. Applicant\u2019s support to DOD can contribute to \nthe accomplishment of DOD\u2019s goals and missions in the Middle East. Weighing against \napproval of access to classified information are Applicant\u2019s family members living in Syria, \nand they are potential targets of terrorists and the Syrian government. Applicant\u2019s access \nto classified information could theoretically add risk to his relatives living in Syria.    \n \nIn sum, Applicant\u2019s connections to his relatives living in Syria are too significant to \nmitigate the circumstances Applicant presented. His connections to the United States \ntaken together, while important, are not sufficient to overcome the foreign influence \nsecurity concerns under Guideline B.  \n \n\n \n13                                        \n \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), \u201c[t]he ultimate determination\u201d of whether to grant a security \nclearance \u201cmust be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines\u201d and the whole-person concept. My comments under Guideline B are \nincorporated in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were \naddressed under that guideline but some warrant additional comment. \n \nApplicant is a 34-year-old information technology security officer. Applicant has \nimportant connections to the United States that weigh towards granting his security \nclearance. He was born in the United States. He lived in the United States a total of about \n16 years. As indicated previously, Applicant\u2019s support to the DOD in Afghanistan, including \nthe dangers that service entailed, weighs towards mitigation of security concerns. His \nparents are citizens of the United States. His brothers are citizens and residents of the \nUnited States. Applicant is patriotic, diligent, responsible, and dedicated to mission \naccomplishment. Applicant is conscientious about maintenance of security. His supervisor \nand personal representative support his access to classified information. He is a loyal U.S. \ncitizen. He honestly and sincerely described his love and support for the United States.       \n \nA Guideline B decision concerning Syria must take into consideration the \ngeopolitical situation and dangers in those countries. See ISCR Case No. 04-02630 at 3 \n(App. Bd. May 23, 2007) (remanding because of insufficient discussion of geopolitical \nsituation and suggesting expansion of whole-person discussion). Syria is a dangerous \nplace because of violence from terrorists and criminals, the ongoing civil war, and the \nSyrian government does not respect the full spectrum of human rights. Syria is an ally of \nIran and opposes the interests of the United States. Terrorists, criminals, and the Syrian \ngovernment continue to threaten the interests of the United States, U.S. Armed Forces, \nand those who cooperate and assist the United States.   \n \nI have carefully applied the law, as set forth in Department of Navy v. Egan, 484 \nU.S. 518 (1988), Exec. Or. 10865, the Directive, and the AGs, to the facts and \ncircumstances in the context of the whole person. I conclude foreign influence security \nconcerns are not mitigated. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n\n \n14                                        \n \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:          \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline B:    \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a and 1.b: \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.c:  \n \n \nWithdrawn \nSubparagraphs 1.d, 1.e, and 1.f: \nAgainst Applicant  \nSubparagraph 1.g:  \n \n \nWithdrawn  \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact The SOR alleges under Guideline F that, as of the June 12, 2019 SOR, Applicant owed charged-off debts of $29,925 (SOR \u00b6 1.a) and $18,124 (SOR \u00b6 1.b). When Applicant answered the SOR allegations, he admitted the debts, explaining that they had been included in a debt-repayment program but had not been resolved when he withdrew from the program in February 2017 after settling a smaller credit-card delinquency. He explained that he realized then that the program was \u201cuseless\u201d in that it would take him years to accrue enough money to pay off the two large delinquencies. (Items 2-3.) After considering the FORM, which includes Applicant\u2019s Answer to the SOR, and Applicant\u2019s responses to the FORM (AEs A-B), I make the following findings of fact. Applicant is a 55-year-old high school graduate. He has been married to his current spouse since January 2001. He was married to his first wife from May 1985 to May 1996. He has a son age 30 and a daughter age 32. He also has two stepdaughters ages 33 and 27. (Items 4-5.) Applicant retired from the U.S. military at the rank of sergeant first class on October 1, 2010, after three years in the U.S. Reserve and 24 years of active duty.

He has had no success in obtaining the funds needed to resolve \nthe debts. His financial situation continues to raise security concerns. Clearance is denied. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \n \nOn June 12, 2019, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications Facility \n(DOD CAF) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant, detailing security concerns \nunder Guideline F, financial considerations. The SOR explained why the DOD CAF was \nunable to find it clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue security \nclearance eligibility for him. The DOD CAF took the action under Executive Order (EO) \n10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as \namended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review \nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the National Security Adjudicative \nGuidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information or Eligibility to \nHold a Sensitive Position (AG) effective within the DOD on June 8, 2017. \n \n\n2 \n \nOn June 27, 2019, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations and requested a \ndecision based on the written record in lieu of a hearing. On July 25, 2019, the Government \nsubmitted a File of Relevant Material (FORM), consisting of seven exhibits (Items 1-7). \nDOHA forwarded a copy of the FORM to Applicant on July 26, 2019, and instructed him \nthat any response was due within 30 days of receipt. Applicant received the FORM on \nAugust 2, 2019. He submitted timely responses on August 15, 2019, and August 20, 2019, \nto which the Government had no objections. On September 11, 2019, the case was \nassigned to me to determine whether it is clearly consistent with the interests of national \nsecurity to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant. I received the case file on \nSeptember 17, 2019, and accepted into the record Applicant\u2019s responses to the FORM as \nApplicant exhibits (AEs) A and B.  \n \nEvidentiary Ruling \n \n \n  \n \nDepartment Counsel submitted, as Item 5, a summary report of a personal subject \ninterview (PSI) of Applicant conducted on December 10, 2018. The summary report was \npart of the DOD Report of Investigation (ROI) in Applicant\u2019s case. Under \u00b6 E3.1.20 of the \nDirective, a DOD personnel background report of investigation may be received in \nevidence and considered with an authenticating witness, provided it is otherwise admissible \nunder the Federal Rules of Evidence. The summary report did not bear the authentication \nrequired for admissibility under \u00b6 E3.1.20. \n  \nIn ISCR Case No. 16-03126 decided on January 24, 2018, the Appeal Board held \nthat it was not error for an administrative judge to admit and consider a summary of \npersonal subject interview where the applicant was placed on notice of his or her \nopportunity to object to consideration of the summary; the applicant filed no objection to it; \nand there is no indication that the summary contained inaccurate information. In this case, \nApplicant was provided a copy of the FORM and advised of his opportunity to submit \nobjections or material that he wanted the administrative judge to consider. In footnote 1 of \nthe FORM, Applicant was advised as follows:  \n  \nIMPORTANT NOTICE TO APPLICANT: The attached summary of your \nPersonal Subject Interview (PSI) (Item 3) [sic] is being provided to the \nAdministrative Judge for consideration as part of the record evidence in this \ncase. In your response to this File of Relevant Material (FORM), you can \ncomment on whether the PSI summary accurately reflects the information \nyou provided to the authorized OPM investigator(s) and you can make any \ncorrections, additions, deletions, and updates necessary to make the \nsummary clear and accurate. Alternatively, you can object on the ground that \nthe report is unauthenticated by a Government witness. If no objections are \nraised in your response to the FORM, or if you do not respond to the FORM, \nthe Administrative Judge may determine that you have waived any objections \nto the admissibility of the summary and may consider the summary as \nevidence in your case. \n  \n\n3 \n \n Concerning whether Applicant understood the meaning of authentication or the \nlegal consequences of waiver, Applicant\u2019s pro se status does not confer any due process \nrights or protections beyond those afforded him if he was represented by legal counsel. He \nwas advised in \u00b6 E3.1.4 of the Directive that he may request a hearing. In \u00b6 E3.1.15, he \nwas advised that he is responsible for presenting evidence to rebut, explain, or mitigate \nfacts admitted by him or proven by Department Counsel and that he has the ultimate \nburden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision. While the Directive \ndoes not specifically provide for a waiver of the authentication requirement, Applicant was \nplaced on sufficient notice of his opportunity to object to the admissibility of the interview \nsummary report, to comment on the interview summary, and to make any corrections, \ndeletions, or updates to the information in the report. In his response to the FORM, \nApplicant did not object to the PSI or indicate that the summary report contained inaccurate \ninformation. I accepted Item 5 in evidence, subject to issues of relevance and materiality in \nlight of the entire record. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nThe SOR alleges under Guideline F that, as of the June 12, 2019 SOR, Applicant \nowed charged-off debts of $29,925 (SOR \u00b6 1.a) and $18,124 (SOR \u00b6 1.b). When Applicant \nanswered the SOR allegations, he admitted the debts, explaining that they had been \nincluded in a debt-repayment program but had not been resolved when he withdrew from \nthe program in February 2017 after settling a smaller credit-card delinquency. He explained \nthat he realized then that the program was \u201cuseless\u201d in that it would take him years to \naccrue enough money to pay off the two large delinquencies. (Items 2-3.) After considering \nthe FORM, which includes Applicant\u2019s Answer to the SOR, and Applicant\u2019s responses to \nthe FORM (AEs A-B), I make the following findings of fact. \n \nApplicant is a 55-year-old high school graduate. He has been married to his current \nspouse since January 2001. He was married to his first wife from May 1985 to May 1996. \nHe has a son age 30 and a daughter age 32. He also has two stepdaughters ages 33 and \n27. (Items 4-5.) \n \nApplicant retired from the U.S. military at the rank of sergeant first class on October \n1, 2010, after three years in the U.S. Reserve and 24 years of active duty. He was granted \na secret clearance following a security clearance investigation completed in approximately \nApril 1998. In November 2009, his security clearance eligibility was revoked for financial \nreasons. Applicant\u2019s clearance was reinstated in 2010 after he paid off some old bills from \nhis divorce.  (Items 2, 4.) \n \nFor the first year after his retirement, Applicant worked for a defense contractor as a \nhuman resource specialist in Afghanistan. Since November 2011, he has been employed \nby a defense contractor in the United States as a subject matter expert on the GI bill. \n(Items 2, 4.) Applicant\u2019s worksite from November 2011 to June 2015 was on a military base \nin another state. He stayed in a hotel during the work week and returned home on the \nweekends. Applicant has primarily teleworked out of his home since June 2015.  (Item 4.) \n\n4 \n \nIn addition to his employment income, he receives disability pay from the Department of \nVeterans Affairs (VA) and his military pension. (Item 2.) \n  \nOn January 17, 2018, Applicant completed and certified to the accuracy of a \nQuestionnaire for National Security Positions (SF 86) to update his security clearance \neligibility. He responded affirmatively to financial record inquiries concerning whether he \nhad an account or credit card suspended, charged off, or cancelled in the last seven years \nfor failing to pay as agreed; whether he had defaulted on any loan in the last seven years; \nand whether he had any bills turned over to a collection agency in the last seven years. He \nreported that he owed a credit-card debt of $18,000 in collection (SOR \u00b6 1.b) that he \nattempted to resolve, but he could not afford the payment required by the collection entity. \nHe also disclosed that he had defaulted on a loan of $29,000 (SOR \u00b6 1.a) that was in \ncollection status, and explained: \n \nEntered into debt relief Freedom Debt Relief (FDR), required to pay money \ninto an account that does NOT pay the main creditor directly until you have \nenough money in an account to cover about 20%, thus the loan became \ndelinquent. I withdrew to pay on my own. I attempted [on] several occasions \nto settle account but could not afford their unreasonable offer. \n \n \nAs for the current status of the loan debt, Applicant stated, \u201cStill with collection, \nlatest offer is a full amount of $11,969.86 which I cannot afford.\u201d He indicated he had made \nno payments on the debt. (Item 4.) \n \nApplicant\u2019s credit report of February 6, 2018, showed the delinquent credit-card \naccount had been charged off for $18,124 in February 2017. He owed $29,925 on the \ndefaulted loan, which had been charged off for $27,463 in October 2016. Applicant had \nsettled a credit-card collection debt of $1,014 in November 2016. He was making timely \npayments on a credit card with a $4,174 balance, and on four installment loans with \nbalances totaling $35,506.  (Item 7.) \n \nOn December 10, 2018, Applicant was interviewed by an OPM investigator. He \ndescribed his financial situation as \u201cgood\u201d and stated that he was meeting all his financial \nobligations. About his two large delinquencies disclosed on his SF 86, he explained that he \nattempted to resolve the $18,124 credit-card delinquency through the debt-repayment \nprogram, but that the creditor wanted too much to settle the debt. He had acquired the \n$29,925 loan to consolidate his debts, but he then could not afford to settle the debt. While \nacknowledging that he had settled a smaller credit-card debt through the debt-repayment \nprogram, he stated that he should never have attempted to address his debts through the \nprogram because \u201cthe plan had no end in sight.\u201d He explained that he had accrued the \ncredit balances for family vacations, and for his living and travel expenses while living apart \nfrom his family. (Item 5.) \n \nApplicant\u2019s credit reports of February 2018 and May 2019 reveal a history since \n2013 of reliance on loans, in some cases taking on higher debt in refinancing. (Items 6-7.) \nIn April 2018, he paid off a $27,088 loan by refinancing for a new loan of $20,522, requiring \n\n5 \n \nrepayment at $868 per month. As of May 2019, he was making his loan payments on time. \nHe was also making payments of $279 per month on a $15,000 loan obtained in \nSeptember 2015 (balance $7,332 as of May 2019). In January 2019, he paid off a $3,137 \nloan held since July 2018 through a refinancing for a new loan of $7,008, requiring \nrepayment at $330 per month. That loan had a reported balance of $7,280 as of May 2019, \nso it is unclear whether he had started repaying that newer loan. Applicant was making \npayments on two credit cards with balances of $5,815 and $1,568. He had no new \ndelinquencies on his credit record, but he had not made any payments toward the charged-\noff debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b. (Item 6.)  \n \nOn June 12, 2019, the DOD CAF issued an SOR to Applicant because of his \ncharged-off debts totaling $48,049. (Item 1.) On June 27, 2019, Applicant explained about \nthe debt-repayment program that he did not realize that his payments into the program \nwere held until he reached an amount that was enough to pay off a debt, and that \npayments were not being disbursed to each of the creditors on a monthly basis. While he \nmanaged to resolve one credit-card debt through the program, he withdrew from the \nprogram in February 2017 because it would take him years to accumulate enough money \nin his account to pay off the debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b. Applicant asserted that he lived \nwithin his means and was paying all of his current debts. (Item 2.) \n  \nOn his receipt of the FORM on August 2, 2019, Applicant contacted the collection \nentities handling his defaulted accounts. He received settlement offers of $10,473 for his \nloan debt (SOR \u00b6 1.a) and $9,968 for the credit-card debt (SOR \u00b6 1.b). The payment to \nsettle the loan was due on or before August 9, 2019. Applicant immediately requested a \nhardship withdrawal of $23,000 from his 401(k), which would net him approximately \n$21,352 after taxes and fees. On August 9, 2019, he was denied a hardship withdrawal \nbecause debt settlement was not a reason approved by the IRS for a hardship withdrawal. \nApplicant also attempted to obtain a loan from his bank, but it was disapproved. He asked \nfriends and family members for some financial assistance to no avail. On August 15, 2019, \nhe advised DOHA that he had \u201cexhausted all possible avenues\u201d regarding resolving the \ndebts, but he would continue to remain in contact with the collection entities about the \ndebts. (AE A.) On August 20, 2019, Applicant informed DOHA that the collection entity for \nthe credit-card debt (SOR \u00b6 1.b) was willing to accept 12 monthly payments to settle the \ndebt, but the monthly payment of approximately $830 \u201cis quite a steep amount to pay \nmonthly for [his] budget.\u201d He reiterated that he would remain in contact with his creditors. \n(AE B.) Applicant presented no information about his employment income, his military \nretirement income, or his monthly living expenses, so it is unclear what he could pay \ntoward his delinquencies.  \n \nPolicies \n \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion the Executive \nBranch has in regulating access to information pertaining to national security,  emphasizing \nthat \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 \nU.S. 518, 528 (1988). When evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, \nthe administrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \n\n6 \n \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are required to be considered in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. These guidelines \nare not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, \nthese guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative \nprocess. The administrative judge\u2019s overall adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious \nscrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative \njudge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, \nfavorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence \nto establish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant \nis responsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation about potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Section 7 of EO 10865 \nprovides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a \ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section \n3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information). \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \n \n \nThe security concerns about financial considerations are articulated in AG \u00b6 18: \n \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness \nto abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about an \nindividual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified or \nsensitive information. Financial distress can also be caused or exacerbated \nby, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other issues of personnel security \nconcern such as excessive gambling, mental health conditions, substance \n\n7 \n \nmisuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An individual who is financially \noverextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or otherwise \nquestionable acts to generate funds. . . . \n \n \nAn applicant is not required to be debt free, but is required to manage his finances \nin a way as to exhibit sound judgment and responsibility. The Appeal Board explained the \nscope and rationale for the financial considerations security concern in ISCR Case No. 11-\n05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012) (citation omitted) as follows: \n \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an applicant might knowingly \ncompromise classified information in order to raise money in satisfaction of \nhis or her debts. Rather, it requires a Judge to examine the totality of an \napplicant\u2019s financial history and circumstances. The Judge must consider \npertinent evidence regarding the applicant\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other \nqualities essential to protecting the national secrets as well as the \nvulnerabilities inherent in the circumstances. The Directive presumes a \nnexus between proven conduct under any of the Guidelines and an \napplicant\u2019s security eligibility. \n \nApplicant relied on consumer credit to pay some expenses while living apart from his \nfamily for his job during the work weeks from November 2011 until June 2015. Despite \ntelecommuting and so not having to pay lodging and travel costs, he stopped paying on the \ncredit card in SOR \u00b6 1.b, and an $18,124 balance was charged off in July 2016. A loan \nobtained in March 2016 to pay off debts was charged off in October 2016 for $27,463. He \nnow owes $29,925 on the defaulted loan. Disqualifying conditions AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a), \u201cinability to \nsatisfy debts,\u201d and 19(c),\u201d a history of not meeting financial obligations,\u201d are established. \n \nThe burden is on Applicant to mitigate the negative implications for his financial \njudgment raised by the delinquent debts. Application of the aforesaid disqualifying \nconditions triggers consideration of the potentially mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20. \nOne or more of the following conditions may apply in whole or in part: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under \nsuch circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the \nindividual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem from a \nlegitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit counseling service, \nand there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under \ncontrol; and \n\n8 \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \n \nRegarding AG \u00b6 20(a), the debts were not incurred in circumstances that can \nreasonably be characterized as unique. Applicant benefitted from the credit extended to \nhim, and he has yet to make any payments toward the delinquencies. The debts are \nconsidered recent because \u201can applicant\u2019s ongoing, unpaid debts evidence a continuing \ncourse of conduct and, therefore, can be viewed as recent for purposes of the Guideline F \nmitigating conditions.\u201d ISCR Case No. 15-06532 at 3 (App. Bd. Feb. 16, 2017) (citing ISCR \nCase No. 15-01690 at 2 (App. Bd. Sept. 13, 2016)).  \n \n \nApplicant has not provided information showing that the debts were caused by \nunexpected or unforeseen factors contemplated within AG \u00b6 20(b). Even assuming that he \nhad extra costs for his lodging, food, and trips home to see his family for several years, \nthose costs were knowingly incurred and within his control. Moreover, I have to consider \nwhether Applicant acted in a reasonable manner when dealing with his financial difficulties. \nSee ISCR Case No. 05-11366 at 4, n.9 (App. Bd. Jan. 12, 2007) (citing ISCR Case No. 99-\n0462 at 4 (App. Bd. May 25, 2000); ISCR Case No. 99-0012 at 4 (App. Bd. Dec. 1, 1999); \nISCR Case No. 03-13096 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 29, 2005)). A component is whether \nApplicant maintained contact with his creditors. Applicant tried to resolve the debts through \na debt-repayment program in 2016, and he managed to settle a smaller credit-card debt \nthrough the program in November 2016. Yet, there is no evidence of more recent attempts \nto settle or resolve his larger delinquencies before August 2, 2019, when he contacted the \ncollection entities to arrange for settlements that he apparently cannot afford. AG \u00b6 20(b) is \nnot clearly established. \n \n \nSome consideration of AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(c) and 20(d) is warranted because of the debt-\nrepayment plan, but the lack of documented progress toward resolving the debts after he \nwithdrew from the debt-repayment program undermines his case in mitigation. He \npresented no documentation of any efforts on his part to address his delinquencies \nbetween February 2017 and August 2, 2019, when he contacted his creditors after he \nreceived the FORM. His recent efforts to obtain settlement offers is viewed favorably, but \nhe has yet to make any payments because he cannot meet the terms. He indicated on \nAugust 20, 2019, that the $830 monthly payment required to settle the credit-card \ndelinquency would be \u201ca steep amount to pay monthly for [his] budget.\u201d He was not \nsuccessful in obtaining a hardship withdrawal from his 401(k) or borrowing from friends or \nfamily members. \n \nThe Appeal Board has long held that \u201ca security clearance adjudication is not a \nproceeding aimed at collecting an applicant\u2019s personal debts.\u201d See ISCR Case No. 09-\n02160 at 5 (App. Bd. June 21, 2010). An applicant is not required to establish that he has \npaid off each debt in the SOR, or even that the first debts paid be those in the SOR. See \nISCR Case No. 07-06482 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008). However, the Appeal Board recently \nreiterated in ADP Case No. 17-0063 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2018) that \u201can applicant must \ndemonstrate a plan for debt repayment, accompanied by concomitant conduct, that is, \nconduct that evidences a serious intent to resolve the debts.\u201d Applicant does not have a \n\n9 \n \nsignificant history of late payments on his other debts. In that regard, he has demonstrated \nsome financial responsibility. However, in evaluating his financial situation overall, I cannot \nignore that he has taken on several loans over the years as his charged-off delinquencies \ntotaling $48,049 go unpaid. Available credit information shows that he paid off a $27,088 \nloan in April 2018 by refinancing for a new loan of $20,522 requiring repayment at $868 per \nmonth. In January 2019, he refinanced a $3,137 loan for a new loan of $7,008. Applicant \nasserts that his current expenses are being paid on time, but he has also relied on \nunsecured loans to meet his finances. He provided no details about his income or \nexpenses. Too many unanswered questions exist about his present financial situation, and \nhe has made no progress toward resolving the debts in the SOR. For the reasons noted, \nthe financial considerations security concerns are not sufficiently mitigated. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of her conduct and \nall relevant circumstances in light of the nine adjudicative process factors in AG \u00b6 2(d): \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances \nsurrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the \nfrequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at \nthe time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which participation is voluntary; (6) \nthe presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral \nchanges; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, \ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or \nrecurrence. \n \n \nApplicant requested a decision on the written record, so it was incumbent on him to \nprovide the evidence that might extenuate or mitigate the poor judgment raised by his \n$48,049 in outstanding delinquent debt. Although Applicant now expresses a credible \nwillingness to resolve his debts, it is well settled that once a concern arises regarding an \napplicant\u2019s security clearance eligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or \nrenewal of a security clearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th Cir. \n1990). After applying the disqualifying and mitigating conditions to the evidence presented, \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue \nsecurity clearance eligibility for Applicant. \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.b: \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n\n10 \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue eligibility for a security \nclearance for Applicant. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n________________________ \nElizabeth M. Matchinski \nAdministrative Judge \n \n",

Folks, Esq., Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro se \n \n \nNovember 18, 2019 \n______________ \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \n \nLokey Anderson, Darlene D., Administrative Judge: \n \nOn September 26, 2018, Applicant submitted a security clearance application (e-\nQIP). (Government Exhibit 3.)  On June 14, 2019, the Department of Defense \nConsolidated Adjudications Facility (DoD CAF) issued Applicant a Statement of \nReasons (SOR), detailing security concerns under Guideline J, Criminal Conduct; and \nGuideline H, Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse. The action was taken under \nExecutive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry \n(February 20, 1960), as amended; DoD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel \nSecurity Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and \nthe Adjudicative Guidelines, effective within the DoD after June 8, 2017.  \n \n \nApplicant answered the SOR on July 5, 2019.  He requested that his case be \ndecided by an administrative judge on the written record without a hearing. (Item 2.)  On \nAugust 22, 2019, Department Counsel submitted the Government\u2019s written case. A \ncomplete copy of the File of Relevant Material (FORM), containing six Items, was \nmailed to Applicant on August 23, 2019, and received by him on September 4, 2019.  \nThe FORM notified Applicant that he had an opportunity to file objections and submit \nmaterial in refutation, extenuation, or mitigation within 30 days of his receipt of the \n\n \n2 \n \nFORM. Applicant responded to the FORM. Applicant did not object to Items 1 through 6, \nand they are admitted into evidence, hereinafter referenced as Government Exhibits 1 \nthrough 6.  The Government also requested that the administrative judge take judicial or \nadministrative notice of the criminal Code of Virginia, Sections 18.2-250.1 for \nPossession of Marijuana; and Section 54.1-3466, Possession or Distribution of \nControlled Paraphernalia.  There was no objection by Applicant, and accordingly, \nadministrative notice of these two sections of the Virginia Criminal Code was taken.   \n \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant is 23 years old, and unmarried.  He has a high school diploma.  He is \nemployed by a defense contractor as a maintenance electrician.  He is seeking to obtain \na security clearance in connection with his employment.    \n \nGuideline J \u2013 Criminal Conduct  \n \n \nThe Government alleges that Applicant has engaged in criminal activity that \ncreates doubt about a person\u2019s judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness and calls into \nquestion a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations. \n \nGuideline H - Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \n \n \nThe Government alleges that the Applicant has used controlled substances that \ncause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner inconsistent with their \nintended purpose, which can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability and \ntrustworthiness.   \n \n \nAfter graduation from high school, in July 2014, Applicant began working in an \napprenticeship at a Navy shipyard as a maintenance electrician.  (Government Exhibit \n3.)  In 2016, he applied for a security clearance, which was granted.  (Government \nExhibit 4.)  Applicant states that in October 2017, he was riding as a passenger in his \ncar with two friends when the police stopped the car for speeding.  The officer smelled \nTHC and reported seeing marijuana residue in the console of the vehicle.  The officer \nasked to search the vehicle and found a small bag of THC in the back seat area.  \nInitially neither Applicant nor his friends admitted ownership of the THC.  The officer told \nApplicant and his friends that he would ticket all of them unless someone took \nresponsibility.  Applicant then admitted ownership of the THC, not because it was his, \nbut because the car was his, and he did not want to sit on the side of the road all day.  \nApplicant claims that the THC was actually his friend\u2019s.  The officer issued Applicant a \nsummons and when Applicant appeared in court he was charged with Misdemeanor \nPossession of Marijuana.  (Government Exhibit 1.)  In November 2017, Applicant was \nfound guilty of Possession/Distribution of Controlled Drug Paraphernalia and ordered to \npay a fine and costs.  (Government Exhibits 5 and 6.)     \n \n\n \n3 \n \nApplicant claims that he did not know that he was pleading guilty to a drug \ncharge because he did not have an attorney.  He instead thought that he was pleading \nguilty to a traffic violation.  (Government Exhibit 6.)  The court records indicate \notherwise.  (Government Exhibit 5.) \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious \nscrutiny of a number of variables known as the whole-person concept. The \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. \n  \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.14, requires the Government to present evidence that \nestablishes controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the \n\u201capplicant is responsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, \nextenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, \nand has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance \ndecision.\u201d  \n \n \nA person who applies for access to classified information seeks to enter into a \nfiduciary relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n \n\n \n4 \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \n \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline J: Criminal Conduct \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Criminal Conduct is set out in AG \n\u00b6 30: \n \nCriminal activity creates doubt about a person\u2019s judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person\u2019s ability \nor willingness to comply with laws, rules and regulations. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 31 describes a condition that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. The following is potentially applicable:  \n \n(b) evidence (including, but not limited to, a credible allegation, an \nadmission, and matters of official record) of criminal conduct, regardless of \nwhether the individual was formally charged, prosecuted, or convicted.   \n \nApplicant claims that the marijuana was not his when he received a citation for \nPossession of Marijuana.  This argument does not fly.  It does not follow logically that a \nperson would take responsibility for illegal conduct just because that conduct occurred \non their property.  Furthermore, given the fact that Applicant held a security clearance at \nthe time of the citation, even assuming that Applicant was not using the marijuana and \nthe marijuana was not his, he should never have been around illegal drugs in the first \nplace.  Applicant should have avoided any environment where illegal drugs were used, \nand they should never have been permitted in his car.  It is also puzzling why Applicant \nwas riding as a passenger in his own car at this time the THC permeated the car.  \nApplicant is young and immature and used poor judgment.  Under the circumstances, \nthe aforementioned disqualifying conditions have been established.  \n \nFour Criminal Conduct mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 32 are potentially \napplicable:  \n \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur \nand does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, trustworthiness, or \ngood judgment; \n \n(b) the individual was pressured or coerced into committing the act and \nthose pressures are no longer present in the person\u2019s life; \n \n\n \n5 \n \n(c) no reliable evidence to support that the individual committed the \noffense; and  \n \n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including, but not limited \nto the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, restitution, \ncompliance with the terms of parole or probation, job training or higher \neducation, \ngood \nemployment \nrecord, \nor \nconstructive \ncommunity \ninvolvement. \n \nThe evidence in this case does not establish mitigation.  Applicant\u2019s conviction \nfor Possession or Distribution of Controlled Paraphernalia is recent, as it occurred just \ntwo years ago.  He was not pressured by anyone to engage in this illegal conduct, nor is \nthere any real evidence of successful rehabilitation.  Applicant\u2019s conduct shows \nimmaturity and creates doubt concerning his judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness, \nand ability or willingness to abide by law, rules, and regulations.  None of the mitigating \nconditions establish full mitigation.  \n \nGuideline H: Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Drug Involvement and \nSubstance Misuse is set forth at AG \u00b6 24: \n \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual's reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior \nmay lead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. Controlled substance means any \"controlled substance\" \nas defined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term \nadopted in this guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above. \n \nThe guideline at AG \u00b6 25 contains two conditions that could raise a security \nconcern and may be disqualifying: \n \n(a) any substance misuse (see above definition);  \n \n(c) illegal possession of a controlled substance, including cultivation, \nprocessing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of \ndrug paraphernalia.  \n \nThe guideline at AG \u00b6 26 contains conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns.  None of the conditions are applicable: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \n\n \n6 \n \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \nand \n \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this \nproblem, and has established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not \nlimited to: \n \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts;  \n \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were \nused; and  \n \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all \ndrug involvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that \nany future involvement or misuse is grounds for revocation \nof national security eligibility. \n \n \nNone of the mitigating factors demonstrate full mitigation.  Applicant has not \npresented convincing evidence to show that he has stopped using illegal drugs, or that \nhe has dissociated himself from his drug using friends, or that he has changed his \nenvironment.  Nor has he provided a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug \nuse in the future.  At this time, his actions do not show the requisite maturity, good \njudgment, reliability and trustworthiness necessary to be eligible for access to classified \ninformation.        \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept.  \n \n\n \n7 \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline J and Guideline H in my whole-person analysis. Applicant\u2019s recent charge in \nOctober 2017, with Possession of Marijuana, a misdemeanor, followed by his conviction \nin November 2017, when he was found guilty of Possession/Distribution of Controlled \nDrug Paraphernalia, a misdemeanor, is inconsistent with being cleared for access to \nclassified information.  More time is needed without criminal conduct or drug \ninvolvement to sufficiently guarantee the Government that the Applicant is mature and \nresponsible enough to access classified information.  Based upon the facts here, \nAppellant does not meet the qualifications for a security clearance.          \n  \nTo hold a security clearance is a privilege and not a right.  While holding a \nsecurity clearance one is expected to show honesty, responsibility and good judgment \nat all times.  Applicant has not demonstrated a positive pattern of conduct and the level \nof maturity needed for access to classified information.  At this time, he is not an \nindividual with whom the Government can be confident to know that he will always \nfollow rules and regulations and do the right thing, even when no one is looking.  Right \nnow, he is not qualified for access to classified information, nor is it certain that sensitive \ninformation will be properly protected.   \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with many questions and doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant failed to mitigate the Criminal Conduct and Drug Involvement and \nSubstance Abuse security concerns.    \n \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline J:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline H:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n8 \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant national security eligibility \nfor a security clearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n \n \nDarlene Lokey Anderson \nAdministrative Judge \n",
