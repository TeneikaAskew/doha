Mendez, Esq., Chief Department Counsel \nFOR APPLICANT \nPro se \nThe Department of Defense (DoD) declined to grant Applicant a security clearance. On \nJune 14, 2023, DoD issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the basis of that \ndecision \u2013 security concerns raised under Guideline H (Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse) \nof the National Security Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) in Appendix A of Security Executive Agent \nDirective 4 (effective June 8, 2017) and DoD Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) \n(Directive).

On March 5, 2024, after conducting a hearing, Defense \nOffice of Hearings and Appeals Administrative Judge Roger C. Wesley denied Applicant\u2019s \nsecurity clearance eligibility. Applicant appealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30. \nThe SOR initially alleged under Guideline H that Applicant used methamphetamine with \nvarying frequency from June to December 1995; marijuana with varying frequency from 2009 \nthrough approximately 2010; and hallucinogenic mushrooms with varying frequency from about \nMarch to May 2022. The SOR also alleged that Applicant assisted with the cultivation of marijuana \nin his home from about July 2021 to about August 2022 and that he was discharged from the U.S. \nNavy under other than honorable conditions (OTH) in 1996 after he tested positive for \ntetrahydrocannabinol (THC).

The written amendment was submitted to \nApplicant, who admitted the two Guideline E allegations. \nOn appeal, Applicant contends the Judge mischaracterized his drug use and made factual \nfindings that were not supported by the evidence. The Board agrees that the Judge made erroneous \nfindings of fact constituting harmful error. Additionally, the Board finds that the Judge failed to \nmake appropriate findings under Guideline E. Therefore, we remand the case back to the Judge \nfor corrective action as appropriate consistent with the Directive and the record evidence. \nJudge\u2019s Findings of Fact and Analysis \nApplicant is in his late-40s and has been employed by a defense contractor since August \n2022. He is married and has three children. He served in the U.S. Navy from 1993 until he was \ndischarged with an OTH in April 1996 after testing positive for THC. \nApplicant was introduced to methamphetamine in the Navy and used it with varying \nfrequency between June and December 1995 without appreciating the consequences until he tested \npositive and was discharged. He then had difficulty finding employment. Between 2009 and 2010, \nhe used marijuana on a couple of occasions. Between July 2021 and August 2022, he assisted his \nspouse in cultivating hallucinogenic mushrooms while using the drug a couple of times in 2022 to \nreduce anxiety and depression. He purchased supplies for growing the mushrooms. He and his \nspouse stopped their activities in August 2022 and committed to avoiding all illegal drug use and \ndrug cultivation. \nIn the Judge\u2019s analysis, he noted that Applicant\u2019s admissions to his involvement with \nmultiple illegal drugs (inclusive of use and aiding his wife in the cultivation of hallucinogenic \nmushrooms) raise security concerns including risk of recurrence and judgement. Applicant was \ncredited for abandoning all use and involvement with illegal drugs for almost two years. However, \nwith the combination of multiple uses of illegal drugs, along with his brief involvement with the \ncultivation of marijuana in 2022, it is still too soon to absolve Applicant of the risk of recurrence. \nWith only one-plus years of demonstrated abstinence from illegal drug involvement, more time \nwith more corroborating evidentiary sources to support his continued abstinence are needed to \nsafely predict the risk of future recurrence. \nDiscussion \nOn appeal, Applicant contends the Judge mischaracterized his drug use as \u201cwith varying \nfrequency\u201d without distinguishing the exact number of uses for each drug and made factual \nfindings that were not supported by the evidence. We agree that the Judge made findings and \nconclusions that are unsupported by the evidence. \nWhen an Administrative Judge\u2019s factual findings are challenged, the Board must determine \nwhether \u201c[t]he Administrative Judge\u2019s findings of fact are supported by such relevant evidence as \na reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion in light of all the contrary \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nevidence in the same record.\u201d Directive, E3.1.32.1. The Board must consider not only whether \nthere is record evidence supporting a Judge\u2019s findings, but also whether there is evidence that fairly \ndetracts from the weight of the evidence supporting those findings, and whether the Judge\u2019s \nfindings reflect a reasonable interpretation of the record evidence as a whole. ISCR Case No. 02\u00ad\n12199 at 2\u20133 (App. Bd. Aug. 8, 2005). \nIn deciding whether the Judge's rulings or conclusions are erroneous, we will review the \ndecision to determine whether: it does not examine relevant evidence; it fails to articulate a \nsatisfactory explanation for its conclusions, including a rational connection between the facts \nfound and the choice made; it does not consider relevant factors; it reflects a clear error of \njudgment; it fails to consider an important aspect of the case; it offers an explanation for the \ndecision that runs contrary to the record evidence; or it is so implausible that it cannot be ascribed \nto a mere difference of opinion. ISCR Case No. 97-0435 at 3 (App. Bd. Jul. 14, 1998). \nApplicant argues with the Judge\u2019s use of \u201cvarying frequency\u201d in describing his use of \nvarious drugs. He contends he used methamphetamine one time between June and December 1995; \nused marijuana one time in 1996 and twice between 2009 and 2010; and used hallucinogenic \nmushrooms four times between March and May 2022, after purchasing once and dividing it into \nfour doses. In addition, Applicant argues that he never assisted in the cultivation of hallucinogenic \nmushrooms, as found by the Judge. Rather, he contends that he assisted his spouse with cultivation \nof marijuana for her personal use and that he never used the marijuana grown. \nWe note that the record evidence is inconsistent with Applicant\u2019s current assertions with \nregard to the frequency of his drug use and that he admitted the SOR allegations that characterized \nhis uses as \u201cvarying frequency.\u201d See, e.g., Government Exhibit (GE) 2; SOR Answer (Ans.); Tr. \nHowever, we agree that some of the Judge\u2019s findings of fact and analyses are erroneous and not \nsupported by the record. In particular, the Judge made erroneous findings with regard to the \nassistance Applicant provided to his spouse for the cultivation of hallucinogenic mushrooms and \nhis personal use of the cultivated product. Decision at 3, 6. Notably, marijuana and its cultivation \nfor personal use are legal at the state level in Applicant\u2019s state of residence, while hallucinogenic \nmushrooms are not. In the context of this case, we cannot conclude that these errors were harmless, \ni.e., that they did not likely affect the outcome of the case. \nIn addition, we note that the Judge failed to properly characterize the amended SOR \nallegations by erroneously stating that they were amendments to the Guideline H allegations to \ninclude adding \u201cwhile in the U.S. Navy\u201d to SOR \u00b6 1.a. and italicizing \u201ctetrahydrocannabinol\u201d in \nSOR \u00b6 1.b. As noted above, the amended SOR actually added two allegations under Guideline E, \nand the Judge failed to make appropriate finding and conclusions with regard to those Guideline \nE allegations. \nIn light of the errors identified, above, the best resolution of this case is to remand it to \nthe Judge to correct the errors and for further processing consistent with the Directive and the \nrecord. Upon remand, a judge is required to issue a new decision. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.35. The Board \nretains no jurisdiction over a remanded decision. However, a judge\u2019s decision issued after \nremand may be appealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.130. \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nOrder \nThe decision is REMANDED. \nSigned: Moira Modzelewski \nMoira Modzelewski \nAdministrative Judge \nChair, Appeal Board \nSigned: Gregg A.

Applicant \nappealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30. \nUnder Guideline F, the SOR alleges that Applicant fraudulently withdrew about $9,700 \nfrom the bank account of a youth activities club between 2017 and 2019 and that she gambled in \nan effort to pay back the funds.

On \nApril 12, 2023, DoD issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the basis for that \ndecision \u2013 security concerns raised under Guideline B (Foreign Influence) of the National Security \nAdjudicative Guidelines (AG) of Security Executive Agent Directive 4 (effective June 8, 2017) \n(SEAD 4) and DoD Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive). Applicant requested \na hearing. On February 6, 2024, Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals Administrative Judge \nEric H. Borgstrom denied Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance. Applicant appealed \npursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30. \nThe SOR alleged that Applicant\u2019s parents and sister are citizens and residents of Iraq. It \nalso alleged that his two brothers are citizens of Iraq, one of whom resides in Finland and the other \nin the United Arab Emirates. The Judge found in favor of Applicant with respect to the concerns \nraised by his brother residing in Finland, but against him on the remaining Guideline B concerns. \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nOn appeal, Applicant asserts that the Judge failed to properly consider all available \nevidence and failed to properly apply the mitigating conditions and whole-person analysis, \nrendering his adverse decision arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law. For the reasons set forth \nbelow, we affirm. \nJudge\u2019s Findings of Fact and Analysis \nApplicant is in his early 40s and was born in Iraq where he was raised and earned a \nbachelor\u2019s degree in engineering. He subsequently worked for the Iraqi Ministry of Water \nResources and for private companies in the United Arab Emirates and Qatar. During that time, he \nmarried but divorced in 2021 after 10 years of marriage. He has two pre-teen children from that \nmarriage. His ex-wife is now a U.S. citizen but lives in Qatar with her children and new husband. \nApplicant moved to the United States in 2014 and was employed by various companies as an \nengineer. He became a naturalized U.S. citizen in 2018 and then moved back to Qatar that same \nyear. While in Qatar he was employed by a private company. He returned to the United States in \n2021, but later in the year he returned to Iraq to care for his parents. In July 2023, he moved back \nto the United States and obtained employment as an engineer. \nThe Judge took administrative notice of facts regarding Iraq including, among others, that \nthe U.S. Department of State has issued a Level 4 travel advisory due to terrorism, kidnapping, \narmed conflict, and civil unrest, and that terrorist organizations remain active in the country and \npose a threat to U.S. forces and citizens. \nThe Judge found that Applicant\u2019s relationships within the United States were insufficient \nto mitigate the close relationships with his parents and siblings who are citizens of a country where \nconditions create a heightened risk of exploitation. \nDiscussion \nApplicant\u2019s arguments on appeal can be parsed into three assignments of error, including \nthat the Judge failed to consider that Applicant\u2019s family themselves do not create a vulnerability \nof foreign pressure or coercion, that Applicant has limited contact with his family and therefore \nhas no potential conflict of interest, and that the Administrative Judge applied an analysis that \namounts to \u201ca de facto ban on U.S. citizens with family in Iraq from having a clearance.\u201d Appeal \nBrief (AB) at 3, fn 1. As discussed more thoroughly below, Applicant\u2019s arguments amount to a \ndisagreement with the Judge\u2019s weighing of the evidence, which is not sufficient to demonstrate \nthat the Judge weighed the evidence or reached conclusions in a manner that is arbitrary, \ncapricious, or contrary to law. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 06-17409 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct. 12, 2007). \nApplicant takes issue with the Judge\u2019s conclusion that the amount of contact he has with \nhis family members was not mitigating. However, he maintains weekly contact with his retired \nparents who reside in Baghdad, Iraq, and maintains monthly contact with his sister who lives in \nnorthern Iraq. He is in contact with his brother in the United Arab Emirates two or three times a \nyear. There is a rebuttable presumption that an applicant\u2019s relationship with immediate family \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \nmembers is not casual. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 07-13696 at 4 (App. Bd. Feb. 9, 2009). There is \nnothing in the record of this case that rebuts that presumption. For example, there is no evidence \nthat Applicant is estranged in any way from his foreign relatives with whom he describes his \nrelationship as \u201cnormal.\u201d Tr. at 43; Decision at 3. The totality of Applicant\u2019s contacts with his \nrelatives cannot be said to be casual. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 07-13696 at 4. The Judge\u2019s \nconclusion with regard to AG \u00b6 8(c) is supported by the evidence. \nThe concern in foreign influence cases arises from the nature of an applicant\u2019s foreign ties, \nwhich is not viewed in a vacuum. While frequency of contact is a factor to be considered in \nevaluating the concern, it alone is not dispositive. ISCR Case No. 22-00364 at 3 (App. Bd. Jun. \n22, 2023). It is of little consequence that relatives or friends may not have specific ties to the \nforeign government or be visible to that government. It is a well-established principle that \u201cthe \nrelative obscurity of foreign family members does not provide a meaningful measure of whether \nApplicant's circumstances pose a security risk.\u201d ISCR Case No. 17-03450 at 4 (App. Bd. Feb. 29, \n2019). \u201cRather, it is the nature of the ties themselves that raise a concern.\u201d ISCR Case No. 15\u00ad\n04389 at 3 (App. Bd. Feb. 27, 2018). This requires an assessment of the closeness of the ties and \nan accurate and current assessment of the geopolitical situation and intelligence/security profile of \nthe country vis-\u00e0-vis the United States. ISCR Case No. No.17-03026 at fn. 4 (App. Bd. Jan. 16, \n2019).  \nIt is well-established that the Government is not required to prove an actual threat of \nespionage. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 07-13696 at 5 (App. Bd. Feb. 9, 2009). Rather, there is a \nrational connection between an applicant\u2019s family ties and the risk that the applicant might fail to \nsafeguard classified information, even if that family has no connection with the foreign \ngovernment. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 01-26893 at 5 (App. Bd. Oct. 16, 2002) (\u201cMoreover, human \nexperience shows that people have engaged in espionage or committed deliberate security \nviolations for a broad range of reasons, including succumbing to threats made by a foreign entity \nagainst a third party for whom the target has ties of love or affection.\u201d). Here, the Judge reasonably \nfound that Applicant has longstanding family connections to Iraq, which given current geopolitical \ncircumstances presents a heightened risk, and concluded that Applicant failed to show it is unlikely \nhe will be placed in a position of having to choose between those connections and the interests of \nthe United States. \nApplicant also asserts that the Judge\u2019s findings of fact are unsupported because they rely \n\u201centirely on the State Department travel advisory.\u201d AB at 6-8. However this assertion is incorrect. \nRather than a one-dimensional analysis as claimed by Applicant, the Judge also specifically \naddressed other administratively-noticed facts and weighed them in the context of Applicant\u2019s \nfamily members and his ties to them, as well as considering Applicant\u2019s personal ties within the \nUnited States and other countries. Decision at 6-7. The Judge\u2019s conclusion with regard to AG \u00b6 \n8(a) is supported by the evidence. \nFinally, Applicant asserts that the Judge\u2019s analysis created a \u201cde facto\u201d bar to granting \nsecurity clearances to applicants with Iraqi family members. The Guidelines cannot be applied \nwith a per se rule that merely having close relatives in a particular foreign country must result in \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nan adverse security clearance decision without regard to any mitigating evidence or consideration \nof the whole person. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 99-0511 at 6 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2000) (rejecting an \nargument that would have the practical effect of establishing such a rule.) However, that was not \nhow the Judge approached this case. Instead, as required, he assessed all aspects of the facts and \ncircumstances of Applicant's ties and contacts with his Iraqi family members. See ISCR Case No. \n02-22461 at 5 (App. Bd. Oct. 27, 2005). Thus, the Judge\u2019s analysis was consistent with Directive \n\u00b6 8(b) which requires judges to balance an applicant\u2019s ties within the U.S. to his or her ties to a \nforeign person, organization, or country when analyzing the extent to which applicants might find \nthemselves in a conflict of interest. See ISCR Case No. 08-11788 at 5 (App. Bd. Jul. 28, 2010). \nThis analysis also must consider record evidence that detracts from the notion that an applicant's \nties to the United States are paramount. ISCR Case No. 06-24575 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 9, 2007). \nThe Judge correctly did so in this instance. There is no merit to Applicant's suggestion that the \nJudge applied such a per se rule when analyzing his case. See ISCR Case No. 02-09907 at 7 (App. \nBd. Mar. 17, 2004). \nWe have considered the entirety of the arguments contained in Applicant\u2019s appeal brief. \nThe record supports a conclusion that the Judge examined the relevant data and articulated a \nsatisfactory explanation for the decision, \u201cincluding a \u2018rational connection between the facts found \nand the choice made.\u2019\u201d Motor Vehicle Mfrs.

Mendez, Esq., Chief Department Counsel \nFOR APPLICANT \nChristopher Snowden, Esq. \nThe Department of Defense (DoD) declined to grant Applicant a security clearance. On \nMay 12, 2023, DoD issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the basis for that \ndecision \u2013 security concerns raised under Guideline J (Criminal Conduct) and Guideline E \n(Personal Conduct) of the National Security Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) of Security Executive \nAgent Directive 4 (effective June 8, 2017) (SEAD 4) and DoD Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as \namended) (Directive). On November 13, 2023, after conducting a hearing, Defense Office of \nHearings and Appeals (DOHA) Administrative Judge Darlene D. Lokey Anderson denied \nApplicant\u2019s security clearance eligibility. Applicant appealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and \nE3.1.30. For the reasons stated below, we remand the Judge\u2019s decision to a different Judge. \nUnder Guideline J, the SOR alleged that Applicant engaged in criminal activity to include \nconvictions for driving under the influence of alcohol (DUI) in 2007, 2009, and 2018 and \npossession of a controlled substance (marijuana) in 2005 and 2008. Under Guideline E, the \ncriminal conduct was cross-alleged, and Applicant was also alleged to have falsified his April 2023 \nresponse to DOHA interrogatories in which he stated he last consumed alcohol in June 2018. \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nIn responding to the SOR, Applicant admitted the criminal conduct allegations and denied \nthe falsification allegation. He did not answer the cross-alleged Guideline E allegation. Concluding \nthat Applicant failed to demonstrate a willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations, the \nJudge found against him on each of the SOR allegations. \nJudge\u2019s Findings of Fact and Analysis \nApplicant is 42 years old, unmarried, and has no children. He is employed by a defense \ncontractor since October 2022 and submitted a security clearance application in November 2022. \nApplicant\u2019s criminal conduct includes three DUI convictions and two convictions for possession \nof a controlled substance. Applicant started using marijuana at 15 years old, and in 2005 was \ncharged with possession of methamphetamine and marijuana. He claimed the methamphetamine \nwas not his, and he was convicted of the marijuana charge alone. He was placed in a diversion \nprogram and probation for five years. Decision at 2. In 2008, he was again charged with possession \nof marijuana, in violation of his probation. He was convicted and placed on probation for another \nfive years. Id. \nIn June 2007, Applicant was charged and convicted of DUI after consuming about a case \nof beer and a bottle of liquor. He was ordered to attend an 18-month alcohol program and placed \non probation for five years. The Judge noted that, following the arrest, Applicant tried to stop \ndrinking and was completely sober for about one year, then returned to heavy drinking. Id. \nIn October 2009, Applicant was charged and convicted of DUI, ordered to complete an 18\u00ad\nmonth alcohol program, and placed on house arrest and probation for five years. The Judge noted \nthat\u2014following the arrest\u2014Applicant again stopped drinking for about a year and a half, but then \nresumed: \nWhen he started consuming alcohol again, this time it was different. He would force \nhimself not to leave the house if he was drinking alcohol. He would only buy a six \nor twelve pack at a time if he went to the store. This pattern has continued to the \npresent. He reduced his alcohol consumption but continued to drink and at times to \nexcess. [Id. at 3.] \nIn June 2018, Applicant was charged and convicted with DUI, ordered to complete a DUI \nprogram, and sentenced to 10 days in jail and five years\u2019 probation, which he recently completed. \nApplicant explained that he was celebrating his birthday and consumed a six-pack of beer. Later \nthat evening, he drove to the store to purchase more beer and was pulled over by the police. The \nJudge found that \u201c[f]ollowing this arrest, he was able to remain sober for five or six months before \nreturning to consuming alcohol. Now, he only drinks socially.\u201d Id. \nIn response to DOHA interrogatories in April 2023, Applicant stated that he last consumed \nalcohol in June 2018. The Judge found that \u201c[t]his statement is not accurate since Applicant \nreturned to drinking some five or six months following the 2018 arrest for DUI. He deliberately \nfailed to disclose that he consumed alcohol approximately monthly and that he continues to \nconsume alcohol to the present.\u201d Id. She went on to say\u2013 \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant has not been formally diagnosed as an alcoholic, but he has seriously \ncontemplated the issue. This is the main reason he tries to abstain from drinking \nbecause he does not want it to control his life. He has not received inpatient or \noutpatient treatment for his alcohol problem but he has thought about it. He has not \nreceived therapy or counseling for his drinking problem. He has not attended an \nAlcoholics Anonymous (AA) meeting for about a year. [Id.] \nApplicant stated he is trying to improve himself and his lifestyle. Since 2018 he obtained \na high school diploma, graduated from an apprenticeship program at work, and enrolled in \ncommunity college. He also attended AA meetings and church men\u2019s groups. \nIn the Judge\u2019s analysis under Guideline J, she found that Applicant\u2019s five convictions and \na 2007 probation violation were sufficient to establish disqualifying conditions under Guideline J. \nThe Judge listed several mitigating conditions under Guideline J as potentially applicable, but \nfound that none were fully established. Id. at 5\u20136. She commended Applicant for completing the \ncourt-ordered requirements associated with each conviction, the progress he has made in obtaining \nan education to further improve his life, and for trying to change his past lifestyle patterns with \ninvolvement in church and \u201cfinding distractions unrelated to drinking.\u201d Id. at 6. However, she \nnoted that his \u201ccriminal history involving alcohol and drugs remains very concerning\u201d and that his \n\u201cmost recent conviction occurred in 2018 and his five-year probation has only recently been \nsatisfied.\u201d Id. The Judge continued: \n[Applicant] stated that he continues to consume alcohol even though following each \nof his three DUI convictions he tried to stop drinking. He was successful for a \nperiod of time, before he relapsed and started consuming alcohol again. Presently, \nhe still consumes alcohol and battles to maintain control of himself when he is \nunder the influence. In the future, with hard work and discipline, and possibly using \nresources available to him such as treatment programs, counseling, therapy, and \nothers, Applicant may be able to conquer this problem and remain alcohol free. \n[Id.] \nThe Judge concluded that, \u201cat this time, his long history of criminal conduct involving \ndrugs and alcohol does not show the requisite good judgment, reliability and trustworthiness \nnecessary to be eligible for access to classified information and it presents doubts concerning his \nability or willingness to abide by las, rules and regulations.\u201d Id. \nThe Judge found that Applicant\u2019s conduct established disqualifying conditions under \nGuideline E and that none of the mitigating conditions applied as \u201cApplicant does not meet the \nqualifications for access to classified information.\u201d Id. at 8. She concluded that Applicant\u2019s \ncriminal history of drug and alcohol abuse showed poor judgment, unreliability, and \ntrustworthiness. Additionally, the Judge concluded: \nApplicant was not accurate in response to his interrogatories that he last consumed \nalcohol in June 2018. This was not true. He testified that following his last DUI \narrest in 2018, he was able to abstain from alcohol for about five or six months \nbefore he started drinking again. He currently still consumes alcohol.

Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.32.3 \nand E3.1.33.3. \nIn deciding whether the Judge\u2019s rulings or conclusions are arbitrary and capricious, we will \nreview the Judge\u2019s decision to determine whether: it does not examine relevant evidence; it fails \nto articulate a satisfactory explanation for its conclusions, including a rational connection between \nthe facts found and the choice made; it does not consider relevant factors; it reflects a clear error \nof judgment; it fails to consider an important aspect of the case; it offers an explanation for the \ndecision that runs contrary to the record evidence; or it is so implausible that it cannot be ascribed \nto a mere difference of opinion. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 97-0435 at 3 (App. Bd. Jul. 14, 1998).  \nOn appeal, Applicant argues that the Judge improperly considered and analyzed this case \nunder the framework of Guideline G (Alcohol Consumption) disqualifying and mitigating \nconditions rather than under Guidelines E and J, which were alleged. In analyzing his case under \nGuideline G, Applicant argues, the Judge erred in two regards. First, she violated his due process \nrights under the Directive, as he was not provided notice of any Guideline G allegations and had \nno opportunity to respond. Second, she failed to consider his evidence in mitigation under \nGuidelines J and E as she was obligated to do. Additionally, Applicant argues that the Judge erred \nin finding that he falsified his response to interrogatories, as that conclusion runs contrary to record \nevidence. Applicant\u2019s three arguments have merit. \nOur review of the transcript confirms that both Department Counsel and the Judge focused \nprimarily on alcohol consumption issues throughout Applicant\u2019s hearing, although no Guideline \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nG concerns were alleged on the SOR. In his brief opening statement, Department Counsel stated \nthat there was \u201cconflicting evidence\u201d as to Applicant\u2019s alcohol use since his 2018 DUI, that there \nwas \u201ccurrently no evidence of aftercare or AA or anything like that,\u201d and that consequently \u201cit will \nnot be clearly consistent with national security interests for a favorable adjudication today.\u201d Tr. at \n10\u201311. On cross-examination, Department Counsel inquired at length into Applicant\u2019s recent \nalcohol habits, his participation in AA meetings, his attendance at other alcohol programs or \nclasses, and his answers to DOHA\u2019s interrogatories regarding alcohol consumption. Tr. 27\u201338. \nFollowing Department Counsel\u2019s cross-examination, the Judge asked a lengthy series of \nquestions related entirely to Applicant\u2019s alcohol use, consumption levels, periods of abstinence, \nalcohol treatment, therapy, counseling, and future intent with regard to alcohol use. Id. at 38-57. \nAt one juncture, the Judge asked Applicant, \u201c[D]id it ever come to you that you\u2019re an alcoholic? \nDid you ever come to that realization?\u201d Id. at 50. After another series of questions about \nApplicant\u2019s more recent alcohol consumption habits, the Judge proclaimed, \u201cI do enough of these \ncases to know people that have a condition with alcoholism, and you have a condition definitely.\u201d \nId. at 54. \nIn his closing argument, Department Counsel first acknowledged that Guideline G \nconcerns were not alleged, but then focused almost entirely on Applicant\u2019s failure to submit the \nprecise type of evidence necessary to mitigate under Guideline G: \nYour Honor, this isn\u2019t a Guideline G, but it certainly has discussion points of \nGuideline G with the alcohol use in this case. . . . Now the DUIs certainly could be \nmitigated over time except that one exacerbates the other, exacerbates the other. \nAnd, by the time you get to the 2018 DUI\u2014again, that\u2019s not that long ago\u2014but he \njust got off of probation. And the biggest concern is the lack of follow through, the \nlack of aftercare. As you pointed out, and the concern is, he may be an alcoholic. \nHe may not. I don\u2019t know because there\u2019s no evidence of any medical evaluation \nin the record and the burden is on the Applicant to show that. . . . He\u2019s been \npondering going to that alcohol support group at his Church . . .but he\u2019s not done \nit. He hasn\u2019t gone to AA for a year. There is no alcohol evaluation. There is nothing \nelse on the record, which it is his burden to provide, to show that he is following \naftercare. . . . And, even if we looked at the 2018 DUI as could that be mitigated by \ntime . . . it\u2019s not because of the lack of aftercare. . . . Given the background here, \ngiven the pattern of recidivism, given the pattern of not following through with \naftercare, and given the complete lack of evidence of support in place right now for \nhim on these issues of alcohol use, it is not clearly consistent with national security \ninterest for a favorable adjudication today.  [Tr. at 58-60 (emphasis added).] \nIn her decision, the Judge continues this focus on alcohol consumption issues, both in her \nfindings of fact and analysis. For example, the section that purports to be an analysis of whether \nApplicant has mitigated under Guideline J instead relies heavily on the factors one considers in a \nGuideline G case: \nFirst, Applicant is commended for completing the court-ordered requirements \nassociated with each of his convictions. He is also commended for the progress he \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nhas made in obtaining his education to further improve his life. It is also noted that \nhe is trying to change his past lifestyle patterns by getting involved in church and \nfinding other distractions unrelated to drinking. However, Applicant\u2019s criminal \nhistory involving alcohol and drugs remains very concerning. His most recent \nconviction occurred in 2018, and his five-year probation has only recently been \nsatisfied. He stated that he continues to consume alcohol even though following \neach of his three DUI convictions he tried to stop drinking. He was successful for \na period of time, before he relapsed and started consuming alcohol again. \nPresently, he still consumes alcohol and battles to maintain control of himself when \nhe is under the influence. In the future, with hard work and discipline, and possibly \nusing resources available to him such as treatment programs, counseling, therapy, \nand others, Applicant may be able to conquer this problem and remain alcohol free. \n[Decision at 6 (emphasis added).] \nDue Process \nWe turn first to Applicant\u2019s argument that the Judge \u201cdeprived [him] of his due process \nrights by adjudicating the case under Guideline G, rather than Guideline J and E.\u201d Appeal Brief \n(AB) at 2. Now represented by Counsel, Applicant argues: \n[Applicant], a pro se individual with a high school education, was notified that he \nwould need to present evidence relevant to the mitigating factors of Guideline J and \nE. [Applicant] was never put on notice that he would need to present any evidence \nrelated to alcoholism, abusing alcohol, alcohol use counseling, participating in \nalcohol treatment programs, demonstrating a pattern of abstinence or modified \nconsumption . . . and presenting evidence of overcoming the maladaptive use of \nalcohol. Yet, this is precisely the evidence that the Administrative Judge stated \n[Applicant] needed to present. In her words, \u201cIn the future, with hard work and \ndiscipline, and possibly using resources available to him such as treatment \nprograms, counseling, therapy, and others, Applicant may be able to conquer this \nproblem and remain alcohol free.\u201d The most obvious issue with this statement is \nwhen was the [Applicant] ever notified that he needed to present that evidence. . . . \nIf the Government was concerned about [Applicant\u2019s] alcohol use, it should have \nnotified [Applicant] under Guideline G which would put [him] on notice about the \nevidence that would be relevant, such as treatment programs, counseling, therapy, \netc. to \u201cconquer\u201d his alcohol problem and remain \u201calcohol free.\u201d [Applicant\u2019s] due \nprocess rights were denied because the decision to deny him access to classified \ninformation was based on a lack of evidence under Guideline G and [Applicant] \nwas never put on notice that Guideline G was at issue. [Id. at 17\u201318 (emphasis in \noriginal).] \nWe agree. Based on our review of the transcript and the Judge\u2019s decision, we conclude that \nthe focus on alcohol consumption violated Applicant\u2019s due process rights under the Directive. \nDirective \u00b6 4.3 requires that an unfavorable clearance decision shall not be made without first \nproviding the Applicant with notice of the specific reasons for the proposed action and an \nopportunity to respond to the reasons. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.3 further provides that an unfavorable \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nclearance decision shall not be made unless the applicant has been provided with a written SOR \nthat shall be as detailed and comprehensive as national security permits.  \nWe have previously stated that SORs are not to be judged by \"the strict standards of a \ncriminal indictment\u201d and that \u201c[a]s long as there is fair notice to the affected party and the affected \nparty has a reasonable opportunity to respond, a case should be adjudicated on the merits of \nrelevant issues and not concerned with pleading niceties.\u201d ISCR Case No. 99-0554 at 4\u20135 (App. \nBd. Jul. 24, 2000) (citations omitted). Moreover, it is well established that conduct not alleged in \nthe SOR may be considered for certain limited purposes, to include: assessing an applicant\u2019s \ncredibility; evaluating an applicant\u2019s evidence of extenuation, mitigation, or changed \ncircumstances; considering whether an applicant has demonstrated successful rehabilitation; or \nproviding evidence for whole-person analysis under Directive \u00b6 6.3. See ISCR Case No. 03-20327 \nat 4 (App. Bd. Oct 26, 2006). \nConsequently, although Guideline G security concerns were not alleged in the SOR, it was \nnot necessarily improper for the Judge to have inquired into and considered Applicant\u2019s alcohol \nconsumption habits, insofar as that conduct might be relevant on issues of rehabilitation, likelihood \nof recurrence of criminal conduct, and the whole-person analysis under Directive \u00b6 6.3. That said, \nnon-alleged conduct cannot be inquired into and considered in a manner that contravenes the notice \nrequirements in \u00b6\u00b6 4.3 and E3.1.3 of the Directive. While non-alleged conduct may be relevant in \nestablishing an SOR allegation, it may not become the basis for denying or revoking a security \nclearance. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 12-11375 at 6 (App Bd. Jun. 17, 2016). We recognize that this \nmay appear\u2014in the context of a particular case\u2014 to be a fine line. However, our review of this \nrecord persuades us that the Judge in this case crossed that fine line and \u201cdid not consider this \nevidence in its proper context.\u201d USAF-C Case No. 23-00001-R at 6 (App. Bd. May 31, 2023). \nReading the transcript and decision, we conclude that the focus on Applicant\u2019s alcohol \nconsumption habits and closely related topics (e.g., aftercare, AA, therapy, abstinence, and relapse) \nwent beyond the limited purposes for which non-alleged conduct may be used. Both in her inquiry \nat hearing and in her decision, the Judge addressed issues that are explicitly listed as mitigating \nfactors under AG \u00b6 23 of Guideline G: what steps has Applicant taken to overcome his alcohol \nproblem?; has he demonstrated a pattern of modified consumption or abstinence?; is he \nparticipating in counseling or treatment?; does he have a history of treatment and relapse? We \nconclude that the weight of the decision was based upon non-alleged issues and that Applicant\u2019s \ndue process rights under the Directive were violated. Id. In the absence of an amendment to the \nSOR, an Administrative Judge cannot find against an applicant based on a matter not encompassed \nby the SOR. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 05-05334 at 4 (App. Bd. Jan. 10, 2007). Under the facts of \nthis case, we conclude the Judge\u2019s error is harmful.  \nFailure to Consider Mitigation under Guidelines J and E \nAs a corollary to his due process argument, Applicant asserts that\u2014because the Judge \nerroneously focused on Guideline G mitigating factors\u2014she failed to properly apply Guideline J \nand E mitigating conditions as required by the Directive. Specifically, he contends that the Judge \ndid not appropriately consider his education level, accomplishments, life changes, employment, \nclean criminal record since 2018, and change of criminal associates in light of the applicable \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nmitigating conditions. Again, Applicant\u2019s argument has merit. The Judge\u2019s analysis fails to \nadequately address the relevant mitigating conditions, particularly the application of mitigating \nconditions AG \u00b6\u00b6 32(a) and (d).1 \nIn her analysis, the Judge emphasized factors that are not directly relevant to whether \nApplicant\u2019s criminal conduct has been mitigated (e.g., Applicant\u2019s continued alcohol \nconsumption, periods of abstinence, and purported relapse), and she gave short shrift to evidence \nthat is directly relevant under Guideline J\u2019s mitigating conditions. For example, the Judge failed \nto consider the five years since Applicant\u2019s last DUI as mitigation under AG \u00b6 32(a), but instead \nimplied that his recent successful completion of his five-year probation period is indicative of \ninsufficient time elapsed since his last conviction. Under AG \u00b6 32(d), the Judge should have \nanalyzed the passage of time since the last occurrence of criminal activity, completion of probation, \neducation, employment, community involvement, attendance at AA, and other factors in \nmitigation. She failed to do so. Additionally, her conclusion that \u201che still consumes alcohol and \nbattles to maintain control of himself\u201d and that \u201cwith hard work and discipline, and possibly using \nresources available to him such as treatment programs, counseling, therapy, and others, Applicant \nmay be able to conquer this problem and remain alcohol free,\u201d is misplaced and not adequately \nsupported by the evidence. \nGuidelines J and E do not require an Applicant to receive alcohol counseling or treatment, \nabstain, or modify alcohol consumption in order to qualify for a security clearance. The Judge\u2019s \nanalysis appears to impose such a requirement without an adequate explanation of how Applicant\u2019s \nalcohol consumption may be relevant to the mitigating conditions established under Guideline J. \nSaid differently, in focusing on Applicant\u2019s non-alleged alcohol consumption, the Judge failed to \nexplain why those facts outweighed Applicant\u2019s significant mitigating evidence: the passage of \ntime since the last criminal activity, his successful completion of a lengthy probation period, his \neducational achievements, and the completion of an apprenticeship program. In sum, we agree that \nthe Judge erred in that her decision fails to properly apply the evidence in mitigation to the \nappropriate mitigating conditions, and we conclude that the error was harmful. \nFalsification \nWe turn finally to Applicant\u2019s argument that the Judge erred in finding that, in April 2023, \nhe falsified his response to DOHA interrogatories regarding his alcohol consumption habits. In his \nanswers to the Government\u2019s interrogatory questions, Applicant stated that he last consumed \nalcohol in June 2018. The Judge found that Applicant failed to disclose that he has consumed \nalcohol approximately monthly until at least December 2022, as he stated in his PSI, which he \nadopted in his response to DOHA\u2019s interrogatories. The relevant portion of the interrogatory reads \nas follows: \n1 AG \u00b6 32: (a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it happened under such unusual \ncircumstances, that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or \ngood judgment. AG \u00b6 32: (d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including, but not limited to, the passage \nof time without recurrence of criminal activity, restitution, compliance with the terms of parole or probation, job \ntraining or higher education, good employment record, or constructive community involvement. \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n       \n \n  \n \n \n       \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nC.

Applicant contends that the Judge improperly concluded that he deliberately \nfalsified a material fact in his interrogatory answer as her factual findings are \u201cwholly unsupported \nby the record.\u201d AB at 7. \nApplicant points out that the Judge found that he \u201cdeliberately failed to disclose that he \nconsumed alcohol approximately monthly and that he continues to consume alcohol,\u201d relying \nexclusively on an inaccurate answer he gave in response in the interrogatory question asking when \nhe last consumed alcohol, without considering other evidence that he provided at the same time. \nIn his response to interrogatories, Applicant answered: \u201cJune 2018,\u201d and described drinking about \nsix beers during his birthday celebration.

He adopted his \nDecember 2022 PSI as accurate. In the PSI, he confirmed that he continued to drink, consuming \nabout one to two beers monthly, but said that he reduced his alcohol use and no longer drives after \ndrinking. He also described the June 2018 incident as a birthday celebration where he consumed \nabout six beers before driving. GE 2 at 5. Applicant\u2019s statement in the adopted PSI and his answer \nto interrogatory question C.1.(a)(1) are contradictory. At hearing, Applicant clarified that he was \nconfused and mistakenly answered the interrogatory question with the date of his last DUI incident, \nnot the date of his last drink. Applicant\u2019s full response to question C.1.a.(1) supports this \ncontention. \nThe Directive provides that \u201cthe adjudicative process is predicated upon individuals \nproviding relevant information pertaining to their background and character for use in \ninvestigating and adjudicating their national security eligibility. Any incident of intentional \nmaterial falsification or purposeful non-cooperation with security processing is of significant \nconcern. Such conduct raises questions about an individual's judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness and may be predictive of their willingness or ability to protect the national \nsecurity.\u201d AG \u00b6 2(i). \nApplicant argues both that his adoption of the PSI and incorrect answer to the written \ninterrogatory question created, at worst, contradictory information about his alcohol consumption, \nnot a deliberate falsification and that the mistaken interrogatory answer was immaterial to the \nGovernment\u2019s concerns regarding his criminal conduct. In concluding that Applicant deliberately \nfalsified his interrogatory answer, the Judge failed to adequately examine and resolve the \ncontradictions, failed to explain why Applicant\u2019 concurrent adoption of his PSI did not resolve the \nissue, and failed to explain its materiality. The record fails to support a finding of intentional \nfalsification of a material fact, and the Judge\u2019s analysis of SOR \u00b6 2.b is unsustainable. \nConclusion \nThe errors identified above warrant a remand. Based on our review of the record, we find \nthat the nature of the Judge\u2019s questions at hearing, the focus of her decision on non-alleged \nconduct, and her adverse credibility determination would cause a reasonable person to question \nthe impartiality of the Judge on remand. See USAF-C Case No. 23-00001-R at 7. Given these \ncircumstances, we conclude that the best resolution is to remand this case to a different judge. \nUnder Directive E3.1.35, the Judge assigned the case is required to issue a new clearance decision. \nThe Board retains no jurisdiction over a remanded decision. However, the Judge\u2019s decision issued \nafter remand may be appealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30. \n10 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \nOrder \nThe decision is REMANDED. \nSigned: Moira Modzelewski \nMoira Modzelewski \nAdministrative Judge \nChair, Appeal Board \nSigned: Gregg A. Cervi \nGregg A. Cervi \nAdministrative Judge \nMember, Appeal Board \nSeparate Opinion of Board Member James B. Norman \nWhile I concur with the majority that a remand to another Judge is necessary, I respectfully \ndisagree with the conclusion that the Judge\u2019s focus on Applicant\u2019s alcohol use constituted a \ndeprivation of due process that crossed the \u201cfine line\u201d between permissible and impermissible \nconsideration of unalleged conduct. \nAlthough the Judge\u2019s questions and her discussion of Applicant\u2019s alcohol consumption \nbore a resemblance to issues under Guideline G, this does not equate to having failed to put \nApplicant on notice of the relevance of his alcohol consumption as it relates to his past criminal \nconduct, nor did it require amendment of the SOR. An SOR must provide Applicants with \n\u201cdetailed and comprehensive\u201d notice of DOHA's basis for the proposed denial of a clearance, \nwhich the SOR clearly did under Guideline J. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.3. An applicant\u2019s behavior may \nhave security significance under more than one Guideline and either the Judge or Department \nCounsel could have amended the SOR to allege a Guideline G allegation. See ISCR Case No. 06\u00ad\n21537 at 5 (App. Bd. Feb. 21, 2008); Directive \u00b6 E3.1.17. However, amendment is not mandatory \nwhen that same information has independent relevance and significance under another guideline. \n\u201cThe fact that Government did not allege that conduct under all possible applicable guidelines did \nnot relieve Applicant of the responsibility of mitigating the conduct within the scope of the \nguideline alleged.\u201d ISCR Case No. 15-02326 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 14, 2016). \nAs discussed in the majority decision, unalleged conduct can be considered for a number \nof reasons. As applied to the Guideline J mitigating conditions in a case in which an applicant's \ncriminal conduct was alcohol-related, consideration of past and current alcohol consumption is \n11 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nrelevant to the judge\u2019s assessment of rehabilitation and the likelihood of recurrence. In this case, \nthe Guideline J allegations provided Applicant with sufficient notice of the conduct under \nconsideration, which on its face raised obvious issues related to his drug and alcohol use. Taken \nas a whole, the SOR satisfied the requirements of the Directive. See ISCR Case No. 06-19544 at \n4 (App. Bd. May 28, 2008). Therefore, it is reasonable to expect that Applicant should have \nanticipated that his drug and alcohol use were elements of the criminal conduct to be addressed at \nhis hearing.2 Although pro se applicants cannot be expected to act like lawyers, they must take \ntimely, reasonable steps to protect their rights under Executive Order 10865 and the Directive. \nISCR Case No. 00-0593 at 4 (App. Bd. May 14, 2001). If applicants fail to take such steps, their \nfailure to do so does not constitute a denial of their rights. ISCR Case No. 02-19896 at 4 (App. Bd. \nDec. 29, 2003). \nAlthough addressing Applicant\u2019s alcohol habits is a relevant and appropriate part of \nassessing the Guideline J allegations, the Judge made factual assumptions and conclusions \u2013 such \nas diagnosing Applicant as an alcoholic who must abstain from drinking \u2013 that are wholly \nunsupported by the record evidence and which permeated the decision. This unreasonably tainted \nher assessment of the mitigating evidence and constitutes harmful error. When coupled with the \njudgmental manner in which the Judge proceeded to address Applicant\u2019s use of alcohol, as \ndescribed in the majority decision, this raises the issue of whether the Judge still retains the \nsubstance and the appearance of fairness and impartiality. ISCR Case No. 09-02839 at 4 (App. Bd. \nOct. 29, 2010). Accordingly, I concur with the majority\u2019s ultimate disposition of this case. \nSigned: James B. Norman \nJames B.

The evaluator concluded there was a reasonable concern that Applicant\u2019s \npsychological conditions impaired their judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. \nApplicant disagreed with the psychologist\u2019s findings from the September 2022 evaluation. \nIn November 2022, they started seeing a new therapist and, under the supervision of their \nadversely to Applicant.

Applicant continues to participate in weekly therapy sessions to the current time and is \nfully compliant with their treatment plan. \nThe Judge\u2019s Analysis: The Judge\u2019s analysis is summarized and quoted below. \nThe facts of this case establish disqualifying conditions under AG \u00b6\u00b6 28(a)\u2013(c).3 Although \nApplicant has not consistently taken medications as prescribed due to side effects, AG \u00b6 28(d)4 is \nnot fully established as Applicant\u2019s treating psychiatrist has taken Applicant off all medications \nsince January 2023, with positive results. \nAll mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 29 were considered.5 \n3 AG \u00b6 28: (a) behavior that casts doubt on an individual\u2019s judgment, stability, reliability, or trustworthiness, not \ncovered under any other guideline and that may indicate an emotional, mental, or personality condition, including, but \nnot limited to, irresponsible, violent, self-harm, suicidal, paranoid, manipulative, impulsive, chronic lying, deceitful, \nexploitative, or bizarre behaviors; (b) an opinion by a duly qualified mental health professional that the individual has \na condition that may impair judgment, stability, reliability, or trustworthiness; and (c) voluntary or involuntary inpatient \ntreatment. \n4 AG \u00b6 28(d): failure to follow a prescribed treatment plan . . . including, but not limited to, failure to take prescribed \nmedication or failure to attend required counseling sessions. \n5 AG \u00b6 29: (a) the identified condition is readily controllable with treatment, and the individual has demonstrated \nongoing and consistent compliance with the treatment plan; (b) the individual has voluntarily entered a counseling or \ntreatment program for a condition that is amenable to treatment, and the individual is currently receiving counseling \nor treatment with a favorable prognosis by a duly qualified mental health professional; (c) recent opinion by a duly \nqualified mental health professional employed by, or acceptable to and approved by, the U.S. Government that an \nindividual\u2019s previous condition is under control or in remission, and has a low probability of recurrence or \nexacerbation; (d) the past psychological/psychiatric condition was temporary, the situation has been resolved, and the \nindividual no longer has indications of emotional instability; and (e) there is no indication of a current problem. \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe Judge summarized the case in mitigation as follows: \nApplicant had a difficult childhood. As a 12-year-old, Applicant was \nevaluated and referred for inpatient treatment. It is clear from their testimony and \nmedical records that they predominantly suffered from depressive symptoms \nthroughout their high school and young adult years. \nIn November 2022, Applicant started treatment with a new mental health \nprofessional and currently continues treatment on a weekly basis. In conjunction \nwith their psychiatrist, physician assistant, and therapist, Applicant was slowly \nweaned from all medications. The plan was to put them on medication when their \nsymptoms required it, but since January 2023, Applicant has remained medication-\nfree. The current treatment records reflect that Applicant has improved, and their \ncurrent diagnosis is autism spectrum disorder, and major depressive disorder, in full \nremission. Applicant is currently participating in treatment, and they are compliant \nwith their treatment plan. The current medical and mental health staff have provided \na favorable prognosis as recently as February 2024. Applicant successfully \nmitigated the psychological conditions security concerns. [Id. at 8.] \nDiscussion \nOn appeal, the Government contends that the Judge\u2019s mitigation analysis was arbitrary or \ncapricious in that it \u201cfailed to specify which MCs applied; used piecemeal analysis of selected \nportions of the record evidence by focusing exclusively and uncritically on AE C [Applicant\u2019s \npost-hearing submission of letters from providers]; ignored significant aspects of the case \nincluding Applicant\u2019s long, complex, and cyclical medical history; and drew conclusions that are \nunsupported by the totality of the record evidence and that are at odds with Appeal Board \nprecedent.\u201d Appeal Brief (AB) at 21. For the reasons detailed below, we are not persuaded by the \nGovernment\u2019s arguments. \nThe Appeal Board may reverse or remand the judge\u2019s decision to grant deny or revoke a \nsecurity clearance if it is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.

Jun. 25, 2019).  \nThe Government fairly highlights that the Judge\u2019s mitigation analysis was brief, consisting \nof only two paragraphs, and that she neglected to identify which mitigating condition she found \napplicable. AB at 18. The Government\u2019s position is that none of the mitigating conditions found \nin MC \u00b6 29 fully apply and that the Judge erred in concluding otherwise. Specifically, the \nGovernment contends: that Applicant\u2019s condition is not readily controllable with treatment, as \nrequired by MC \u00b6 29(a); that the record does not contain a favorable prognosis, as required by MC \n\u00b6 29(b); and that there is no evidence that Applicant\u2019s previous psychological condition has a low \nprobability of recurrence or exacerbation, as required by MC \u00b6 29(c); and that the record does not \nsupport application of either MC \u00b6\u00b6 29 (d) or (e) as there is no evidence that Applicant\u2019s condition \nwas temporary or that there is no current problem. Although the Judge did not cite explicitly to the \nmitigating conditions she found applicable, the decision implicitly cites to MC \u00b6\u00b6 29(a) and (b), as \nthe Judge highlights Applicant\u2019s ongoing compliance with their treatment plan, the fact that \nApplicant is in remission, and the fact that they have a favorable prognosis. \nWe are unpersuaded by the Government\u2019s arguments regarding the Judge\u2019s application of \nthese mitigating conditions, as the Government appears largely to argue for a different \ninterpretation of the evidence. For example, turning to the Government\u2019s argument that \nApplicant\u2019s condition is not readily controllable with treatment, the Government details at \nconsiderable length Applicant\u2019s psychiatric history, which began at age 11 or 12, and the various \nmedical and therapeutic treatments that were tried, often to little avail, through Applicant\u2019s middle \nschool, high school, and early college years. The Government argues that the decision\u2019s \n\u201cextremely brief mitigation analysis ignored or disregarded this significant aspect of the case\u201d and \ninstead focused on statements provided by her current psychiatric team. AB at 23. The \nGovernment\u2019s argument on this specific issue neatly captures a thread that runs throughout its \nappeal brief. The Government views Applicant\u2019s medical history as \u201clong, complex, and cyclical.\u201d \nId. at 21 (emphasis added). The Judge\u2019s decision reflects instead a linear view of this case, with \nApplicant emerging from a difficult childhood and the turbulence of adolescence into adulthood, \nwith a significant improvement in her mental health as she consistently seeks and heeds psychiatric \ntreatment. \nA party\u2019s \u201cdisagreement with the Judge\u2019s weighing of the evidence, or an ability to argue \nfor a different interpretation of the evidence, is not sufficient to demonstrate that the Judge weighed \nthe evidence or reached conclusions in a manner that is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.\u201d \nISCR Case No. 06-17409 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct. 12, 2007). Moreover, there is a rebuttable \npresumption that the Judge considered all the record evidence unless the Judge specifically states \notherwise, and the appealing party has a heavy burden when trying to rebut that presumption. \nAdministrative judges' decisions are not measured against a standard of perfection and \nthere is no requirement that a judge discuss every aspect of the evidence in her decision or to \nexpressly cite or explicitly quote every provision of the Directive that is applicable in a case. \nInstead, the long-standing requirement is that the judge\u2019s decision must be written in a manner that \nallows the parties and the Board to discern what findings the judge is making and what conclusions \nhe or she is reaching.

Now an adult in control of her own mental health treatment, \nApplicant has been under consistent psychiatric treatment since August 2019 and has been with \nthe same practice since April 2021. In light of Applicant\u2019s various diagnoses over her teen years, \nher current psychiatrist requested at the onset of treatment that Applicant submit to \nneuropsychiatric testing. That testing indicated diagnoses of autism spectrum disorder and major \ndepressive disorder, and Applicant\u2019s psychiatric team ultimately adopted those diagnoses, \neliminating the diagnosis of bipolar II. In its letter of February 2024, the psychiatric practice noted \nthat the current diagnosis is \u201cmajor depressive disorder, in full remission.\u201d AE C at 1. \nThe Government challenges the Judge\u2019s uncritical adoption of this diagnosis, noting that \nApplicant did not submit full medical records that would provide greater detail about the change \nin diagnosis but instead submitted letters from her psychiatric and therapist team, with relatively \nfew treatment records. However, although the Government may have desired more medical \nrecords, the Judge was well within her authority to find the summary from Applicant\u2019s current \npsychiatric team sufficient and to give significant weight to the diagnosis, as the team has been \ntreating Applicant for three years. Moreover, the record supports the Judge\u2019s conclusion that \nApplicant \u201cpredominantly suffered from depressive symptoms throughout their high school and \nyoung adult years.\u201d Decision at 8. Indeed, the medical records indicate that bipolar disorder was \naffirmatively ruled out by some previous providers and that Applicant\u2019s current psychotherapist \nconcurs in the psychiatrist\u2019s assessment that Applicant does not have bipolar II disorder but rather \nmajor depressive disorder in remission. AE C at 2, 9. With regard to the change in diagnosis, the \nBoard notes that Applicant\u2019s current diagnosis of major depressive disorder is not one that raises \na per se security concern. 6 With regard to the conclusion that Applicant is in \u201cfull remission,\u201d the \nJudge was again well within her authority to rely on the medical opinion of the psychiatric team \nthat has been treating Applicant for three years. \nThe Government also challenges the Judge\u2019s determination that there is a \u201cfavorable \nprognosis,\u201d as required by MC \u00b6 29(b), citing to the Board\u2019s decision in USN-M Case No. 23\u00ad\n00060-R (App. Bd. Jun. 9, 2023). In that case, Applicant argued that the Judge erred in failing to \nconsider a diagnosis of \u201cPTSD and major depressive disorder in remission\u201d as a favorable \nprognosis for the application of MC \u00b6 29(b), and the Board held that \u201cApplicant has not established \nthat the Judge erred in concluding that her medical records do not reflect a favorable prognosis.\u201d \nId. at 5. That case is easily distinguishable from the case at hand, and we decline to apply this \nparticular holding as broadly as the Government would like. Said differently, in the context of this \ncase, we decline to find that the Judge erred in discerning a favorable prognosis from the letters \nand records submitted by Applicant\u2019s treating psychiatric team and psychotherapist, as her \n6 In November 2016, the Director of National Intelligence (DNI) issued a memorandum revising the mental health \nquestions in Section 21 of Standard Form 86, the security clearance application (SCA).

Given the evidence that Applicant has been medication-free for over a year \nwith no full depressive episodes, that they are fully compliant with treatment, and that the major \ndepressive disorder is in remission, the Judge could reasonably conclude that Applicant\u2019s condition \nwas mitigated under MC \u00b6 29(a) or MC \u00b6 29(b).

While the \nmajority correctly states that the arbitrary and capricious review standard is highly deferential and \nwe may not substitute our judgment for that of the Judge, it also correctly notes that, in deciding \nwhether the Judge\u2019s rulings or conclusions are arbitrary and capricious, we will review the decision \nto determine whether: it does not examine relevant evidence; it fails to articulate a satisfactory \nexplanation for its conclusions, including a rational connection between the facts found and the \nchoice made; it does not consider relevant factors; it reflects a clear error of judgment; it fails to \nconsider an important aspect of the case; it offers an explanation for the decision that runs contrary \nto the record evidence; or it is so implausible that it cannot be ascribed to a mere difference of \nopinion. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 97-0184 at 5, n.3 (App. Bd. Jun. 16, 1998). In this instance, the \nJudge failed to consider an important aspect of the case and articulate a satisfactory explanation \nfor her conclusion that Applicant\u2019s long-term mental health conditions which could impair their \njudgment, reliability, and trustworthiness are mitigated. Specifically, while apparently relying \nheavily on the conclusion in Exhibit C that Applicant\u2019s symptoms were in remission, she did not \naddress the scope, significance, and relevance of remission and Applicant\u2019s prognosis for long\u00ad\nterm mental health stability in the context of their past medical history. \nAt the outset, the Judge did not identify the specific Mitigating Conditions that she applied, \ninstead simply noting that she considered five Mitigating Conditions under \u00b6 29. Her relatively \nbrief analysis leaves us guessing which Mitigating Conditions she concluded either fully or \npartially applied and the rationale for making those determinations. This was error. ISCR Case No. \n20-00618 at 5 (App. Bd. Jan. 18, 2023). As we have previously stated, the Judge's decision must \nbe written in a manner that allows the parties and the Board to discern what findings the Judge is \nmaking and what conclusions he or she is reaching. Id. While one could attempt to extrapolate \nfrom the Judge\u2019s narrative which Mitigating Conditions were being applied, neither the parties nor \nthe Board should be left to speculate; particularly in a case with complex medical issues such as \nthis. \nThis lack of specificity directly impacts the Judge\u2019s substantive mitigation analysis. To the \nextent that one can correlate her mitigation discussion with the specific Mitigating Conditions, the \nJudge appears to have focused on Mitigating Conditions 29(a), (b) and (c). MC 29(a) requires that \n\u201cthe identified condition is readily controllable with treatment, and the individual has \ndemonstrated ongoing and consistent compliance with the treatment plan.\u201d MC 29(b) provides \nmitigation if \u201cthe individual has voluntarily entered a counseling or treatment program for a \ncondition that is amenable to treatment, and the individual is currently receiving counseling or \ntreatment with a favorable prognosis by a duly qualified mental health professional.\u201d MC 29(c) \nrequires a \u201crecent opinion by a duly qualified mental health professional employed by, or \nacceptable to and approved by, the U.S. Government that an individual's previous condition is \nunder control or in remission, and has a low probability of recurrence or exacerbation. \n(Emphasis added to each) \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \nCommon to each of these Mitigating Conditions is that an applicant\u2019s mental health must \nbe stable to the point that it no longer impacts judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. Although \nremission can be mitigating, it cannot stand alone in a vacuum. It must be evaluated in the context \nof the scope of what it medically encompasses and the long-term prognosis for continued \nremission. The significance of what is encompassed by Applicant\u2019s remission and their prognosis \nis critical to this case because security clearance decisions are not an exact science, but rather are \npredictive judgments. Department of Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528-29 (1988). At the same \ntime, clearance eligibility is open-ended. Therefore, the eligibility analysis must encompass more \nthan a snapshot of an applicant\u2019s current mental health, particularly when the disqualifying \nconcerns are complex and span a lengthy period of time. The Government cannot grant a clearance \nwithout significant medical evidence that an applicant\u2019s mental health will continue to be stable. \nApplicant\u2019s current period of remission and the prognosis for continued remission must be \nspecifically assessed in the context of their lengthy and complicated mental health history that \nincludes periodic bouts of severe anxiety and depression, suicidal ideations, hospitalizations, and \nmultiple diagnoses by multiple mental health professionals.7 Doing so requires a foundational \nmedical opinion that elaborates beyond simply concluding that a condition is in remission. There \nmust be evidence of what remission means relative to Applicant. Therefore, the burden is on \nApplicant to show that a mental health provider has concluded to a medical certainty that a \nsufficient time period has passed such that Applicant can be considered in long-term remission \nand that relapse is not likely to occur.8 The more serious or long-term an applicant's disqualifying \ncircumstances are, the stronger the evidence of rehabilitation needs to be for the Judge to find that \nan applicant has overcome the negative security implications. ISCR Case No. 08-03726 at 4 (Oct. \n2, 2009). In a case involving long-term mental illness, an applicant has a very heavy burden to \nshow that not only is the illness amenable to treatment and is in remission, but that there is a long\u00ad\nterm prognosis to a medical certainty that it will remain in remission. \nWhile medical evidence provides a factual foundation for analysis, it is the Judge\u2019s \nresponsibility to weigh the significance of the medical professionals\u2019 expert opinions. It is not \nreasonable or possible for a Judge to make independent conclusions or assumptions about medical \nmatters such as remission and prognosis.9 As the majority has opined, the weight to be given to \n7 Although, as the majority correctly notes, major depressive disorder is not per se a security concern it is, nonetheless, \ndisqualifying if it adversely impacts an applicant\u2019s judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. Applicant\u2019s mental \nhealth history reflects significant disqualifying concerns in addition to depression and the Administrative Judge found \nthat \u201cAG \u00b6\u00b6 28(a)-(c) have been established by the facts of this case.\u201d Decision at 6. \n8 The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Medical Disorders - 5 (DSM-5) defines full remission of Major Depressive \nDisorder II as \u201cDuring the past 2 months, no significant signs or symptoms of the disturbance were present.\u201d DSM-5 \nat 188. However, although there is no bright line rule for determining the point at which the passage of time becomes \nmitigating, this threshold clearly is not outcome-determinative in the context of a clearance decision which must \npredict much further into the future. \n9 Assessing remission differs from situations in which the passage of time reflects reform that can be assessed by a \nlay person. C.f. ISCR Case No. 03-18522 at 2 (App. Bd. May 16, 2005) (Not arbitrary or capricious for the judge to \nconclude a period of drug use cessation is mitigating.) It is more analogous to situations involving matters that are \nbeyond the authority and expertise of DOHA administrative judges such as making factual pronouncements about the \nrelationship between the United States and foreign countries.

It was incumbent upon the \nAdministrative Judge to have elaborated upon this aspect of the case based upon the record medical \nevidence. This differs from the majority\u2019s opinion that the Government\u2019s arguments amount to \nalternative weighing of the evidence because this is critical evidence that appears not have been \nweighed. \nA judge\u2019s findings of fact must be based on the record evidence as a whole, including any \nevidence that runs contrary to those findings. Furthermore, if a judge does not discuss or even \nmention a significant aspect of the case that reasonably could be expected to be explicitly taken \ninto account in the decision, then a serious question arises as to whether the judge forgot that \naspect, ignored it, failed to take it into account, dismissed that aspect of the case for no apparent \nreason, failed to understand the significance of that aspect of the case, or engaged in an arbitrary \nand capricious analysis. ISCR Case No. 02-02195 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 9, 2004). In this case, the \nJudge\u2019s failure to adequately address remission or prognosis leaves her analysis incomplete and \nconstitutes error. \nIn light of the errors identified, above, the best resolution of this case is to remand it to the \nJudge to correct those errors and for further processing consistent with the Directive. \nSigned: James B.

On December 13, 2023, Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) \nAdministrative Judge Darlene D. Lokey Anderson denied Applicant\u2019s security clearance \neligibility. Applicant appealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30. \nThe SOR alleged that Applicant used hallucinogenic mushrooms once in March 2020 while \nhe was granted access to classified information or was holding a sensitive position. The SOR \nfurther alleged that Applicant used marijuana from July 2015 to May 2017.

He was granted \na secret security clearance in November 2018 and, during the preceding investigation, disclosed \nthat he used marijuana while in college from July 2015 to May 2017. In November 2022, Applicant \nsubmitted a new application in support of a request to upgrade his security clearance, wherein he \ndisclosed that he used hallucinogenic mushrooms one time in March 2020. At the time of said use, \nhe was granted security clearance eligibility and held a sensitive position. \nFinding that \u201cApplicant knowingly used hallucinogenic mushrooms, an illegal substance, \nin March 2020, while granted access to classified information or while holding a sensitive \nposition,\u201d the Judge applied disqualifying conditions AG \u00b6\u00b6 25(a), 25(c), and 25(f).1 Decision at \n5. The Judge identified mitigating conditions AG \u00b6\u00b6 26(a) and 26(b) for the record, presumably to \nnote their potential relevance, but ultimately held that neither applied, and she concluded that \n\u201cApplicant has not demonstrated the level of maturity, integrity, good judgment, and reliability \nnecessary to access classified information.\u201d Decision at 6. \nFailure to Apply AG \u00b6 26(a) \nOn appeal, Applicant contends that the Judge erred by failing to apply AG \u00b6 26(a), arguing \nthat his illegal drug use \u201chappened roughly 4 years ago . . . , exactly once, and happened under \nsuch anomalous circumstances that it has never occurred again.\u201d Appeal Brief at 1. Applicant\u2019s \nargument in this regard warrants review. \nAG \u00b6 26(a) affords mitigation where \u201cthe behavior happened so long ago, was so \ninfrequent, or happened under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.\u201d The Directive is silent \non what constitutes a sufficient period of reform and rehabilitation. That silence, however, does \nnot relieve a judge of the obligation to construe and apply pertinent provisions of the Directive in \na reasonable, common-sense way. See ISCR Case No. 02-08032, 2004 WL 1434394 at *5 (App. \nBd. May 14, 2004). The Board has repeatedly held that, if the record reflects a significant period \nof time has passed without misconduct by an applicant, then the judge must articulate a rational \nbasis for concluding why that time does not demonstrate changed circumstances or conduct \nsufficient to warrant a finding of reform or rehabilitation. Id. \nHere, Applicant\u2019s single hallucinogenic mushroom use occurred in mid-2020, more than \ntwo years before he submitted his latest security clearance application and over three years prior \nto the close of the record in this matter. Despite the foregoing, the Judge concluded that AG \u00b6 26(a) \nwas not applicable but provided problematic analysis as to the frequency of use and no analysis as \nto the passage of time. With respect to the former, the Judge opined that, \u201cWhether Applicant used \nthe hallucinogenic mushrooms ten times or one time, while granted a security clearance, the \n1 AG \u00b6 25(a) \u2013 any substance misuse; AG \u00b6 25(c) \u2013 illegal possession of a controlled substance, including cultivation, \nprocessing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of drug paraphernalia; AG \u00b6 25(f) \u2013 any illegal \ndrug use while granted access to classified information or holding a sensitive position. \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nnumber of times he used it is not as relevant to the issue as is the fact that he violated security \nprocedures in the first place.\u201d Decision at 5-6.

Dec. 20, 2006). \nAdjudicative Desk Reference \nIn his brief, Applicant incorrectly cites to Adjudicative Desk Reference (ADR) provisions \nin support of his arguments. Appeal Brief at 2.

Under Guideline E, the information under Guideline H was cross-alleged, and \nApplicant is alleged to have falsified his 2017 Electronic Questionnaires for Investigations \nProcessing (e-QIP) by not disclosing his use of LSD, mushrooms, and marijuana. In responding to \nthe SOR, Applicant admitted each allegation with explanations. The Judge found against him on \nall of the allegations. \nIn summary of the decision, the Judge found that Applicant, in his late 20s and currently a \ntest engineer for a government contractor, previously submitted an electronic Questionnaire for \nNon-Sensitive Positions (e-QIP) (SF 85 format) in 2017 wherein he answered \u201cno\u201d to questions \nregarding his use or possession of illegal drugs, failing to disclose use of illegal drugs including \nLSD, mushrooms, and marijuana that he admitted to in a subsequent security clearance application \n(SCA) he completed in 2022. In the 2022 SCA, Applicant admitted to using hallucinogenic \nsubstances (LSD and mushrooms) about twice per year while in college and about once a year \nuntil 2021. He also admitted to using Adderall as a study aid in college a few times a year, to using \nmarijuana from 2012 to 2016, and to purchasing marijuana from legal dispensaries from 2016 to \n2021. Decision at 2. In Applicant\u2019s answer to the SOR, he stated that his previous drug use was \ninfrequent, that he was not dependent on drugs, and that they had no negative effect on his work \nor personal life. He stopped using illegal drugs in September 2021 when he was offered a position \nrequiring a security clearance, has not used Adderall for seven years, and did not disclose his prior \ndrug use on his 2017 e-QIP because he was young, fresh out of school, and afraid that he would \nbe fired if he disclosed it. He declared that he will not use illegal drugs in the future and that his \nfalsification was wrong. Id. at 2-3. \nThe Judge held that the evidence falls short of demonstrating rehabilitation as Applicant \ncontinued using drugs until about two years ago, including after completing his 2017 e-QIP, and \nhe was motivated by his search for a new job, not a change of attitude about drug involvement. \nAlthough he has acknowledged his illegal drug use and abstained since 2021, Applicant provided \nno evidence that he has disassociated from his drug-using associates or changed his environment, \nnor did he express acknowledgement that any future involvement would be grounds for revocation \nof national security eligibility. Finally, the Judge held that Applicant worked a long time under \nfalse pretenses, which undermines the credibility of his current promise to abstain from illegal \ndrug use. Id. at 5. Also, Applicant admitted he knew he would be fired if he disclosed his drug \ninvolvement in his 2017 e-QIP. \nApplicant\u2019s appeal asserts that the decision is contrary to his character and his conduct \nthroughout the investigation process, attempts to clarify his prior statements regarding his drug use \nhistory, and argues his family life, work performance, and support from his employer are reasons \nto grant his security eligibility.

Mendez, Esq., Chief Department Counsel \nFOR APPLICANT \nPro se \nThe Department of Defense (DoD) declined to grant Applicant a security clearance. On \nAugust 1, 2023, DoD issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the basis of that \ndecision \u2013 security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) of the National \nSecurity Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) in Appendix A of Security Executive Agent Directive 4 \n(effective June 8, 2017) and DoD Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive). On \nFebruary 21, 2024, Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals Administrative Judge Roger C. \nWesley denied Applicant\u2019s security clearance eligibility. Applicant appealed pursuant to Directive \n\u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30. \nThe SOR alleged that Applicant failed to timely file Federal and state income tax returns \nfor tax years 2009-2011 and 2017-2018. He is also alleged to be indebted for state taxes for tax \nyears 2017 to 2018, totaling approximately $10,246. The Judge found against Applicant on the \ntwo failure to file allegations. Although he failed to make a formal finding on the state tax debt, \nthe Judge found no applicable mitigating conditions in his analysis, and we interpret his decision \nas an adverse finding on that allegation as well. \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nIn Applicant\u2019s appeal brief, he points out factual errors in the Judge\u2019s decision, and \nsubmitted new evidence. Consistent with the following, we affirm. \nJudge\u2019s Findings of Fact and Analysis \nApplicant is in his mid-50s and has been employed by a defense contractor as an \ninformation technology specialist since September 2019. He attended college classes and earned \ncertificates in 2019. He enlisted in the Air National Guard (ANG) in 1995 and served 17 years of \nactive duty before his retirement in 2017. While on active duty with the ANG, Applicant served \nin a dual role as an active-duty service member and civilian employee. He has never held a security \nclearance, and he did not submit any exhibits for the Judge\u2019s consideration. \nTax records document that Applicant did not timely file his Federal and state income tax \nreturns for tax years 2009-2011 and 2017-2018. Tax records also document Applicant\u2019s \nindebtedness to a state tax authority for approximately $10,246, for tax year 2018. Applicant \nattributed his 2009-2010 tax-filing lapses to procrastination, and his 2017-2018 tax-filing failures \nto his mistaken reliance on a prior accountant he engaged to file his returns for those years. \nApplicant acknowledged that his 2009-2011 Federal tax returns were substitute-filed by the \nInternal Revenue Service (IRS) and that his pay was garnished to satisfy IRS-calculated taxes \nowed. His reliance on a prior accountant was never documented. Additionally, any attempts to \nsatisfy his state tax debts for tax years 2017-2018 are undocumented and unresolved. \nThe Judge held that without any evidence of IRS and state approved extensions of time to \nfile Federal and state tax returns, or satisfaction of the state tax debt, no mitigating condition \napplied. Applicants for security eligibility are expected to exercise diligence and care in meeting \ntheir financial responsibilities. \nDiscussion \nIn his appeal brief, Applicant claims that the Judge erred in certain factual findings with \nregard to his background, and he included additional evidence explaining his tax status and \nshowing efforts to resolve debts. \nIn deciding whether the Judge's rulings or conclusions are erroneous, we will review the \ndecision to determine whether: it does not examine relevant evidence; it fails to articulate a \nsatisfactory explanation for its conclusions, including a rational connection between the facts \nfound and the choice made; it does not consider relevant factors; it reflects a clear error of \njudgment; it fails to consider an important aspect of the case; it offers an explanation for the \ndecision that runs contrary to the record evidence; or it is so implausible that it cannot be ascribed \nto a mere difference of opinion. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 97-0435 at 3 (App. Bd. Jul. 14, 1998). \nWe agree that the Judge made factual errors in describing Applicant\u2019s background, \nincluding his military service, dates and types of employment with the National Guard, \ncharacterization of certification training as college classes, and not recognizing his previous \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nsecurity eligibility. In particular, Applicant states that he served on active duty from 1985 to 1995 \nand in the ANG from 1997 to 2017. He was also hired by the Army National Guard (ARNG) as a \nhelp-desk specialist from 2019 to 2020, and in his current position in 2020 as an information \nsystems security officer. He states that he did not attend college courses, rather it was a \ncybersecurity \u201cbootcamp,\u201d and that he held various security clearances since 1985. The Judge\u2019s \nconfusion regarding certain background information, however, constitutes harmless error because \nit does not likely affect the outcome of the case. ISCR Case No. 19-01431 at 4 (App. Bd. Mar. 31, \n2020). \nOur review of the record confirms that Applicant failed to file Federal and state tax returns \nwhen due and that he failed to demonstrate that he resolved his state tax debt when due. Guideline \nF recognizes that applicants who do not act responsibly in the handling of their finances, such as \nfiling tax returns when due, may also be irresponsible, unconcerned, or negligent in handling and \nsafeguarding classified information. Id. \nAdditionally, possession of a previously granted clearance does not give rise to any right \nor vested interest, nor does any favorable clearance decision preclude the Government from \nreassessing a person\u2019s security eligibility in light of current circumstances. ISCR Case No. 03\u00ad\n24144 at 6 (App. Bd. Dec. 6, 2005). Finally, with regard to additional or clarifying evidence \npresented on appeal, the Appeal Board is prohibited from considering new evidence on appeal and \ndoes not review cases de novo. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.29. \nApplicant has not established that the Judge committed harmful error. Our review of the \nrecord reflects that the Judge examined the relevant evidence and articulated a satisfactory \nexplanation for the decision, which is sustainable on this record. \u201cThe general standard is that a \nclearance may be granted only when \u2018clearly consistent with the interests of the national security.\u2019\u201d \nDepartment of the Navy v.

She left her job in May 2021, following notice of unsatisfactory \nperformance related to absences from work due to illness, and she was hospitalized with serious \nmedical issues for a month after being laid off. \nApplicant and her husband filed a Chapter 7 bankruptcy petition in February 1999 and \nreceived a discharge in May 1999. In January 2009, she and her husband filed another Chapter 7 \nbankruptcy petition and received a discharge in April 2009. On June 30, 2023, approximately three \nweeks after issuance of the SOR, Applicant and her husband filed a petition for Chapter 13 \nbankruptcy. The petition listed approximately $117,000 in debts, some of which were joint and \nothers were solely in her name or her husband\u2019s. (GX 3 at 27-30; GX 6 at 29-40) Their bankruptcy \npetition was granted and a five-year payment plan was approved. Applicant and her husband began \nmaking monthly payments of $1,905 in July 2023. The payments increased to $2,255 in November \n2023. As of the date of the hearing, ten payments had been made. \nThe Judge\u2019s Analysis \nBased upon these facts and Applicant\u2019s admissions, the Judge concluded that the record \nevidence established two disqualifying conditions under Guideline F: an inability to satisfy debts \nand a history of not meeting financial obligations. AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a), (c). He also concluded that none of \nthe mitigating conditions had been established. Specifically, he found that AG \u00b6 20(a)2 was not \nestablished because Applicant\u2019s delinquent debts were recent and numerous. The Judge also \nconcluded that AG \u00b6 20(b)3 was not established because, although Applicant had experienced \nperiods of unemployment and had health issues in the past, she had been employed since May \n2021, and there was no evidence that the current debts were the result of circumstances beyond \nher control. Although Applicant had completed the financial counseling required by the \n2 (a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to \nrecur and does not cast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n3 (b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person's control . . . and the individual \nacted responsibly under the circumstances; \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nbankruptcy court, the Judge found that AG \u00b6 20(c)4 was not established because she had completed \nonly ten months of a five-year Chapter 13 payment plan. The Judge noted that this was the third \ntime Applicant had filed bankruptcy and that there was insufficient evidence to conclude that the \npayments would continue and that Applicant\u2019s financial problems were clearly under control. \nConcluding that AG \u00b6 20(d)5 did not apply, the Judge addressed the timing of Applicant\u2019s \nbankruptcy filing, which was within weeks of the issuance of the SOR. \nDiscussion \nAlthough framed in terms of challenging the Judge\u2019s factual findings, Applicant\u2019s brief \nadvocates for an alternative weighing of the evidence. There is a difference between errors in a \njudge\u2019s findings of fact and errors in the conclusions drawn therefrom. See ISCR Case No. 21\u00ad\n02121 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2023). An applicant\u2019s \u201cdisagreement with the Judge\u2019s weighing of \nthe evidence, or an ability to argue for a different interpretation of the evidence, is not sufficient \nto demonstrate that the Judge weighed the evidence or reached conclusions in a manner that is \narbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.\u201d ISCR Case No. 06-17409 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct. 12, 2007). \nIn deciding whether the Judge\u2019s rulings or conclusions are erroneous, we will review the decision \nto determine whether: it does not examine relevant evidence; it fails to articulate a satisfactory \nexplanation for its conclusions, including a rational connection between the facts found and the \nchoice made; it does not consider relevant factors; it reflects a clear error of judgment; it fails to \nconsider an important aspect of the case; it offers an explanation for the decision that runs contrary \nto the record evidence; or it is so implausible that it cannot be ascribed to a mere difference of \nopinion. ISCR Case No. 97-0435 at 3 (App. Bd. Jul. 14, 1998). \nMoreover, there is a rebuttable presumption that the Judge considered all the record \nevidence unless the Judge specifically states otherwise, and a bare assertion that a judge did not \nconsider evidence is not sufficient to rebut that presumption. E.g., ISCR Case No. 19-03344 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Dec. 21, 2020). In this instance, the Judge\u2019s discussion of the potentially applicable \nmitigating conditions expressly addressed all relevant facts such as Applicant\u2019s health issues and \nher periods of unemployment. The mere presence of some favorable or mitigating evidence does \nnot require the Judge to make an overall favorable determination in the face of disqualifying \ncircumstances such as Applicant\u2019s. E.g. ISCR Case No. 04-08975 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2006). \nApplicant asserts that there was \u201cincorrect debt attribution\u201d because the decision stated that \n\u201call debt is in the Applicant\u2019s name.\u201d In her brief she avers that the \u201cChapter 13 Petition is in both \nthe Applicant\u2019s and her Spouse\u2019s names, making both responsible for the monthly Payment to the \nTrustee.\u201d The decision actually states that \u201call the credit cards were Applicant\u2019s.\u201d Decision at 3. \n4 (c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the problem from a legitimate and credible \nsource, such as a non-profit credit counseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved \nor is under control; \n5 (d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve \ndebts; \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(Emphasis added). Regardless, whether or not some of the debts are jointly owed with her husband \ndoes not change the fact that Applicant also is responsible for their payment, as well as for those \ndebts solely in her name. The implication that there was factual error is without merit. \nAlthough Applicant asserts that her debts were not recent because they were incurred a \nnumber of years ago, the concept of recency is not solely a matter of when a particular debt \naccrued. Rather, failure to meet financial obligations \u201cis a continuing course of conduct.\u201d ISCR \nCase No. 01-03695 at 2 (App. Bd. Oct. 16, 2002). Therefore, Applicant\u2019s assertion that her \nfinancial problems are not recent is inconsistent with the ongoing nature of her debts. E.g., ISCR \nCase No. 06-23369 at 4 (App. Bd. Aug. 1, 2008); ISCR Case No. 07-10575 at 4 (App. Bd. Jul. 3, \n2008) (holding that an unsatisfied debt is a continuing course of conduct for the purpose of \nmitigating condition 20(a)). \nAs part of his analysis of Applicant\u2019s overall financial history, the Judge correctly \nconsidered the timing of when Applicant addressed her debts, which is relevant in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s case for mitigation. An applicant who waits until her clearance is in jeopardy before \nresolving debts might be lacking in the judgment expected of those with access to classified \ninformation. See ISCR Case No. 15-01070 at 4 (App. Bd. Mar. 9, 2016). Although there is \nevidence that Applicant had begun the process of filing her third bankruptcy prior to issuance of \nthe SOR, the timing of the actual filing is, nonetheless, a relevant consideration.  \nA security clearance adjudication is not a proceeding aimed at collecting an applicant\u2019s \ndebts. Rather, it is a proceeding aimed at evaluating an applicant\u2019s judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 07-08049 at 5 (App. Bd. Jul. 22, 2008). The scope of \nGuideline F encompasses not only an Applicant\u2019s current financial situation, but also extends to \nhis or her financial history. In a Guideline F case, the Board has held that until an applicant has a \n\u201cmeaningful financial track record it cannot be said as a matter of law that [s]he has initiated a \ngood-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.\u201d ISCR Case No. 05-01920 \nat 5 (App. Bd. Mar. 1, 2007). The concept of \u201c\u2018meaningful track record\u2019 necessarily includes \nevidence of actual debt reduction through payment of debts.\u201d Id. Payment agreements such as a \nChapter 13 bankruptcy petition, are similar to promises to pay in the future, which are \u201cnot a \nsubstitute for a track record of paying debts in a timely manner and otherwise acting in a financially \nresponsible manner.\u201d See ISCR Case No. 19-01599 at 3 (App. Bd. Jan. 15, 2020). \nAlthough bankruptcy is a remedy available to debtors, an applicant must do more than \nmerely show that he or she relied on a legally available option such as bankruptcy in order to claim \nthe benefit of mitigation. ISCR Case No. 02-30304 at 3 (App. Bd. April 20, 2004). Reliance upon \nlegal defenses such as bankruptcy does not necessarily demonstrate prudence, honesty, and \nreliability, therefore, such reliance is of diminished probative value in resolving trustworthiness \nconcerns arising out of an applicant's financial problems. See ISCR Case No. 00-0345 at 2 (App. \nBd. Dec. 12, 2001) (discharge of a debt in bankruptcy does not preclude consideration of an \napplicant's history of financial problems); ISCR Case No. 02-06703 at 2 (App. Bd. Feb. 25, 2004). \n\"Ongoing bankruptcy proceedings do not insulate Applicant\u2019s financial problems from scrutiny.\u201d \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nISCR Case No. 15-00682 at 3 (July 13, 2016). Even if a debt has been discharged in bankruptcy, \na Judge should \u201cstill consider the underlying circumstances for what they may reveal about an \napplicant's judgment and reliability.\u201d ISCR Case No. 16-02246 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 8, 2017). To \nreceive full credit under AG \u00b6 20(d), an applicant must initiate and adhere \u201cto a good faith effort \nto repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.\u201d In the absence of a meaningful track record \nof repayments, it cannot reasonably be suggested that an applicant has initiated a good-faith effort \nto repay creditors or otherwise resolve debts. See ISCR Case No. 07-09304 at 5 (App. Bd. Oct. 6, \n2008). The Judge\u2019s findings are supported by the evidence and it was not error to have found that \nApplicant\u2019s bankruptcy did not constitute a good faith effort in addressing the debt to afford \nmitigation under AG \u00b6 20(d). \nApplicant has failed to establish any harmful error below. The record supports a conclusion \nthat the Judge examined the relevant evidence and articulated a satisfactory explanation for the \ndecision. The decision is sustainable on this record. \u201cThe general standard is that a clearance may \nbe granted only when \u2018clearly consistent with the interests of the national security.\u2019\u201d Department \nof the Navy v.

Mendez, Esq., Chief Department Counsel \nFOR APPLICANT \nSamir Nakhleh, Esq. \nThe Department of Defense (DoD) declined to grant Applicant a security clearance. On \nJune 6, 2023, DoD issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the basis of that \ndecision \u2013 security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) of the National \nSecurity Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) in Appendix A of Security Executive Agent Directive 4 \n(effective June 8, 2017) and DoD Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive). On July \n15, 2024, after conducting a hearing, Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals Administrative \nJudge Bryan J. Olmos denied Applicant\u2019s security clearance eligibility. Applicant appealed \npursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30. \nThe SOR alleged that Applicant has seven delinquent debts totaling about $32,750. The \nJudge found against Applicant on all SOR allegations except for one debt of $317. In her appeal \nbrief, Applicant argues for a reassessment of the Judge\u2019s findings and conclusions and asserts that \nthe Judge failed to consider all relevant evidence in mitigation, thus rendering the decision \narbitrary, capricious, and contrary to law.

She was previously divorced in 2017 and remarried in 2020. She has one child \nand three stepchildren, all teenagers. Applicant attributes her financial difficulties to inconsistent \nemployment, underemployment, and a failed business. She admitted all but two of the SOR \nallegations. \nApplicant has past-due indebtedness, largely due to financial difficulties beginning in 2021 \nbecause of a failed business with her spouse. Her business was impacted by the pandemic, and she \nincurred additional debt in an effort to save the business including pay-day loans in which she \ndefaulted. The Judge found that these were unusual circumstances that were beyond her control. \nFollowing her business failure, she tried reducing her expenses, sought new employment, and hired \na law firm to address her delinquent debts. However, she was unable to show the law firm took \nany action to legitimately dispute debts, negotiate debt reduction, or establish payments plans \ntoward debt resolution. One utility debt was paid after the hearing for which the Judge found in \nher favor. No mitigating conditions apply for the remaining debts. \nDiscussion \nIn her appeal brief, Applicant claims the Judge failed to consider all of the evidence, argues \nfor reconsideration of certain debt reduction efforts, and includes additional argument as to the \ncurrent status of some debts. \nIn deciding whether the Judge's rulings or conclusions are erroneous, we will review the \ndecision to determine whether: it does not examine relevant evidence; it fails to articulate a \nsatisfactory explanation for its conclusions, including a rational connection between the facts \nfound and the choice made; it does not consider relevant factors; it reflects a clear error of \njudgment; it fails to consider an important aspect of the case; it offers an explanation for the \ndecision that runs contrary to the record evidence; or it is so implausible that it cannot be ascribed \nto a mere difference of opinion. ISCR Case No. 97-0435 at 3 (App. Bd. Jul. 14, 1998). \nApplicant asserts that the Judge failed to consider that she hired a law firm to help resolve \nher debts. Our review of the record clearly confirms the Judge\u2019s consideration of Applicant\u2019s \nefforts to resolve debts, including her engagement of a law firm. The evidence however shows the \nlaw firm or Applicant failed to establish concrete efforts toward debt reduction, legitimate disputes, \nor debt resolution plans as a result of the law firm\u2019s efforts. Additionally, her testimony regarding \nefforts to resolve some debts was not supported by persuasive documentary evidence. We have \noften stated that a security clearance adjudication is not a proceeding aimed at collecting an \napplicant\u2019s debts. Rather, it is a proceeding aimed at evaluating an applicant\u2019s judgment, \nreliability, and trustworthiness. E.g., ISCR Case No. 07-08049 at 5 (App. Bd. Jul. 22, 2008). \nThe scope of Guideline F encompasses not only an Applicant\u2019s current financial situation, \nbut also extends to his or her financial history. As a general rule, an applicant is not required to be \ndebt-free nor to develop a plan for paying off all debts immediately or simultaneously. E.g., ISCR \nCase No. 09-08462 at 4 (App. Bd. May 31, 2011). However, an applicant must act responsibly \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ngiven his or her circumstances and develop a reasonable plan for repayment, accompanied by \nconcomitant conduct even if it may only provide for the payment of debts one at a time. ISCR \nCase No. 07-06482 at 3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008). What constitutes responsible behavior depends \non the facts of a given case and the fact that an applicant's debts will not be paid off for a long \ntime, in and of itself, may be of limited security concern. ISCR Case No. 09-08462 at 4. Relevant \nto the equation is an assessment as to whether an applicant acted responsibly given her limited \nresources See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 08-06567 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Oct 29, 2009). \nIt is reasonable for a Judge to expect applicants to present documentation about the \nsatisfaction of specific debts. ISCR Case No. 09-07091 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 11, 2010). Moreover, \nintentions to resolve financial problems in the future are not a substitute for a track record of debt \nrepayment or other responsible approaches. ISCR Case No. 11-14570 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct. 23, \n2013). \nNext, Applicant reasserts her efforts to resolve individual debts, citing to her testimony \nduring the hearing, and argues that she has acted responsibly during her financial challenges. None \nof her arguments are sufficient to establish that the Judge failed to consider her testimony or \ndocumentary evidence in his decision. Disagreement with the Judge\u2019s weighing of the evidence or \nan ability to argue for a different interpretation of the evidence is not sufficient to conclude that \nthe Judge weighed the evidence or reached conclusions in a manner that is arbitrary, capricious, \nor contrary to law. E.g., ISCR Case No. 06-17409 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct. 12, 2007). With regard to \nadditional or clarifying evidence presented on appeal, the Appeal Board is prohibited from \nconsidering new evidence on appeal and does not review cases de novo. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.29. \nApplicant has not established that the Judge committed harmful error. Our review of the \nrecord reflects that the Judge examined the relevant evidence and articulated a satisfactory \nexplanation for the decision, which is sustainable on this record. \u201cThe general standard is that a \nclearance may be granted only when \u2018clearly consistent with the interests of the national security.\u2019\u201d \nDepartment of the Navy v.

Applicant appealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30. \nThe SOR alleged eight delinquent consumer debts, a failure to timely file federal tax returns \nfor tax years 2017 through 2022, and a federal tax delinquency of approximately $29,900. In \nApplicant\u2019s answer to the SOR, he admitted the two federal tax allegations and three delinquent \ndebts and denied five delinquent accounts.

The record confirms that Applicant received a copy of the FORM on January 23, 2024, \nthat the FORM itself and the accompanying cover letter advised Applicant regarding his right to \nrespond, and that DOHA received no response prior to submitting the FORM to the Judge. \nApplicant\u2019s bare assertion that he mailed a response is insufficient to establish a prima facie \nshowing that he actually submitted documents that were not included in the record.

Government Exhibit (GE) 2 at 37. He confirmed \nthe foregoing period of marijuana use and his future intent during his associated interview in \nSeptember 2019 and was subsequently granted a Secret security clearance in about April 2020. \nGE 4 at 3; GE 1 at 39. \nSeveral months later, in October 2020, Applicant participated in a polygraph examination. \nDuring the initial testing, he disclosed that he used marijuana for the first time in May or June \n2018 after he moved to California, which continued until August 2018. GE 3 at 5. He asserted that \nhe ceased using the drug when he returned to Pennsylvania because he was not able to obtain it as \neasily as he had in California and because the drug was not legal in Pennsylvania. After \n\u201cphysiological reactions to the topic regarding personal involvement with illegal drugs\u201d were \nperceived, Applicant revealed more extensive information about his drug use history, including \noff-and-on marijuana use beginning when Applicant was in high school in 2012 and continuing \nthrough July 2020, and two incidents of cocaine use in 2015 and 2018. Id. at 4. Applicant explained \nthat he was aware when he was granted his clearance of the policy against drug involvement and \nacknowledged that his use in July 2020 occurred while holding a Secret clearance.

He \u201calso withheld \nthis information due to the fear of losing his position with [the defense contractor], as they are not \naware of [Applicant\u2019s] involvement with illegal drugs while employed with them and while \nholding a SECRET clearance.\u201d Id. \nApplicant was referred for a new security clearance investigation and, in both his March \n2021 SCA and July 2021 interview, he disclosed marijuana use from June 2011 to September \n2019, and asserted, \u201cI smoked marijuana for the first time in high school, and then stopped until \ncollege. In college I smoked with friends on occasion. I smoked more in grad school because I was \ndone football and then stopped once I intended to sign with\u201d the defense contractor employer. GE \n1 at 37; GE 5 at 2. Applicant disclosed no cocaine use in either of the 2021 investigation \ncomponents.1 \nBased on the foregoing, the SOR alleged under Guideline H that Applicant consumed a \ngummy edible containing Tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) in July 2020 while he was granted access \nto classified information, that he used and purchased marijuana and products containing THC from \nabout June 2011 until July 2020, and that he used cocaine twice, in 2015 and 2018. Under \n1 Applicant subsequently completed another SCA in April 2023, which he submitted into evidence after the hearing \nand was not considered in drafting the SOR. Post-Hearing Exhibit (PHE) A at 33. In that third SCA, Applicant asserted \nthat he stopped using marijuana in March 2019 when he intended to sign with the defense contractor employer, and \nthat he did not use from 2019 until 2021 when he \u201cunknowingly ate a marijuana gummy when on vacation with [his] \nbrother.\u201d Id.

He \nadmitted using marijuana, but only from June 2012 to June 2019, and admitted using cocaine \ntwice, but in 2016 and 2018. Id. at 7, 8. With respect to the Guideline E concerns, Applicant denied \ndeliberately falsifying either his 2019 or 2021 SCA. He explained that the omissions from his 2019 \nSCA regarding his cocaine use and 2019 THC use were the result of him failing to recall the \nincidents. Id. at 13. He provided no explanation for his failure to report his pre-2018 marijuana use \non the 2019 SCA. For his 2021 SCA, Applicant purportedly \u201cbelieved that the investigators would \nsimply use recent information from his previous clearance investigation, which had occurred only \ntwo years earlier, [and] mistakenly assumed that he did not have to provide any additional \ninformation to supplement his upgrade investigation.\u201d Id. at 12. \nFinding both the Guideline H and Guideline E concerns fully mitigated, the Judge held in \nApplicant\u2019s favor on all allegations and concluded, \u201cApplicant now clearly understands that illegal \ndrug use is prohibited in any form while holding a security clearance or while in a sensitive \nposition. He also understands that he must be honest and truthful throughout the entire security \nclearance investigation process and be extremely thorough. He must do everything to avoid any \nmistakes or errors. He knows that he is held to a high standard and he must consistently \ndemonstrate this understanding.\u201d Decision at 9. \nDiscussion \nThere is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance of a security clearance. See \nDorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th Cir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991). After \nthe Government produces evidence raising security concerns, an applicant bears the burden of \npersuasion concerning mitigation. See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. The standard applicable in security \nclearance decisions is that a clearance may be granted only when \u201cclearly consistent with the \ninterests of the national security.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). \n\u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security eligibility will be resolved \nin favor of the national security.\u201d AG \u00b6 2(b). \nOn appeal, the Government argues that the Judge\u2019s applications of the Guideline H and \nGuideline E mitigating conditions and her analysis under the Whole-Person Concept were \narbitrary, capricious, and not supported by the record evidence. For the reasons stated below, we \nreverse the Judge\u2019s decision. \nA judge\u2019s decision can be found to be arbitrary or capricious if it \u201cfails to examine relevant \nevidence, fails to articulate a rational connection between the facts found and the choice made, \nfails to be based on a consideration of relevant factors, involves a clear error of judgment, fails to \nconsider an important aspect of the case, or is so implausible as to indicate more than a mere \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ndifference of opinion.\u201d ISCR Case No. 94-0215, 1995 WL 396942 at *3 (App. Bd. Apr. 13, 1995) \n(citing Motor Vehicle Mfr. Ass\u2019n v. State Farm Mut. Ins. Co., 463 U.S. 29, 43 (1983)). \nGuideline E Analysis \nHaving found that \u201cApplicant failed to provide thorough and complete information \nconcerning his illegal drug use in response to questions on his [SCAs] dated July 31, 2019, and \nMarch 24, 2021,\u201d the Judge determined that disqualifying conditions AG \u00b6\u00b6 16(a), 16(b), 16(d)2 \nwere applicable. Decision at 8. She went on to conclude that Applicant\u2019s conduct was mitigated \nthrough application of AG \u00b6 17(d) because he now \u201cunderstands what is required of him and how \nto properly complete his security clearance applications\u201d and \u201cwill hire counsel if he needs to.\u201d Id. \nApplication of this mitigating condition is both at odds with the Judge\u2019s disqualification analysis \nand unsupported by the record. \nContradictory Disqualification and Mitigation Analyses \nAs an initial matter, the Judge\u2019s mitigation analysis of the Guideline E concerns hinges on \nher finding that Applicant now understands how to properly complete an SCA, which implies that \nhe previously did not and that his multiple failures to provide full and complete answers were \ninadvertent rather than intentional. This analysis is directly at odds with the Judge\u2019s finding that \nApplicant \u201cwas attempting to conceal the true extent of his illegal drug history.\u201d Id. Although not \nraised by either party on appeal, such contradictory findings constitute error and render the \nresulting dependent mitigation analysis unsustainable. \nApplication of Guideline E Mitigating Condition \nTurning to the issues raised on appeal, the Government first argues that the Judge\u2019s \nmitigation analysis erroneously focused on \u201cApplicant\u2019s purported naivet\u00e9 and changed \ncircumstances,\u201d and thereby failed to consider important aspects of the case, including \n\u201cApplicant\u2019s numerous, varied, incomplete, and inconsistent disclosures of his drug use; the timing \nof his disclosures; and his education level\u201d and also \u201csubstituted a favorable credibility \ndetermination for record evidence.\u201d Appeal Brief at 10-11. The Government contends that the \nrecord does not support finding that Applicant\u2019s falsifying conduct is mitigated. We agree. \n2 AG \u00b6 16(a) \u2013 Deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from any personnel security \nquestionnaire, personal history statement, or similar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment \nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine national security eligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary \nresponsibilities; AG \u00b6 16(b) \u2013 Deliberately providing false or misleading information; or concealing or omitting \ninformation, concerning relevant facts to an employer, investigator, security official, competent medical or mental \nhealth professional involved in making a recommendation relevant to a national security eligibility determination, or \nother official government representative; AG \u00b6 16(d) \u2013 Credible adverse information that is not explicitly covered \nunder any other guideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an adverse determination, but which, when combined \nwith all available information, supports a whole-person assessment of questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, \nunreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating \nthat the individual may not properly safeguard classified or sensitive information. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAfter finding that Applicant falsified information on his 2019 and 2021 SCAs, the Judge \nwent on to find mitigation through application of AG \u00b6 17(d), a three-prong condition that affords \nmitigation when the individual 1) has acknowledged the behavior, 2) has obtained counseling to \nchange the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the stressors, circumstances, or factors \nthat contributed to untrustworthy, unreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and 3) such behavior \nis unlikely to recur. Application of this condition necessarily requires that an applicant first \nacknowledge the concerning behavior \u2013 in this case, the intentional falsification of relevant \ninformation from Applicant\u2019s 2019 and 2021 SCAs. The record is devoid of evidence that \nApplicant has ever acknowledged having intentionally falsified his 2019 or 2021 SCAs. To the \ncontrary, he has consistently and flatly denied falsifying the two documents. See, e.g., Tr. at 83, \n107. As a result, application of AG \u00b6 17(d) fails at the first prong. \nApplicant\u2019s failure to acknowledge the established falsifications also leads to AG \u00b6 17(d) \nfailing at the third prong, which requires a showing that the conduct is unlikely to recur. An \napplicant\u2019s acknowledgement of concerning conduct is an initial step in demonstrating acceptance \nof responsibility for his or her actions. When an applicant is unwilling or unable to accept such \nresponsibility, that failure \u201cis evidence that detracts from a finding of reform and rehabilitation.\u201d \nISCR Case No. 96-0360, 1997 WL 1882602 at *3 (App. Bd. Sep. 25, 1997). \nMoreover, in cases involving the deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of \nmaterial information, an applicant has a \u201cheavy burden in demonstrating evidence of reform, \nrehabilitation, or changed circumstances sufficient to justify a conclusion that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant him access to classified information.\u201d ISCR Case No. \n01-03132, 2002 WL 32114509 at *4 (App. Bd. Aug. 8, 2002). Other than to say that Applicant \n\u201cunderstands what is required of him and how to properly complete his [SCAs]\u201d and that he \u201cwill \nhire counsel\u201d as necessary in the future, the Judge points to no evidence and provides no analysis \nto support a finding that Applicant\u2019s conduct will not recur. To the contrary, Applicant\u2019s \nconcealment of the full extent of his drug use persisted from 2019 to as recently as April 2023, \nacross multiple SCAs, multiple interviews, and a polygraph examination. The Judge\u2019s implied \nfinding that Applicant\u2019s conduct will not recur is entirely speculative and entitled to less weight \nagainst the myriad unfavorable record evidence reflecting Applicant\u2019s actual past conduct. See \nISCR Case No. 06-17541, 2008 WL 351349 at *3 (App. Bd. Jan. 14, 2008) (\u201c[P]romises of future \ngood behavior carry less weight than a track record of reform and rehabilitation.\u201d). \nApplicant\u2019s only acknowledgement of having intentionally falsified any information \npursuant to any investigation component came after his unsuccessful attempt to conceal his drug \nuse history for a third time, which occurred during the initial testing of his 2020 polygraph. Only \nafter that attempted deception resulted in a perceived physiological response and triggered further \ninterviewing did Applicant admit his drug use history and that he intentionally withheld the \ninformation due to concerns that it would prevent him from obtaining a security clearance and \nresult in the loss of his job. The Judge appears to have given Applicant some minor credit for this \neventual disclosure of his drug use history, noting only that he \u201creveal[ed] it during his polygraph \nexamination.\u201d Decision at 8. The record reflects, however, that this disclosure was hardly \nvoluntary, coming only after Applicant first tried to conceal the information and was caught, which \nvitiates any credit afforded to it and raises serious concerns about his willingness to disclose \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nsecurity-significant conduct.3 It is not only troubling but also amounts to error that the decision is \nsilent on this important unfavorable evidence.

Sep. 3, 2004) (A judge may not ignore or disregard \u201csignificant record evidence \nthat a reasonable person could expect to be taken into account in reaching a fair and reasoned \ndecision.\u201d). The Judge erred in failing to identify Applicant\u2019s additional and admitted 2020 \npolygraph falsification and in failing to analyze it in terms of Applicant\u2019s pattern of falsifying \nmisconduct. \nThe Directive is clear that an applicant\u2019s failure to provide truthful and candid answers \nduring a security clearance investigation is of special concern, specifically stating that the \u201crefusal \nto provide full, frank, and truthful answers to lawful questions of investigators, security officials, \nor other official representatives\u201d in connection with a security clearance investigation and \nadjudication will normally result in an unfavorable eligibility determination. AG \u00b6 15. Considering \nthe record as a whole, the Judge\u2019s reliance on AG \u00b6 17(d) and her favorable Guideline E findings \nare not sustainable. \nGuideline H Analysis \nThe Judge found that Applicant used marijuana from about June 2011 until June 2019 and \nused cocaine on two occasions in 2015 and 2018, which was sufficient to raise disqualifying \nconditions AG \u00b6\u00b6 25(a) and 25(c).4 Despite her finding that Applicant last used marijuana in June \n2019 and the record evidence that Applicant was not granted a security clearance until April 2020, \nthe Judge also found AG \u00b6 25(f) applicable, which disqualifies based on an applicant\u2019s illegal drug \nuse while holding a sensitive position (i.e., one that requires security clearance eligibility). She \nwent on to conclude that Applicant\u2019s past drug use was mitigated through the four-year passage of \ntime since Applicant quit using illegal drugs in June 2019 and his signed statement of intent to \nabstain from future drug involvement. \nErroneous June 2019 Finding \nThe Government first challenges the Judge\u2019s finding that Applicant stopped using \nmarijuana in June 2019, arguing that the finding was unreasonable because Applicant\u2019s story was \n3 See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 17-02785, 2019 WL 3308102 at *3 (App. Bd. May 8, 2019). Further diminishing any \nindication that Applicant has accepted responsibility for falsifying multiple components of multiple security clearance \ninvestigations were his misleading assertions, both in response to the SOR and at hearing, that he realized his error in \ncompleting the 2019 SCA when he participated in the 2020 polygraph and then voluntarily corrected the mistake. See \nSOR Response at 14 (\u201c[Applicant] voluntarily offered [previously unreported drug use] information during his \npolygraph examination in 2020 out of a good-faith effort to correct his prior information.\u201d); Tr. at 83 (\u201cI elected to \ntake the polygraph in the following year, and divulged everything that we\u2019re talking about here today, and that was an \nelective thing. Just like I went in and took that polygraph because I had nothing to hide.\u201d). These mischaracterizations \nof the actual order of polygraph events are further evidence, which the Judge failed to consider, that Applicant has yet \nto accept responsibility for his multiple falsifications and that his attempts to obfuscate the record continued through \nits closing. \n4 AG \u00b6 25(a) \u2013 Any substance misuse; AG \u00b6 25(c) \u2013 Illegal possession of a controlled substance, including cultivation, \nprocessing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of drug paraphernalia. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n\u201ccompletely self-serving and . . . contradicted by the weight of the record.\u201d Appeal Brief at 15. \nHere again, we agree. \nThe Judge\u2019s finding that Applicant stopped using marijuana in June 2019 was based \nentirely on the following evidence, all of which post-dates the July 2023 SOR. In his September \n2023 SOR Response, Applicant asserted \u2013 for the first time during any record security clearance \nprocessing \u2013 that his \u201clast instance of illicit drug use of any kind occurred in June 2019 when he \ningested a THC gummy while spending time with his brother in California.\u201d SOR Response at 6. \nIn support of this, he provided a photo of himself with his brother in California, dated June 5, 2019. \nId. at Enc. 7. He also asserted \u2013 again, for the first time \u2013 that it was \u201can honest error\u201d and he \n\u201caccidentally input July 2020 as his last instance of drug use, instead of June 2019.\u201d Id. at 6. \nApplicant reiterated this June 2019 date and explanation for the error at hearing, and his brother \ntestified that he gave Applicant a THC gummy in June 2019. \nApparently considering only the foregoing, the Judge found Applicant\u2019s latest explanation \nof mistaken reporting and a cessation date of June 2019 to be credible.5 In doing so, however, she \nignored the following significant and contradictory record evidence, all of which predates the SOR. \nDuring his October 2020 polygraph, Applicant eventually disclosed that he last used \nmarijuana in July 2020 when he consumed a gummy edible that he knew contained marijuana \nwhile visiting his brother in California. GE 3 at 4-6. The recency of the reported use \u2013 a mere three \nmonths prior to the disclosure \u2013 lends to the accuracy of the July 2020 date. Applicant also twice \nacknowledged that his last marijuana use occurred while holding a Secret security clearance. \nBecause his security clearance was not granted until April 2020, this acknowledgment further \nsupports the accuracy of the July 2020 date. Finally, Applicant explained that his defense \ncontractor employer at the time was not aware of his \u201cinvolvement with illegal drugs while \nemployed with them\u201d and that he declined to report the incident to them because he did not want \nto lose his job. Id. at 6 (emphasis added). The record reflects that he began said employment in \nJuly 2019 \u2013 after his June 2019 California trip \u2013 which therefore supports that Applicant\u2019s last use \nof marijuana also occurred after the June 2019 California trip. See SOR Response at 2; AE A at 2; \nTr. at 54. The foregoing details and circumstances entirely undercut Applicant\u2019s post-SOR story \nand overwhelmingly support that he accurately reported in the polygraph that his last marijuana \nuse occurred in July 2020.6 \nWhen conflicts exist within the record, a judge must weigh the evidence and resolve such \nconflicts based upon a careful evaluation of factors such as the evidence\u2019s \u201ccomparative reliability, \n5 See Decision at 2 (\u201cApplicant specifically remembers the date of June 2019, as his last use of any illegal drug because \nat this time of use he was spending time with his brother in California. Applicant submitted a photograph of he and \nhis brother on this occasion.\u201d). \n6 During his polygraph, Applicant asserted that he stopped using marijuana after starting with his defense contractor \nemployer, and that he did not use the drug from that time until about July 2020. GE 3 at 4. In his 2023 SCA, Applicant \nreiterated the explanation that he initially ceased using marijuana after deciding to sign with the defense contractor \nemployer, but that he used the drug again as recently as September 2021 while on vacation with his brother.

The Judge\u2019s failure to explain how she found Applicant\u2019s post-SOR \nexplanation and cessation date more credible than other, more contemporaneous record evidence \nwas error. Such error is emphasized in light of Applicant\u2019s wildly inconsistent drug history \ndisclosures, which shifted through every major component of the investigation and adjudication \nprocesses, and the Judge\u2019s own conclusion that Applicant attempted to conceal the true extent of \nhis drug use history on multiple SCAs, all of which detract from his credibility. \nMoreover, while the Board typically gives deference to a judge\u2019s credibility determination \n(Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1), that deference is not without limits. When the record contains a basis to \nquestion an applicant\u2019s credibility, the judge \u201cshould address that aspect of the record explicitly,\u201d \nexplaining why she finds an applicant\u2019s explanation to be trustworthy. ISCR Case No. 07-10158, \n2008 WL 4635412 at *4 (App. Bd. Aug. 28, 2008). A judge\u2019s failure to do so \u201csuggests that she \nhas merely substituted a favorable impression of an applicant\u2019s demeanor for record evidence.\u201d Id. \nWith no recognition of the contrary evidence even identified, let alone analyzed in the decision, \nwe have no choice but to conclude that such is the case here. \nThe Board must consider \u201cnot only whether there is evidence supporting a judge\u2019s findings, \nbut also whether there is evidence that fairly detracts from the weight of the evidence supporting \nthose findings.\u201d ISCR Case No. 97-0727 at 3 (App. Bd. Aug. 3, 1998). Considering the record as \na whole, we conclude the Judge had an insufficient basis to find that Applicant stopped using \nmarijuana in June 2019. \nApplication of Guideline H Mitigating Conditions \nThe Government next argues that, as a result of her erroneous June 2019 factual finding \nand her unsupported credibility determination, the Judge\u2019s Guideline H mitigation analysis was \nunsupported by the record. The Judge concluded that Applicant\u2019s drug use history was mitigated \nfirst through application of AG \u00b6 26(a) because he \u201cquit using illegal drugs altogether in June 2019, \nand has been drug free for the past four years, which he intends to continue.\u201d Decision at 7. As \ndiscussed above and contrary to the Judge\u2019s factual finding, the great weight of the record evidence \nsupports that Applicant last used marijuana in July 2020, or possibly even more recently in \nSeptember 2021.7 In either case, the record supports that Applicant\u2019s last marijuana use occurred \nafter he submitted his 2019 SCA and participated in his 2019 clearance interview,8 after he was \ngranted security clearance eligibility in April 2020, with knowledge that such use was inconsistent \n7 See supra note 6. \n8 The Appeal Board has \u201clong held that applicants who use marijuana after having been placed on notice of the security \nsignificance of such conduct may be lacking in the judgment and reliability expected of those with access to classified \ninformation.\u201d ISCR Case No. 20-01772, 2021 WL 6202264 at *2 (App. Bd.

Feb. 13, 2023) (\u201c[A]fter applying for a security clearance and being \nadequately placed on notice that such conduct was inconsistent with holding a security clearance, an applicant who \ncontinues to use marijuana demonstrates a disregard for security clearance eligibility standards, and such behavior \nraises substantial questions about the applicant\u2019s judgment, reliability, and willingness to comply with laws, rules, and \nregulations.\u201d). \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nwith holding a clearance, and no more than three years prior to the hearing. All of these resulting \nfacts negatively impact upon the soundness of the Judge\u2019s application of AG \u00b6 26(a). \nThe Judge also found Applicant\u2019s conduct was mitigated through application of AG \u00b6 26(b) \nbecause he \u201chas signed a statement of intent which indicates that he must abstain from any drug \ninvolvement or substance misuse or his security clearance will be immediately revoked.\u201d Decision \nat 7. The Judge failed to explain, however, how she was able to find Applicant\u2019s Statement of \nIntent credible while simultaneously finding his credibility to be in question due to falsifying his \n2019 and 2021 SCAs. It is well settled that falsification of a security questionnaire carries serious \nnegative security implications and constitutes misconduct that casts serious doubt on an applicant\u2019s \njudgment, reliability, or trustworthiness. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 02-07555, 2004 WL 2152778 \nat *3 (App. Bd. Jul. 19, 2004) (\u201cAn applicant who deliberately tries to deceive or mislead the \nfederal government does not demonstrate the high degree of judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness that must be expected of persons granted access to classified information.\u201d). \nHaving found that Applicant deliberately falsified not one, but two SCAs, the Judge implicitly \nopined about Applicant\u2019s lack of trustworthiness and should have explained her reasons for \nbelieving his most recent promises advanced in his Statement of Intent. \nFurther with respect to his credibility, the record supports that Applicant\u2019s marijuana use \ncontinued to either July 2020 or September 2021 in spite of his repeated assertions throughout his \n2019 investigation that he had no intention to use illegal drugs again in the future. See GE 2 at 37; \nGE 4 at 3. To that end, the Judge\u2019s analysis failed to address why she found Applicant\u2019s Statement \nof Intent to abstain from future drug use credible considering the similar broken promise Applicant \nmade during his 2019 investigation. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 19-02499, 2021 WL 6201940 at *4 \n(App. Bd. Jul. 7, 2021) (reversing a favorable Guideline H decision where the Judge \u201cdid not \nprovide a meaningful analysis of [the applicant\u2019s drug counseling, religious involvement, current \nsobriety, and his promise to refrain from drug use in the future] in light of the countervailing \nevidence . . . , particularly Applicant\u2019s failed prior promises to abstain.\u201d). Moreover, the ongoing \nand recent nature of Applicant\u2019s falsifications, as discussed more fully above, further weaken any \ncredit to be afforded to his Statement of Intent. Overall, the Judge\u2019s application of AG \u00b6 26(b) is \nunsupported by the record and unsustainable. \nThe Government has met its burden on appeal of demonstrating reversible error below. \nConsidering the record as a whole, we conclude that the Judge\u2019s decision is arbitrary and capricious \nas it fails to consider important aspects of the case, fails to articulate a satisfactory explanation for \nmaterial conclusions, and runs contrary to the weight of the record evidence. Accordingly, the \nJudge\u2019s favorable decision under both Guidelines H and E is not sustainable under \nthe Egan standard. \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nOrder \nThe Judge\u2019s decision is REVERSED. \nSigned: Moira Modzelewski \nMoira Modzelewski \nAdministrative Judge \nChair, Appeal Board \nSigned: Gregg A.

Mendez, Esq., Chief Department Counsel \nFOR APPLICANT \nPro Se \nThe Department of Defense (DoD) declined to grant Applicant a security clearance. On August \n8, 2023, DoD issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the basis of that decision \u2013 \nsecurity concerns raised under Guideline B (Foreign Influence) of the National Security Adjudicative \nGuidelines (AG) in Appendix A of Security Executive Agent Directive (SEAD) 4 (effective June 8, \n2017) and DoD Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive). Applicant requested a decision \nbased on the written record, without a hearing. The Government submitted a File of Relevant Material \n(FORM) containing the entire record and the Government\u2019s argument. Applicant filed a reply. On May \n7, 2024, Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals Judge Bryan J. Olmos issued a decision denying \nApplicant\u2019s security clearance eligibility. Applicant appealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and \nE3.1.30. \nThe SOR alleged that two of Applicant\u2019s brother are citizens and residents of Iraq and that \nanother resides in Saudi Arabia and is a dual citizen of the United Kingdom and Iraq. It also alleged \nthat Applicant has a property interest in Iraq and that his father-in-law is a dual citizen of Iraq and \nthe United States. In his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted all of the allegations with \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nexplanations. The Judge found in Applicant\u2019s favor regarding his father-in-law and against \nApplicant as to the other allegations. \nOn appeal, Applicant asserts that he was adversely impacted by his election to have the \ncase decided based upon the administrative record and that the Judge failed to correctly consider \nthe evidence. Consistent with the following, we affirm. \nJudge\u2019s Findings of Fact and Analysis \nThe Judge made the following findings of fact relevant to this appeal: Applicant is 49 years \nold and was born in Iraq where he was raised and educated. From about October 2003 through \nFebruary 2006, after completing mandatory Iraqi military service, he was employed as an engineer \nwith construction companies working on infrastructure projects in Iraq for U.S. Government \nagencies. This work was inherently dangerous, and Applicant received at least two credible threats. \nDecision at 3; Applicant Exhibit (AE) E. After learning that insurgents knew the names of \neveryone on his project, Applicant left his job and subsequently moved to the United Arab \nEmirates (UAE), where he worked as a civil engineer for an international construction company. \nln 2010, Applicant submitted a Special Immigrant Visa (SIV) application to immigrate to the \nUnited States. The application was approved, and he entered the United States in June 2012. \nShortly thereafter, he returned overseas where he worked in the UAE and visited Iraq through \nJanuary 2014. In 2014, he married a dual citizen of Iraq and the United States. They reside in the \nUnited States and have two children who are U.S. citizens. In January 2020, Applicant became a \nnaturalized U.S. citizen. \nApplicant has five brothers who live outside of the United States. Two are citizens and \nresidents of Iraq with whom Applicant communicates on a regular basis. A third brother is a dual \ncitizen of the United Kingdom and Iraq, working in Saudi Arabia. A fourth brother is a dual citizen \nof Iraq and Austria who lives in Austria. Applicant\u2019s fifth brother is a citizen of Iraq and lives in \nthe UAE. Applicant's father-in-law immigrated to the United States in 2009 and was naturalized \nas a United States citizen in 2015. He is a dual citizen of the U.S. and Iraq but has not returned to \nIraq since he entered the United States. \nFollowing the deaths of their mother and father, Applicant and his brothers inherited their \nfamily home in Iraq. Applicant stated that he maintains his Iraqi citizenship in order to protect his \nfinancial interest in this property. He claimed that \"an inside settlement will be done soon,\" in \nwhich his brothers will acquire his share. Decision at 4. Applicant and his family intend to remain \nin the United States, and he is willing to renounce his Iraqi citizenship. He asserted that he cannot \nbe manipulated by a foreign person or organization as a result of his relationships with his Iraqi \nfamily members or his partial ownership of property in Iraq. \nThe Judge concluded that the concerns raised by Applicant\u2019s father-in-law were mitigated \nbut that no mitigating conditions were applicable to the other allegations. \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \nDiscussion \nIn his Appeal, Applicant argues that he \u201cmade a big mistake by requesting an \nadministrative [decision] in lieu of a hearing.\u201d Brief at 1, 2, 7. He also questions why he was denied \neligibility for access to classified information while others whom he believes are similarly situated \nwere granted eligibility. Additionally, he asserts that the Judge did not consider his SIV status. \nThese assertions of error lack merit. \nEnclosure 3 of the Directive explains the differences between a hearing and a decision \nbased on the written record. Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.17, E3.1.18. Applicant was provided a copy of the \nDirective when he received the SOR. With this information available to him, he chose to have his \ncase decided on the written record. Nothing in either the record or Applicant\u2019s appeal brief \nindicates that he lacked the mental competence or basic ability to make that decision. The totality \nof the circumstances reflect that Applicant made informed decisions throughout these proceedings. \nMerely because he now has decided that he might have presented a better case if he had proceeded \ndifferently, it does not follow that he was denied the opportunity to prepare and present his case. \nISCR Case No. 00-0086 at 2 (App. Bd. Dec. 13, 2000). \nAfter examining the record as a whole, we conclude that Applicant received adequate \nnotice of his forum options and his right to submit evidence. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 20-01217 \nat 3 (App. Bd. Jul. 19, 2021). There is no assertion of a procedural irregularity, nor any indication \nthat Applicant\u2019s choice was not freely made. Applicant was not denied the due process rights \nafforded by the Directive. See ISCR Case No. 10-06437 at 2-3 (App. Bd. Mar. 11, 2013). \nApplicant's brief also presents arguments based on the anecdotal experiences of other \nclearance applicants; however, this analogy is misplaced. Every clearance applicant\u2019s adjudication \nrests upon particular factual circumstances that do not establish any precedent in other cases. An \napplicant's suitability for a security clearance is not increased or decreased based on how the cases \nof other applicants were processed or handled. ISCR Case No. 09-04216 at 3 (App. Bd. Jan. 31, \n2011); ISCR Case No. 11-02842 at 3 (App. Bd. Jun. 7, 2012). The fact another applicant may have \nbeen granted eligibility for access to classified information under what Applicant believes are \nsimilar circumstances has no bearing on his case because each case is decided upon its unique facts \nand own merits. Directive, Encl. 2, App. A \u00b6 2(b); ISCR Case No. 19-00657 at 3 (App. Bd. Jul. \n21, 2021). \nApplicant also argues that the Judge did not consider the fact that he immigrated from Iraq \nthrough the SIV program. However, the Judge specifically addressed this in his findings of fact, \nhis discussion of the mitigating conditions, and in his whole-person analysis. Although Applicant\u2019s \ncontributions to U.S. operations in Iraq are important to be considered, such conduct is not, in and \nof itself, dispositive. Rather, it must be evaluated in light of the entire record, with particular \nattention to evidence of circumstances that pose foreseeable risks to the applicant of pressure or \ncoercion. ISCR Case No. 21-00068 at 3 (App. Bd. Jul. 6, 2022); ISCR Case No. 13-00142 at 4 \n(App. Bd. Oct. 15, 2014). The circumstances surrounding Applicant\u2019s Special Immigrant Visa are \nrelevant to a clearance adjudication and were considered by the Administrative Judge, however \nthe grant of a SIV does not, de-facto, equate to eligibility for access to classified information. See \nISCR Case No. 16-02061 at 2 (App. Bd. Sept. 19, 2018); ISCR Case No. 16-01900 at 2 (App. Bd. \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApr. 19, 2018); ISCR Case No. 16-00024 at 2 (App. Bd.

ISCR Case No. 16-01900 \nat 2, 3. \nThe remainder of Applicant\u2019s brief consists of a disagreement with the Judge\u2019s weighing \nof the evidence, which is not enough to show that the Judge weighed the evidence in a manner that \nwas arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 19-03344 at 3 (App. Bd. \nDec. 21, 2020). There is a rebuttable presumption that the Judge considered all the record evidence \nunless the Judge specifically states otherwise, and Applicant\u2019s bare assertion that the Judge did not \nconsider evidence is not sufficient to rebut that presumption. Id. \nWe have considered the entirety of the arguments contained in Applicant\u2019s appeal brief. \nThe record supports a conclusion that the Judge examined the relevant data and articulated a \nsatisfactory explanation for the decision, \u201cincluding a \u2018rational connection between the facts found \nand the choice made.\u2019\u201d Motor Vehicle Mfrs.

On September 13, 2024, Defense Office of Hearings and \nAppeals Administrative Judge Mark Harvey denied Applicant security clearance eligibility. \nApplicant appealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30. \nBackground \nThe SOR alleged that Applicant, in his mid-20s, was arrested three times between August \nand December 2020 for various domestic violence charges involving his girlfriend (\u201cMs. C\u201d), \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \nwhich conduct resulted in his administrative separation from the military.1 The record reflects the \nfollowing pertinent information regarding Applicant\u2019s criminal charges. \nOn August 19, 2020, police responded to a report that Applicant \u201chad just stabbed his \ngirlfriend.\u201d Government Exhibit (GE) 6 at 6. Upon police arrival, he admitted to the stabbing and \nwas subsequently arrested and charged with felony Malicious Wounding. Id.; GE 7 at 8. \nOn October 15, 2020, while released on bond for the pending Malicious Wounding charge, \npolice responded to a report that Ms. C was gathering her belongings and Applicant \u201cplaced his \narms around her neck in a [choke] hold.\u201d GE 7 at 5, 6. He was arrested and charged with Attempted \nStrangulation of Another. Id. at 5, 10. \nWhile the foregoing charges were pending, Applicant disclosed to the police that, earlier \nin mid-2020, he pointed a loaded rifle at Ms. C and stated that he would kill her, and that Ms. C \nhad recorded the incident on video. GE 8 at 5. As a result, on December 3, 2020, Applicant was \ncharged with Assault and Battery Against a Household Member and Pointing, Holding or \nBrandishing a Firearm. Id. \nOn December 17 and 18, 2020, the strangulation, assault and battery, and brandishing cases \nwere addressed through a global resolution. Applicant pled guilty to the brandishing charge and \nwas sentenced to 180 days in jail, with all but four days suspended, and 12 months\u2019 supervised \nprobation. GE 7 at 38; GE 9. In exchange for the plea, the strangulation charge was dismissed. GE \n7 at 38; GE 8 at 6. Applicant also pled guilty to domestic assault and battery and received a deferred \nsentence for twenty-four months while he was placed on supervised probation with other \nconditions. GE 8 at 6-7. \nAs a result of his criminal conduct, Applicant was administratively separated with an Other \nThan Honorable (OTH) discharge from the military in September 2021. GE 1 at 19-20. \nThe remaining Malicious Wounding charge was disposed of on August 30, 2023, when \nApplicant pled guilty to a reduced charge of Unlawful Wounding. GE 4. He was sentenced to five \nyears\u2019 incarceration with all but one month suspended if Applicant followed certain conditions, \nincluding that he complete anger management counseling and \u201cremain of uniform good behavior,\u201d \namong others. Id. \nThe Judge noted favorably that Applicant\u2019s most recent criminal offense was in December \n2020, he is no longer involved with Ms. C, and he has an excellent employment record as indicated \nby his character statements. The Judge ultimately found adversely on all allegations, however, \nconcluding that Applicant committed three crimes against Ms. C in 2020, which \u201care serious and \ntoo recent to be fully mitigated,\u201d and that he is currently on probation and is scheduled to remain \nso until August 2028. Decision at 8, 9. Moreover, Applicant \u201cwas not honest and candid at his \nhearing when he claimed a lack of memory of details about his relationship with Ms. C and \nspecifics of the assaults.\u201d Id. at 9. While acknowledging Applicant\u2019s favorable character evidence, \nthe Judge concluded that the \u201cevidence against mitigation is more persuasive.\u201d Id. \n1 The single Guideline F concern was withdrawn at hearing and is not an issue on appeal. \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nDiscussion \nApplicant\u2019s primary argument on appeal is that the Judge incorrectly found that he will \nremain on probation through 2028, which error he contends \u201cskewed the evaluation of [his] \ntrustworthiness\u201d and \u201cunfairly framed [his] legal situation and exaggerated the perceived risk.\u201d \nAppeal Brief at 18. In support of this argument, Applicant repeatedly asserts that he is on \u201cgood \nbehavior\u201d for the 2020 unlawful wounding charge and 2023 conviction, which he contends is not \nthe same as being on probation.2 This argument is unpersuasive for several reasons. \nFirst, Applicant\u2019s attempt to distinguish between \u201cprobation\u201d and \u201cgood behavior\u201d is \nunsupported by the record. The record reflects that, as part of his Plea Agreement for the Malicious \nWounding charge, Applicant\u2019s five-year prison sentence was largely suspended contingent upon \nhis adhering to certain conditions, including that he \u201cremain of uninform good behavior during \nincarceration and for 5 years thereafter.\u201d GE 4 at 1. At hearing, Applicant testified as follows \nregarding his probation status: \nGOVERNMENT: [Y]ou are to remain in of uniform, good behavior \nduring incarceration and for five years thereafter, correct? \nAPPLICANT: Correct. \nGOVERNMENT: So that would mean if you served in \napproximately August of 2023, that would take you up through \nAugust of 2028, correct? \nAPPLICANT: Correct. \nGOVERNMENT: So those conditions are still active, correct? \nAPPLICANT: Correct. \nTr. at 33. At no time during the hearing or at any other point in the record did Applicant contest \nthat he was currently on probation, and he offered no evidence to support that his probation could \nor would end earlier than the five years originally imposed. Additionally, there is no evidence that \n\u201cgood behavior\u201d is a separate and distinct post-conviction status than \u201cprobation.\u201d Rather, \nremaining on \u201cgood behavior\u201d appears to be \u2013 and generally is \u2013 a condition of probation. The \nJudge\u2019s finding that Applicant was on probation and was scheduled to remain on probation until \nAugust 2028 is based on substantial record evidence, as is his application of disqualifying \ncondition AG \u00b6 31(c). \n2 \u201cI am on good behavior for my August 2023 unlawful wounding conviction.\u201d Appeal Brief at 2; \u201cI am on good \nbehavior for the unlawful wounding conviction and not under probation supervision for this incident.\u201d Id. \u201c[T]he \nunlawful wounding charge does not entail ongoing probation supervision; instead, I am required to maintain good \nbehavior, which is not the same as being on probation.\u201d Id. \u201cI am on good behavior following my conviction in August \n2023, and I am not on probation or this conviction.\u201d Id. at 18. \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant also challenges the Judge\u2019s finding that he made inconsistent statements about \nthe altercations and his relationship, which \u201cdamaged his credibility and reflect[ed] poorly on his \nrehabilitation.\u201d Decision at 8. Applicant asserts that \u201c[a]ny inconsistencies in [his] testimony were \nnot intended to mislead but resulted from the emotional distress caused by reliving these incidents \nand the amount of time that had passed since the events\u201d and requests that the Board \u201cconsider the \nstress and trauma [he] experienced when assessing [his] testimony.\u201d Appeal Brief at 11. The \nAppeal Board gives deference to a judge\u2019s credibility determinations, and we find no cause to \ndisturb the unfavorable credibility determination in this matter. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1. \nThe remainder of Applicant\u2019s appeal amounts to a request for reconsideration based upon \nthe nature of his relationship with Ms. C and the circumstances leading to his arrests. The Appeal \nBoard does not review cases de novo, and an applicant\u2019s ability to argue for a different \ninterpretation of the evidence \u201cis not sufficient to demonstrate that the judge weighed the evidence \nor reached conclusions in a manner that is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.\u201d ISCR Case \nNo. 06-17409 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct. 12, 2007). \nConditional Clearance Request \nApplicant asks that, in the alternative to reversing the Judge\u2019s unfavorable decision, he be \ngranted a conditional security clearance. Applicant has not established that the granting of an \nexception under Appendix C of the Adjudicative Guidelines is merited. \nConclusion \nApplicant has not established that the Judge committed harmful error. Our review of the \nrecord reflects that the Judge examined the relevant evidence and articulated a satisfactory \nexplanation for the decision, which is sustainable on this record. \u201cThe general standard is that a \nclearance may be granted only when \u2018clearly consistent with the interests of the national security.\u2019\u201d \nDepartment of the Navy v.

Applicant elected a decision based on the written \nrecord. On April 17, 2024, Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals Administrative Judge Carol \nG. Ricciardello denied Applicant\u2019s security clearance eligibility. Applicant appealed pursuant to \nDirective \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30. \nUnder Guideline F, the SOR alleged three delinquent consumer debts.

Applicant explains that he is unable \nto produce these emails because he no longer has access to his work email account after losing his \njob, but he does not provide any further details about his submissions or a copy of what was \npurportedly emailed. \nThe record confirms that Applicant received a copy of the FORM on February 2, 2024, \nthat the FORM itself and the accompanying cover letter advised Applicant regarding his right to \nrespond, and that DOHA received no response prior to submitting the FORM to the Judge.

Mendez, Esq., Chief Department Counsel \nFOR APPLICANT \nPro se \nThe Department of Defense (DoD) declined to grant Applicant a security clearance. On \nJuly 28, 2023, DoD issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the basis of that \ndecision \u2013 security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) of the National \nSecurity Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) in Appendix A of Security Executive Agent Directive 4 \n(effective June 8, 2017) and DoD Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive). On \nMarch 7, 2024, after conducting a hearing, Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals \nAdministrative Judge Richard A. Cefola denied Applicant\u2019s security clearance eligibility. \nApplicant appealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30. \nThe SOR alleged that Applicant has 33 delinquent debts totaling about $11,800, and a \nChapter 7 Bankruptcy discharged in 2014. The Judge found against Applicant\u2019s on all of the SOR \nallegations. In his appeal brief, Applicant points out factual errors in the Judge\u2019s decision and \nasserts that the Judge failed to consider relevant evidence in mitigation. Consistent with the \nfollowing, we affirm. \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nJudge\u2019s Findings of Fact and Analysis \nApplicant is in his early-40s and has been employed by a defense contractor since May \n2019. He is married and has three stepchildren. Applicant attributes his financial difficulties to a \nbrief period of unemployment in 2019. He admitted to all of the SOR allegations. \nApplicant has significant past-due indebtedness. Although he was unemployed in 2019, his \nindebtedness is ongoing. He has a history of delinquencies, including a 2014 Chapter 7 bankruptcy \ndischarge of earlier debts, and has not demonstrated that further financial problems are unlikely. \nNo mitigating conditions apply. \nDiscussion \nIn his appeal brief, Applicant claims that the Judge erred in certain factual findings with \nregard to his background, argues for reconsideration of certain efforts he has made to resolve debts, \nincludes additional argument as to the current status of some debts, and raises an allegation of bias. \nIn deciding whether the Judge's rulings or conclusions are erroneous, we will review the \ndecision to determine whether: it does not examine relevant evidence; it fails to articulate a \nsatisfactory explanation for its conclusions, including a rational connection between the facts \nfound and the choice made; it does not consider relevant factors; it reflects a clear error of \njudgment; it fails to consider an important aspect of the case; it offers an explanation for the \ndecision that runs contrary to the record evidence; or it is so implausible that it cannot be ascribed \nto a mere difference of opinion. ISCR Case No. 97-0435 at 3 (App. Bd. Jul. 14, 1998). \nWe agree that the Judge made a factual error in omitting one of Applicant\u2019s children, but \nthe error is harmless as it does not likely affect the outcome of the case. ISCR Case No. 19-01431 \nat 4 (App. Bd. Mar. 31, 2020). \nApplicant next asserts that the Judge erred by not giving appropriate weight to a \nspreadsheet he submitted in mitigation and that he inappropriately characterized Applicant\u2019s \nfinancial status. Applicant also argues additional considerations for the whole-person analysis. \nDisagreement with the Judge\u2019s weighing of the evidence or an ability to argue for a different \ninterpretation of the evidence is not sufficient to conclude that the Judge weighed the evidence or \nreached conclusions in a manner that is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law. E.g., ISCR Case \nNo. 06-17409 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct. 12, 2007). Applicant has not established that the Judge \ncommitted harmful error. Our review of the record reflects that the Judge examined the relevant \nevidence and articulated a satisfactory explanation for the decision, which is sustainable on this \nrecord. \nWe have often stated that a security clearance adjudication is not a proceeding aimed at \ncollecting an applicant\u2019s debts. Rather, it is a proceeding aimed at evaluating an applicant\u2019s \njudgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. E.g., ISCR Case No. 07-08049 at 5 (App. Bd. Jul. 22, \n2008). The scope of Guideline F encompasses not only an Applicant\u2019s current financial situation, \nbut also extends to his or her financial history. As a general rule, an applicant is not required to be \ndebt-free nor to develop a plan for paying off all debts immediately or simultaneously. E.g., ISCR \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nCase No. 09-08462 at 4 (App. Bd. May 31, 2011). However, an applicant must act responsibly \ngiven his or her circumstances and develop a reasonable plan for repayment, accompanied by \nconcomitant conduct even if it may only provide for the payment of debts one at a time. ISCR \nCase No. 07-06482 at 3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008). \nIt is reasonable for a Judge to expect applicants to present documentation about the \nsatisfaction of specific debts. ISCR Case No. 09-07091 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 11, 2010). Moreover, \nintentions to resolve financial problems in the future are not a substitute for a track record of debt \nrepayment or other responsible approaches. ISCR Case No. 11-14570 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct. 23, \n2013). Additionally, a debt that became delinquent several years ago is still considered recent \nbecause \u201can applicant\u2019s ongoing, unpaid debts evidence a continuing course of conduct and, \ntherefore, can be viewed as recent for purposes of the Guideline F mitigating conditions.\u201d ISCR \nCase No. 15-06532 at 3 (App. Bd. Feb. 16, 2017). With regard to additional or clarifying evidence \npresented on appeal, the Appeal Board is prohibited from considering new evidence on appeal and \ndoes not review cases de novo. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.29. \nFinally, Applicant raises the possibility that the Judge was biased because of remarks he \nmade about a previous Applicant\u2019s \u201cspeech patterns\u201d that made it difficult to understand him. The \nrecord is devoid of evidence of the pre-hearing discussion, and Applicant has not raised sufficient \nevidence of bias to warrant action in his case by the Appeal Board. \nApplicant has not established that the Judge committed harmful error. Our review of the \nrecord reflects that the Judge examined the relevant evidence and articulated a satisfactory \nexplanation for the decision, which is sustainable on this record. \u201cThe general standard is that a \nclearance may be granted only when \u2018clearly consistent with the interests of the national security.\u2019\u201d \nDepartment of the Navy v.

On \nSeptember 29, 2023, DoD issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the basis for \nthat decision \u2013 security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) of the \nNational Security Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) of Security Executive Agent Directive 4 \n(effective June 8, 2017) and DoD Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive). \nApplicant requested a hearing, which was held on June 5, 2024. On July 12, 2024, Defense Office \nof Hearings and Appeals Administrative Judge LeRoy F. Foreman denied Applicant security \nclearance eligibility. Applicant appealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30. For reasons \nstated below, we affirm the Judge\u2019s decision. \nThe SOR alleged that Applicant failed to timely file federal and state tax returns for tax \nyears 2018 through 2022, that he owes $59,360 for federal tax years 2011 through 2017, and that \nhe owes approximately $38,000 on four delinquent student loans.

He retired from the military in 1999 and has been employed by \ndefense contractors since 2002, with intermittent periods of unemployment. He admits that he failed \nto file federal and state tax returns for 2018 through 2022 and that he owes delinquent federal income \ntaxes for tax years 2011 through 2017. After obtaining assistance from a tax attorney, he filed his \nfederal income tax returns for 2018 through 2022 in October 2023. Applicant owes approximately \n$16,000 in delinquent taxes for those years, in addition to what he owes for 2011 thorough 2017. He \nhopes to reach a settlement with the IRS. Applicant also filed his delinquent state tax returns for \n2020, 2021, and 2022 in October 2023 and filed his state tax returns for 2018 and 2019 in December \n2023. He also admits to owing the student loan debts alleged in the SOR for which no payments \nhave been made since 2014. Shortly before commencement of the hearing, Applicant began to \naddress these loans with the assistance of a private company and now is enrolled in the Department \nof Education\u2019s Fresh Start program. However, there is no evidence that any payments have been \nmade on those loans. \nNot alleged in the SOR was the fact that Applicant owes approximately $11,000 in state taxes \nand that he also filed his 2014 through 2016 federal tax returns late. This was not considered for \ndisqualifying purposes but was appropriately considered in the application of mitigating conditions \nand in the Judge\u2019s whole-person analysis. \nApplicant attributes his financial difficulties to his periods of unemployment, multiple \nmarital breakups, and his adult son\u2019s and his ex-wife\u2019s medical issues. \nIn light of these facts, the Judge concluded that, although there were some circumstances \nbeyond Applicant\u2019s control, he had not established that he acted responsibly and in good faith to \naddress and resolve his financial obligations. \nDiscussion \nOn appeal, Applicant challenges certain facts and states that he is \u201crebutting\u201d the Judge\u2019s \ndecision. When an administrative judge\u2019s factual findings are challenged, the Board must \ndetermine whether the findings of fact are supported by such relevant evidence as a reasonable \nmind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion in light of all the contrary evidence in the \nsame record and whether the judge\u2019s findings reflect a reasonable interpretation of the record \nevidence as a whole. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1; ISCR Case No. 02-12199 at 2-3 (App Bd. Aug. 8, \n2005). In deciding whether the Judge\u2019s rulings or conclusions are erroneous, we will review the \ndecision to determine whether: it does not examine relevant evidence; it fails to articulate a \nsatisfactory explanation for its conclusions, including a rational connection between the facts \nfound and the choice made; it does not consider relevant factors; it reflects a clear error of \njudgment; it fails to consider an important aspect of the case; it offers an explanation for the \ndecision that runs contrary to the record evidence; or it is so implausible that it cannot be ascribed \nto a mere difference of opinion. ISCR Case No. 97-0435 at 3 (App. Bd. Jul. 14, 1998). \nThe Government\u2019s burden is to prove its case by substantial evidence, which was clearly \nmet in this instance through Applicant\u2019s admissions, his testimony, and the documentary evidence. \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nOnce the Government established a prima facie case against him, Applicant had the ultimate \nburden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue \na security clearance. Thus, the burden was on Applicant to present witnesses and other evidence \nto rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the security concerns raised by his failure to timely file his \ntax returns. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. \nApplicant\u2019s challenge largely conflates \u201cfacts\u201d with the Judge\u2019s \u201cconclusions.\u201d Regardless, \nhowever, of whether considered to be facts or conclusions, the allegations of error are without \nmerit because the Judge\u2019s factual findings and conclusions are amply supported by the record. It \nis undisputed that the tax returns at issue were not filed until years after they were due, that taxes \nare owed, and that the student loans are delinquent. Our review of the Judge\u2019s decision confirms \nthat he considered all relevant issues and properly applied the mitigating conditions. \nVoluntary compliance with rules and systems is essential for protecting classified \ninformation. ISCR Case No. 14-06686 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 27, 2016). A person who repeatedly \nfails to fulfill his or her legal obligations does not demonstrate the high degree of good judgment \nand reliability required of those granted access to classified information. E.g., ISCR Case No. 15\u00ad\n05478 at 4 (App. Bd Oct. 2, 2017). We have noted that \u201c[a] security clearance represents an \nobligation to the Federal Government to protect national secrets. Accordingly, failure to honor \nother obligations to the Government has a direct bearing on assessing an applicant\u2019s reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and ability to protect classified information.\u201d Id. Applicant\u2019s failures to comply \nwith federal and state tax laws and to timely pay his federal student loan debt suggest that he has \na problem with voluntarily abiding by well-established government rules and regulations, which \ncalls into question his suitability for a security clearance. \nApplicant\u2019s appeal is premised on the incorrect belief that he mitigated the Government\u2019s \nconcerns because he eventually filed his delinquent tax returns and entered a payment program \nwith the Department of Education. However, as the Judge noted, a security clearance adjudication \nis not a proceeding aimed at inducing an applicant to meet his financial obligations. Rather, it is a \nproceeding aimed at evaluating an applicant\u2019s judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. Decision \nat 7. E.g., ISCR Case No. 07-08049 at 5 (App. Bd. Jul. 22, 2008). Accordingly, the Judge was \nobligated to consider the facts and circumstances surrounding the failure to timely meet \nApplicant\u2019s tax-filing obligations. Similarly, even though Applicant has recently taken steps to \nenter the Department of Education\u2019s Fresh Start program, this does not erase Applicant\u2019s past \nfailure to address his student loans. \nThe timing of the resolution of financial problems is an important factor in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s case for mitigation because \u201can applicant who begins to resolve financial problems \nonly after being placed on notice that his clearance was in jeopardy may lack the judgment and \nself-discipline to follow rules and regulations over time or when there is no immediate threat to \nhis own interests.\u201d ISCR Case No. 15-05478 at 5. Evidence suggesting that, after years of apparent \ninattention, Applicant was finally energized to file his tax returns when his clearance eligibility \nmight be imperiled raises questions about his willingness to follow the rules governing classified \ninformation when his personal interests are not at stake. \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nOverall, Applicant\u2019s brief advocates for an alternative weighing of the evidence. An \napplicant\u2019s \u201cdisagreement with the Judge\u2019s weighing of the evidence, or an ability to argue for a \ndifferent interpretation of the evidence, is not sufficient to demonstrate that the Judge weighed the \nevidence or reached conclusions in a manner that is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.\u201d ISCR \nCase No. 06-17409 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct. 12, 2007). Moreover, there is a rebuttable presumption that \nthe Judge considered all the record evidence unless the Judge specifically states otherwise, and a \nbare assertion that the Judge did not consider evidence is not sufficient to rebut that presumption. \nE.g., ISCR Case No. 19-03344 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 21, 2020). \nApplicant has failed to establish any harmful error below. The Judge appropriately \nconsidered circumstances beyond Applicant\u2019s control such as his periods of unemployment and \nhis son\u2019s and ex-wife\u2019s medical conditions. The overall record supports a conclusion that the Judge \nexamined the relevant evidence and articulated a satisfactory explanation for the decision. The \ndecision is sustainable on this record. \u201cThe general standard is that a clearance may be granted \nonly when \u2018clearly consistent with the interests of the national security.\u2019\u201d Department of the Navy \nv.

Mendez, Esq., Chief Department Counsel \nFOR APPLICANT \nSamir Nakhleh, Esq. \nThe Department of Defense (DoD) declined to grant Applicant a security clearance. On \nOctober 19, 2023, DoD issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the basis for \nthat decision \u2013 security concerns raised under Guidelines J (Criminal Conduct) and E (Personal \nConduct) of the National Security Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) of Security Executive Agent \nDirective 4 (effective June 8, 2017) (SEAD 4) and DoD Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as \namended) (Directive). Applicant requested a hearing, which was held on March 13, 2024. On July \n25, 2024, Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals Administrative Judge Richard A. Cefola \nconcluded that it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant security \nclearance eligibility. Applicant appealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30. \nThe SOR alleged that Applicant had been arrested on five occasions and that he failed to \nidentify those arrests when filling out his security clearance application. In his response to the \nSOR, Applicant admitted the allegations. At hearing, the Judge granted the Government\u2019s request \nto amend the SOR to cross-allege the Guideline J arrests under Guideline G (Alcohol \nConsumption). The Administrative Judge found against Applicant on the Guideline J and E \nallegations and for Applicant under Guideline G. Our review of the Judge\u2019s decision confirms that \nhe considered all relevant issues and properly applied the mitigating conditions in concluding that \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s personal and criminal conduct concerns were unmitigated. Consistent with the \nfollowing, we affirm. \nDiscussion \nOn appeal, Applicant does not directly challenge the Judge\u2019s factual findings, but rather \nargues that \u201cthe Administrative Judge did not consider all the evidence, both favorable and \nunfavorable, in a comprehensive, common-sense manner, and the Administrative Judge rendered \na decision that was arbitrary, capricious, and contrary to law.\u201d Appeal Brief at 2 (emphasis in \noriginal). He elaborates on this by stating that the \u201cAdministrative Judge failed to adequately \nconsider the mitigating factors.\u201d Id. at 8. However, Applicant\u2019s challenge conflates evidentiary \n\u201cfacts\u201d with the Judge\u2019s \u201cconclusions\u201d and fails to recognize the difference between a judge\u2019s \nsubstantive failure to consider evidence and a party\u2019s qualitative opinion that a judge did not \n\u201cadequately\u201d consider the evidence as part of his or her analysis. An analysis that merely is \nconsidered inadequate in the eyes of a party does not equate to an analysis that is arbitrary and \ncapricious. \u201cUnless a Judge\u2019s weighing of the record evidence is patently absurd, clearly illogical, \nor obviously unreasonable, the appealing party must present a cogent reason or argument as to \nhow or why the Judge\u2019s weighing of the record evidence is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to \nlaw.\u201d ISCR Case No. 03-05072 at 4 (App. Bd. Jul. 14, 2005). Applicant has not asserted a factual \nbasis that would support a conclusion that the Judge\u2019s analysis of the facts and his conclusions \nwere arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law. \nWhen an administrative judge\u2019s factual findings are challenged, the Board must determine \nwhether the findings of fact are supported by such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might \naccept as adequate to support a conclusion in light of all the contrary evidence in the same record \nand whether the judge\u2019s findings reflect a reasonable interpretation of the record evidence as a \nwhole. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1; ISCR Case No. 02-12199 at 2\u20133 (App Bd. Aug. 8, 2005). In deciding \nwhether the Judge\u2019s rulings or conclusions are erroneous, we will review the decision to determine \nwhether: it does not examine relevant evidence; it fails to articulate a satisfactory explanation for \nits conclusions, including a rational connection between the facts found and the choice made; it \ndoes not consider relevant factors; it reflects a clear error of judgment; it fails to consider an \nimportant aspect of the case; it offers an explanation for the decision that runs contrary to the \nrecord evidence; or it is so implausible that it cannot be ascribed to a mere difference of opinion. \nISCR Case No. 97-0435 at 3 (App. Bd. Jul. 14, 1998). \nThe Government\u2019s burden is to prove its case by substantial evidence, which was clearly \nmet in this instance through Applicant\u2019s SOR admissions, his testimony, and the documentary \nevidence. Once the Government established a prima facie case against him, Applicant had the \nultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or \ncontinue a security clearance. Thus, the burden was on Applicant to present witnesses and other \nevidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the security concerns raised by his arrests and \nthe circumstances surrounding them. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. \nRegardless of whether the allegations of error raised in Applicant\u2019s brief are considered to \nbe facts or conclusions, the assertions are without merit because the Judge\u2019s findings and \nconclusions are amply supported by the record. The mere presence of some mitigating evidence \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ndoes not require the Judge to make an overall favorable determination in the face of disqualifying \nconduct such as Applicant\u2019s. See ISCR Case No. 04-08975 at 1 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2006). \nApplicant\u2019s brief simply advocates for an alternative weighing of the evidence. An applicant\u2019s \n\u201cdisagreement with the Judge\u2019s weighing of the evidence, or an ability to argue for a different \ninterpretation of the evidence, is not sufficient to demonstrate that the Judge weighed the evidence \nor reached conclusions in a manner that is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.\u201d ISCR Case \nNo. 06-17409 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct. 12, 2007). Moreover, Applicant\u2019s arguments fail to rebut the \npresumption that the Judge considered all of the record evidence. \nApplicant has failed to establish any harmful error below. We have considered the entirety \nof the arguments contained in his appeal brief. The record supports a conclusion that the Judge \nexamined the relevant evidence and articulated a satisfactory explanation for the decision, \n\u201cincluding a \u2018rational connection between the facts found and the choice made.\u2019\u201d Motor Vehicle \nMfrs.

Mendez, Esq., Chief Department Counsel \nFOR APPLICANT \nPro se \nThe Department of Defense (DoD) declined to grant Applicant a security clearance. On \nSeptember 29, 2023, DoD issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the basis \nof that decision \u2013 security concerns raised under Guideline E (Personal Conduct) and Guideline F \n(Financial Considerations) of the National Security Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) in Appendix A \nof Security Executive Agent Directive 4 (effective June 8, 2017) and DoD Directive 5220.6 (Jan. \n2, 1992, as amended) (Directive).

The Government submitted a File of Relevant Material (FORM) containing the \nentire record and the Government\u2019s argument. Applicant filed a reply. On April 30, 2024, Defense \nOffice of Hearings and Appeals Administrative Judge Marc E. Curry denied Applicant\u2019s security \nclearance eligibility. Applicant appealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30. \nThe SOR alleged under Guideline E that, in 1989, Applicant was charged by the military \nwith misuse and abuse of privileges; allowing an unauthorized person to operate a military \nregistered vehicle overseas; crossing an international border without appropriate travel documents; \nand failure to obey an order. In December 1989, Applicant fled to a foreign country and remained \nabsent without leave (AWOL) from the U.S. Army.

Under Guideline F, Applicant \nis alleged to have 10 delinquent debts. Applicant admitted all of the SOR allegations, and the Judge \nfound against him on the Guideline E allegation and all but one Guideline F allegation. \nOn appeal, Applicant argues the Judge decided the case citing \u201c\u2018by the book\u2019 bureaucratic \nreasonings and process,\u201d and he requests a review based on \u201cfactors and objective national security \ninterests and on realistic potential\u201d on how he could contribute his strengths, abilities, and \nexperience. Consistent with the following, we affirm. \nJudge\u2019s Findings of Fact and Analysis \nApplicant is in his early-60s. He immigrated to the United States in 1983 and became a \nnaturalized citizen in 1988. He served in the U.S. Army from 1984 to 1988 and received an \nhonorable discharge. He then joined the Army National Guard in 1988, and while serving in \nGermany, requested travel to his home country to visit family. His request was denied because he \ndid not meet the deadline for requesting travel to a communist country. Applicant then requested \nleave to travel within Germany. The leave was approved, but Applicant instead went to his home \ncountry in his personal vehicle and left it with his brother in that country without authorization. \nWhile these activities were being investigated, Applicant failed to report for duty, left the base, \nand was AWOL in his home country for seven years. In 1996, he was administratively separated \nfrom the Army National Guard with an Other Than Honorable discharge. The Judge found that \nApplicant\u2019s period of AWOL was a \u201cprofound breach of duty\u201d that was compounded by his lying \nto his command about his travel destination. \nApplicant incurred debts totaling about $81,000 that he attributes to charges to credit cards \nduring the COVID pandemic because of extended unemployment. The Judge found that he \nsatisfied one debt but failed to contact creditors or make reasonable payment or settlement plans \nfor the remaining nine debts. \nDiscussion \nOn appeal, Applicant does not allege the Judge committed harmful error but requests a de \nnovo review. Disagreement with the Judge\u2019s weighing of the evidence or an ability to argue for a \ndifferent interpretation of the evidence is not sufficient to conclude that the Judge weighed the \nevidence or reached conclusions in a manner that is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law. E.g., \nISCR Case No. 06-17409 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct. 12, 2007). The Appeal Board does not review cases \nde novo. The Board\u2019s authority to review a case is limited to cases in which the appealing party \nhas alleged the Judge committed harmful error. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32. Because Applicant has not \nalleged such a harmful error, the decision of the Judge denying Applicant security clearance \neligibility is sustainable. \nOur review of the record reflects that the Judge examined the relevant evidence and \narticulated a satisfactory explanation for the decision, which is sustainable on this record. \u201cThe \ngeneral standard is that a clearance may be granted only when \u2018clearly consistent with the interests \nof the national security.\u2019\u201d Department of the Navy v.

Shure, Esq., Department Counsel \nJulie R. Mendez, Esq., Chief Department Counsel \nFOR APPLICANT \nTodd A. Hull, Esq. \nThe Department of Defense (DoD) declined to grant Applicant a security clearance. On \nNovember 9, 2023, DoD issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the basis of \nthat decision \u2013 security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) and \nGuideline E (Personal Conduct) of the National Security Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) in \nAppendix A of Security Executive Agent Directive 4 (effective June 8, 2017) and DoD Directive \n5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive). On September 24, 2024, Defense Office of Hearings \nand Appeals Administrative Judge Pamela C. Benson granted Applicant security clearance \neligibility. The Government appealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30. \nUnder Guideline F, the SOR alleged ten delinquent state and federal income tax debts that \nbegin with tax year 2010. At hearing, the Judge granted the Government\u2019s motion to amend the \nSOR by deleting the word \u201cdelinquent\u201d in each of those allegations. The SOR also alleged two \nfailures to timely file tax returns, which, on a motion by the Government, were amended to only \nallege unpaid taxes similar to the other Guideline F allegations. Finally, the Judge granted the \nGovernment\u2019s motion to delete the Guideline E allegations. \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \nOn appeal, the Government asserts that the Judge\u2019s conclusion to grant Applicant eligibility \nfor access to classified information is arbitrary, capricious, contrary to law, and unsupported by \nthe record evidence. For the reasons discussed below, we remand. \nBackground \nApplicant is in his mid-60s, married, and has three adult children. He was honorably \ndischarged from the United States military in May 1990 and has been working in a U.S. Embassy \nas a contractor employee in the Middle East since 2009. In late October 2023, he was evacuated \nfrom his overseas place of employment and returned to the U.S. due to security threats posed by \nnearby regional conflicts. He remained in the U.S. until returning to his workplace in late April \n2024. Tr. at 145. \nIn response to the SOR and in his hearing testimony, Applicant acknowledged his tax debt \nbut maintained that all of the allegations were covered under a section of the tax code that provides \nmilitary members serving in designated combat zones and civilians supporting those troops the \noption to defer filing income tax returns and payment of related taxes. 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7508 (Time for \nperforming certain acts postponed by reason of service in combat zone or contingency operation).1 \nThis deferral is permitted for up to 180 days after leaving the combat zone at which point the tax \nobligations become due. 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7508(a)(1)(B).2 Applicant\u2019s home state of Missouri also \npermits deferral of state tax payments. Applicant apparently plans to continue to work in the \ndesignated combat zone for another 10 to 12 years and to defer tax payments under Section 7508 \nuntil such time as he retires and returns to the United States. Tr. at 147. \nFor the years alleged in the SOR, Applicant and his wife have filed returns but not paid \nany federal income taxes beyond those minimal amounts that Applicant elected to withhold. \nApplicant\u2019s withholdings did not cover his total annual tax liability and, as of July 2024, his \ndeferred federal tax debt was in excess of $150,000 and will become due and payable after he is \nno longer working in a designated combat zone. 3 Applicant Exhibit (AE) E; Tr. at 91. Applicant \nused the majority of the money that he retained by deferring payment of income taxes to pay for \nhis children\u2019s educations and their post-college living expenses. Beyond that, Applicant appears \nto have lived a modest, debt-free lifestyle during the 14 years that he has claimed this deferral. \nApplicant did not invest or escrow money to address the future tax payment and he \nacknowledged that he would not have sufficient savings to make a lump sum payment of the taxes \nwhen due. Instead, he anticipates that his mother or in-laws will die before the taxes are due, \nallowing him to use inheritance funds to cover the debt. Tr. at 96-97, 158-159. To the extent that \n1 The parties and the Decision refer to this section of the tax code as the \u201cCombat Zone Tax Exemption \u2013 CZTE.\u201d \nHowever, the CZTE is the Combat Zone Tax Exclusion, which provides that military members may exclude from \ntheir taxable income certain earnings received while in the combat zone. 26 C.F.R. \u00a7 1.112-1 (Combat zone \ncompensation of members of the Armed Forces). The CZTE has no bearing on this case. Additionally, concurrent \ncitations to Section 7508 and subsection 7508(a) in the briefs and Decision are redundant inasmuch as they are not \nseparate statutes. \n2 The deferral may be extended for an additional period of time depending on when the individual entered the combat \nzone. See IRS Publication 3, Armed Forces\u2019 Tax Guide, dated February 27, 2024, at 29. \n3 Applicant also owes approximately $8,000 for his 2018 state tax balance.

Tr. at 129-130, 132. There was no inquiry at hearing \nnor is there any evidence shedding light on how Applicant would pay his tax debt in any of the \nquite foreseeable scenarios that would cause the debt to become due earlier than when he plans to \ndepart the combat zone in about 2035 (e.g., loss of employment, his own illness or injury, his \nwife\u2019s illness or injury, another regional conflict that triggers a long-term evacuation, or simply \nremoving the designation of his workplace as a combat zone). \nAt various times, Applicant consulted with a tax attorney and accountants and presented \nevidence from professionals who opined that he was eligible to avail himself of the benefits of \nSection 7508. However, Applicant\u2019s tax transcripts reflect that the IRS did not always apply this \nprovision to his tax returns, and, in some instances, he was charged interest and penalties for failing \nto timely pay taxes. While this was reversed for some years after an accountant contacted the IRS \non Applicant\u2019s behalf (e.g. GE 2 at 7-11; AE D), there remain years for which no deferment was \nallowed and penalties and interest were assessed. GE 2 at 29-41; AE E (tax years 2017-2020, 2022\u00ad\n2023). Applicant and his wife referred to this as a \u201ccoding\u201d problem as opposed to an eligibility \nissue and said that they have made some efforts to contact the IRS. Tr. 104-106, 108, 188. Still, as \nof July 2024, there is no evidence that the IRS has applied the Section 7508 deferral to those tax \nyears.4 Even if Section 7508 is applicable, Applicant owes in excess of $150,000 in federal and \nstate taxes at this time because of the continuing deferral. \nDiscussion \nOn appeal, the Government argues that the Judge\u2019s decision is arbitrary and capricious. \nSpecifically, the Government asserts that the Judge failed to properly consider the following \naspects of the case: whether Applicant previously had the ability to pay his tax debt; whether he \nhas the current ability to satisfy his tax debt or is unduly relying on being allowed to set up a \npayment plan; Applicant\u2019s failure to set up a payment plan when he was out of the combat zone \nfor over 180 days; the unreasonableness of Applicant\u2019s support of his adult children well beyond \ntheir college education; Applicant\u2019s failure to make voluntary payments to reduce his tax debts; \nApplicant\u2019s failure to change his withholdings to reduce his continued tax indebtedness; and \nApplicant\u2019s inability to pay the entirety of the tax debt before his death. Appeal Brief at 11. \nIn deciding whether the Judge\u2019s rulings or conclusions are arbitrary and capricious, we will \nreview the decision to determine whether: it does not examine relevant evidence; it fails to \narticulate a satisfactory explanation for its conclusions, including a rational connection between \nthe facts found and the choice made; it does not consider relevant factors; it reflects a clear error \nof judgment; it fails to consider an important aspect of the case; it offers an explanation for the \ndecision that runs contrary to the record evidence; or it is so implausible that it cannot be ascribed \n4 Although the Government appears to have accepted that Applicant has met the IRS criteria for postponing tax \npayment deadlines (see Tr. at 11; Appeal Brief at 20, 22), the record is ambiguous about his eligibility for the extension \nunder Section 7508. \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \nto a mere difference of opinion.

Co., 463 U.S. 29, 43 (1983). \nThe Judge found that Applicant was compliant with federal tax laws and that, once he is \nout of a combat zone for 180 days, he will be required to initiate a payment plan. Limiting her \nreview to AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a), (b), (c), and (f),5 she concluded that the Government had failed to meet its \nevidentiary burden \u201cas there is no evidence of any wrongdoing by Applicant.\u201d Decision at 6. \nHowever, the issue in this case is not exclusively \u201cwrongdoing\u201d but, even assuming Applicant is \neligible for the benefits of Section 7508, whether or not he acted responsibly when availing himself \nof those benefits. \nThe Government\u2019s brief sets out a litany of alleged errors that collectively argue that the \nJudge failed to adequately evaluate whether or not Applicant\u2019s deferral of tax payments and his \nplan for paying the accumulated balance was reasonable and responsible within the meaning of \nthe broad Guideline F concern.6 We do not need to address all of the Government\u2019s assertions, as \nwe concur that the Judge failed to adequately assess the reasonableness of Applicant\u2019s accrual of \nsignificant debt in the context of the viability and reasonableness of his proposed plan for \nrepayment. \nThe operative issue in terms of a potential security concern is whether it was reasonable \nand responsible for Applicant to have availed himself of Section 7508\u2019s benefits year after year \nwhen viewed in the context of whether or not he has a viable plan to pay the taxes when due. \nSimply acting in accord with the deferral aspect of Section 7508 does not de facto provide \nimmunity from scrutiny in the context of a security clearance assessment under the Guidelines. \nWhile it may be permissible to defer tax payments, mere reliance upon a legally available program \ndoes not necessarily erase the security concerns arising from the overall situation. C.f. ISCR Case \nNo. 14-06440 at 4 (App. Bd. Jan. 8, 2016). The analysis must include an assessment of how \nApplicant intends to address the tax debt when it comes due and the viability of that intention \nbecause paying the deferred taxes is not a hypothetical event; it is an inevitable reality, whether it \noccurs in 2035 when he intends to retire or earlier due to some unforeseen event. \nIt is the Judge\u2019s responsibility to assess the reasonableness of deferring tax debt in the \ncontext of Applicant\u2019s ability to repay it. The Judge concluded that \u201c[she] cannot speculate whether \nhe has the financial means to pay his deferred taxes once he is required by law to do so, but their \nintentions are to pay the taxes when due.\u201d Decision at 6. As such the Judge focused on Applicant\u2019s \nintentions without considering whether those intentions are realistic or assessing the judgment \nreflected in Applicant\u2019s taking advantage of the benefits of Section 7508 relative to his ability to \nmeet the long-term financial obligations when those taxes come due. However, it is the Judge\u2019s \nresponsibility to consider the viability of Applicant\u2019s conduct relative to his hypothetical payment \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 19: (a) an inability to satisfy debts; (b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so; (c) a \nhistory of not meeting financial obligations; and (f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local \nincome tax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as required. \n6 See AG \u00b6 18: \u201cThe Concern. Failure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial obligations may \nindicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified or sensitive information.\u201d \n5 \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nplan. \u201c[A]n administrative judge is required to make predictive judgments about the likelihood of \n. . . current and future risks based on present circumstances.\u201d ISCR Case No. 02-26978 at 3 (App. \nBd. Sep. 21, 2005). Although the grant or denial of a security clearance is an inexact science, a \njudge must assess an applicant\u2019s future actions in the context of the unforeseen impact of outside \nand unknown influences. Dep\u2019t of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528-29 (1988); C.f. ISCR Case \nNo. 18-02641 at 3 (App. Bd. Jul. 10, 2019). In this case, that uncertainty includes Applicant\u2019s \nreliance upon a potential inheritance and the possibility that the taxes may come due sooner than \nhe anticipates. The Judge also must conduct an in-depth assessment of the practicality of \nApplicant\u2019s plans to take certain actions in the future. See ISCR Case No. 98-0188 at 2 (App. Bd. \nApr. 29, 1999). Promises to take actions in the future, however sincere, are not a substitute for a \ndocumented track record or viable plan for debt payment. Review of this aspect of the Judge\u2019s \ndecision is not simply a matter of deferring to her weighing of Applicant\u2019s credibility as argued by \nApplicant. The Judge can find Applicant credible in terms of his professed intention to repay the \ndebts, but that does not eliminate the need to evaluate whether or not Applicant\u2019s deferral of tax \npayments was reasonable and responsible and his plan for paying them is feasible and reliable. \nAdditionally, the federal income tax system is a \u201cpay-as-you-go\u201d tax system, which means \nthat taxpayers must pay income tax as they earn or receive income during the year. This can be \naccomplished either through withholding or by making estimated tax payments. Taxpayers must \ngenerally pay at least 90% of their taxes due during the previous year to avoid an underpayment \npenalty. E.g., IRS Tax Tip 2021-81, June 8, 2021, https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/heres-how\u00ad\ntaxpayers-can-pay-the-right-amount-of-tax-throughout-the-year; Penalty for underpayment of \nestimated tax, https://www.irs.gov/taxtopics/tc306. Section 7508 does not provide an exemption \nfrom complying with standard withholding and estimated tax payment requirements. Applicant\u2019s \nwithholdings averaged approximately 50% of his obligation from taxable wage income. When he \nreceived a $130,000 settlement of a lawsuit, Applicant did not pay the related taxes. Had he been \nin compliance with those payment and withholding requirements, the amount due at the point when \nApplicant ultimately exits the combat zone would be significantly smaller. As such, not only was \nit error for the Judge to conclude that Applicant\u2019s conduct was not wrongful, there is substantial \nevidence that Applicant is unwilling to pay taxes when owed under the federal pay-as-you-go \nsystem. As such, the Judge erred in finding that AG \u00b6 19(b) and AG \u00b6 19(c) were inapplicable. \nHaving minimized his withholding and estimated tax payments, the manner in which \nApplicant used the funds is a significant facet of assessing the reasonableness of his tax payment \ndeferral. Therefore, the extent of Applicant\u2019s support of his adult children is relevant in terms of \nassessing the long-term plan for repayment inasmuch as it impacted Applicant\u2019s ability to address \nthe tax debt in the future. The windfall of funds from the deferral and under-withholding amounted \nto an interest-free loan. But, as with any loan, it must be entered into with prudence and a realistic \nplan to repay that loan. Without a lender acting as a gatekeeper to evaluate the ability to repay the \nloan, individuals invoking Section 7508 must weigh their ability to pay the tax debt when taking \nadvantage of deferral. To do otherwise reflects a lack of judgment under Guideline F. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \nThe reasonableness of Applicant\u2019s conduct and the likelihood of actually paying the \ndeferred tax debt raise disqualifying conduct under AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and (e),7 and it was error for the \nJudge to have concluded that the Government had not met its burden of proof under those \nparagraphs. AG \u00b6 19(a) is not limited to debts currently due. It equally applies in a situation such \nas this, in which existing debt will become due in the future. Similarly, AG \u00b6 19(e) is established \nwhen there is consistent spending beyond one\u2019s means or frivolous or irresponsible spending. \nApplicant has deferred taxes over a long period of time to the extent that they exceed $150,000. \nHe spent the proceeds gleaned from deferring tax payments without setting aside funds to pay the \ntaxes, he intends to continue to grow his tax debt, and he presented a tenuous repayment plan. It \nwas error for the Judge not to have found AG \u00b6 19(e) applicable in light of substantial evidence \nthat Applicant will be unable to meet his tax obligations regardless of his assertions that he intends \nto do so. \nFinally, the Government\u2019s claim that Applicant failed to establish a payment plan when he \nwas out of the designated combat zone for over 180 days raises unanswered factual questions that \nare critical to the assessment of this case \u2013 was Applicant already responsible for payment of the \ntaxes at the time of the hearing and, if so, was he able to meet that obligation? There is substantial \nevidence that Applicant returned to the United States on October 21 or 22, 2023, and that he \nreturned to his workplace in a designated combat zone on April 26 or 27, 2024. Tr. at 144-145. On \nits face, this reflects that he was out of the designated combat zone for more than 180 days and, as \nsuch, may have triggered immediate payment of deferred taxes. See ISCR Case No. 19-02207 at \n2 (App. Bd. May 20, 2020). The Judge recognized this issue during Applicant\u2019s testimony and \nquestioned him concerning it. In response, Applicant testified that he did not believe that this \nsituation changed his tax deferment status because it was the result of an involuntary evacuation. \nTr. at 156. However, there is no evidence that he consulted with a tax professional before reaching \nthis conclusion, nor is there corroboration for why this assumption was a reasonable one given the \nplain language of the statute. Tr. at 156. The Judge\u2019s decision did not address this important aspect \nof the case and, although she is presumed to have considered all evidence, it was error not to have \nexplicitly done so given this record.8 \nConclusion \nWhen the Board finds that a judge\u2019s decision is unsustainable, we must determine if the \nappropriate remedy is remand or reversal. The former is appropriate when the legal errors can be \ncorrected through remand and there is a significant chance of reaching a different result upon \ncorrection, such as when a judge fails to consider relevant and material evidence. If the identified \nerrors cannot be remedied on remand, the decision must be reversed. ISCR Case No. 22-01002 at \n4 (App. Bd. Sep. 26, 2024). In this instance, the Judge\u2019s conclusion that the Government failed to \n7 AG\u00b619(e): consistent spending beyond one\u2019s means or frivolous or irresponsible spending, which may be indicated \nexcessive indebtedness, significant negative cash flow, a history of late payments or of non\u00adpayment or other negative \nfinancial indicators. \n8 It may be necessary to reopen the record to further explore both the fundamental question of Applicant\u2019s eligibility \nfor Section 7508 and the specific question of whether Applicant\u2019s return to the U.S. triggered repayment of the \ndeferred taxes. As to the latter, Applicant\u2019s appellate argument that he \u201cremained employed by a site in a combat \nzone\u201d (emphasis added) is not tenable in the face of the statute which specifies that that the \u201cindividual\u201d be serving in \na designated combat zone.

Directive \u00b6 E3.132.3. The opinion of Applicant\u2019s witness \nis not binding on the Administrative Judge. In DOHA proceedings, the determination of pertinent \nfacts, policies and conclusions as to the allegations contained within an SOR and the ultimate \nquestion of whether it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or deny a security \nclearance rests solely with the Administrative Judge. Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. \n518, 527 (1988). Moreover, to the extent that Applicant believes the Judge denied his top-secret \nclearance, but not his secret clearance, he misunderstands the security eligibility process and \nmisreads the decision. The Judge ruled on Applicant\u2019s security eligibility, not a particular \nclearance level. The level of clearance currently held, or the level of clearance applied for, do not \naffect the Judge's analysis or the Board's review. Directive \u00b6 3.2 makes no distinction concerning \nbasic clearance levels in its procedures for deciding whether access to classified information is \nclearly in the national interest.

On October 3, 2024, Defense Office of \nHearings and Appeals Administrative Judge Edward W. Loughran denied Applicant security \nclearance eligibility. Applicant appealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30. \nApplicant, now in his mid-20s, completed a Questionnaire for Non-Sensitive Positions \n(SF85) in April 2021 wherein he disclosed no reportable drug use or misuse in the prior year. \nGovernment Exhibit (GE) 2 at 14.

Applicant requested a decision based on the written record, without a \nhearing. The Government submitted a File of Relevant Material (FORM) containing the \nGovernment\u2019s evidence and arguments.

He admits that he used and purchased marijuana while granted access to \nclassified information and/or while employed in a sensitive position. FORM Items 5, 9; SOR \nAnswer. Applicant self-disclosed his drug involvement on his 2023 security clearance application \n(SCA) admitting that, during a three-month period in 2022, he tried different forms of marijuana \na total of four to five times. He purchased the drugs in a state where marijuana sales and use are \nlegal under state law and used them in his home state where marijuana sales and use are illegal. \nHe reported his drug use to his facility security officer after completing his SCA and also discussed \nhis drug use during his security clearance interview. In his Answer to the SOR, Applicant stated it \nhad been his understanding that marijuana use was \u201ctreated like alcohol consumption: as long as \nit did not impact work or other personal affairs, it was not of any consequences to [his] security \nclearance.\u201d The Judge found that Applicant\u2019s involvement with marijuana was limited in scope \nand nature and that he stopped prior to his security clearance renewal. He concluded that \nApplicant\u2019s \u201csecurity clearance interview does not read consistently with a person stating an intent \nto use in the future, rather it appears consistent with a statement that he has no intention to use \nmarijuana or any other illegal drug in the future.\u201d Decision at 2. \nThe Judge found that Guideline H disqualifying conditions AG \u00b6\u00b6 25(a) and 25(c) applied;1 \nhowever, he concluded that the security concerns were mitigated under AG \u00b6\u00b6 26(a) and 26(b).2 \nThe mitigation analysis focused on a conclusion that \u201c[t]here is no evidence in the record that \nApplicant understood his [illegal drug] use to be problematic at the time and there was no evidence \nto the contrary\u201d and that Applicant voluntarily disclosed his actions on his SCA, acknowledged \nhis past actions, and clearly stated that he will no longer use any marijuana products. Decision at \n5. \nDiscussion \nOne of the Government\u2019s arguments on appeal is that the Judge\u2019s failure to apply \ndisqualifying condition AG \u00b6 25(f) was arbitrary, capricious, and not supported by the record \nevidence. In deciding whether the Judge\u2019s rulings or conclusions are arbitrary and capricious, we \nwill review the decision to determine whether: it does not examine relevant evidence; it fails to \narticulate a satisfactory explanation for its conclusions, including a rational connection between \nthe facts found and the choice made; it does not consider relevant factors; it reflects a clear error \nof judgment; it fails to consider an important aspect of the case; it offers an explanation for the \n1 (a) any substance misuse; (c) illegal possession of a controlled substance, including cultivation, processing, \nmanufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of drug paraphernalia. \n2 (a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened under such circumstances that it is unlikely \nto recur or does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; (b) the \nindividual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and substance misuse, provides evidence of actions taken to \novercome this problem, and has established a pattern of abstinence. \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ndecision that runs contrary to the record evidence; or it is so implausible that it cannot be ascribed \nto a mere difference of opinion. ISCR Case No. 95-0600, 1996 WL 480993 at *3 (App. Bd. May \n16, 1996) (citing Motor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass\u2019n v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., 463 U.S. 29, 43 \n(1983)). \nApplicability of Disqualifying Condition \u00b6 25(f) \nDisqualifying condition AG \u00b6 25(f) (any illegal drug use while granted access to classified \ninformation or holding a sensitive position) provides a basis for disqualification that is distinct \nfrom the simple drug use the Judge addressed under AG \u00b6\u00b6 25(a) and 25(c). Conduct falling under \nAG \u00b6 25(f) reflects a heightened security concern inasmuch as individuals who have already been \ngranted access to classified information or who hold sensitive positions are held to a higher \nstandard than individuals not similarly situated because of the existing potential to adversely \nimpact national security. See Security Executive Agent Directive 3, Reporting Requirements for \nPersonnel with Access to Classified Information or Who Hold a Sensitive Position (effective June \n12, 2017); ISCR Case No. 22-01661 at 3 (App. Bd. Sep. 21, 2023). It is undisputed that Applicant\u2019s \ndrug use occurred after he was granted access to classified information and/or was in a sensitive \nposition. Although he maintained that he was not working on a classified program at the time of \nhis drug use, that is of no consequence because he was employed in a sensitive position. See ISCR \nCase No. 22-02623 at 3 (App. Bd. Jan. 24, 2024). Despite the clear applicability of AG \u00b6 25(f), the \nJudge failed to address or even acknowledge that provision. This constitutes a failure to consider \na specifically alleged fact and the relevant and material evidence proffered in support the \nallegation. This failure reflects harmful error and renders the decision unsustainable. \nConclusion \nWhen the Board finds that a judge\u2019s decision is unsustainable, we must determine if the \nappropriate remedy is remand or reversal. The former is appropriate when the legal errors can be \ncorrected through remand and there is a significant chance of reaching a different result upon \ncorrection, such as when a judge fails to consider relevant and material evidence. If the identified \nerrors cannot be remedied on remand, the decision must be reversed. ISCR Case No. 22-01002 at \n4 (App. Bd. Sep. 26, 2024). In this instance, the Judge\u2019s failure to address AG \u00b6 25(f) was clearly \nerroneous and is best remedied through remand. \nHaving concluded that this error warrants a remand, the allegations of error regarding the \napplication of mitigating conditions AG \u00b6\u00b6 26(a) and 26(b) are not ripe for consideration. \nHowever, we note that the centerpiece of the Judge\u2019s mitigation analysis under AG \u00b6 26(a) is his \nconclusion that \u201c[t]here is no evidence in the record that Applicant understood his use to be \nproblematic at the time and there was no evidence to the contrary.\u201d Decision at 5. In support of \nthis, the Judge relied upon ISCR Case No. 23-02476 at 4\u20135(App. Bd. May 1, 2024) in which the \nBoard addressed the fact that, with the myriad of state statutes legalizing marijuana, a first-time \napplicant might not realize how continued use of marijuana is viewed in the context of a security \nclearance and federal drug laws. That case focused on whether the drug questions in Section 23 of \nthe SCA put applicants on notice that marijuana use is a security concern regardless of state laws. \nHowever, the relied-upon case is factually distinguishable and wholly inapplicable because \nApplicant was not seeking a clearance for the first time; he had been employed in a sensitive \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nposition and been granted eligibility for access to classified information for many years.

Mendez, Esq., Chief Department Counsel \nFOR APPLICANT \nPro se \nThe Department of Defense (DoD) declined to grant Applicant a security clearance. On \nSeptember 15, 2023, DoD issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the basis \nof that decision \u2013 security concerns raised under Guideline H (Drug Involvement and Substance \nMisuse) of the National Security Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) in Appendix A of Security \nExecutive Agent Directive 4 (effective June 8, 2017) and DoD Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as \namended) (Directive). Applicant requested a decision based on the written record, without a \nhearing. The Government submitted a File of Relevant Material (FORM) containing the entire \nrecord and the Government\u2019s argument. Applicant was provided an opportunity to respond, but he \ndid not submit a response. On March 21, 2024, Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals \nAdministrative Judge Roger C. Wesley denied Applicant\u2019s security clearance eligibility. Applicant \nappealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30. \nThe SOR alleged under Guideline H that Applicant used marijuana with varying frequency \nfrom about June 2017 to March 2022; and that he used marijuana in March 2022, while granted \naccess to classified information. Applicant admitted both SOR allegations, and the Judge found \nagainst him on both allegations. \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nOn appeal, Applicant contends the Judge failed to follow relevant law, regulations, and \ncurrent research with regard to marijuana, and argued for reconsideration of the decision to deny \nhim security eligibility. Consistent with the following, we affirm. \nJudge\u2019s Findings of Fact and Analysis \nApplicant is in his mid-twenties and has been employed by a defense contractor since \nJanuary 2023. He has held a security clearance since June 2021. He used marijuana with varying \nfrequency in social situations from June 2017 to March 2022. He acknowledged using marijuana \non one occasion in March 2022 while holding a security clearance and after receiving written \nnotice of the restriction on illegal drug use as early as June 2021. He has not used marijuana since \nand recommitted to abstinence. The Judge found that Applicant committed to abstinence in 2021 \nbut violated that commitment with his 2022 marijuana use. Despite his most recent commitment, \nit is too soon to absolve him of risks of recurrence. \nDiscussion \nOn appeal, Applicant contends the Judge\u2019s decision was based on \u201coutdated binding \nprecedent\u201d and claims the Judge disregarded current research on the effects of marijuana. He \nargues that Guideline H exists to \u201csafeguard U.S. classified information from being illegally \nreleased due to impairment and susceptibility.\u201d Appeal Brief at 1. He argues that his use of \nmarijuana could not have created a security breach because he is diligent with his \u201cinteractions \nand language\u201d; he used it at his home but was not adversely impaired; he avoids conversations \nabout sensitive work while in social settings; and alcohol impairs the brain significantly more than \nmarijuana. Id. Finally, Applicant pleads for reconsideration based on his age, reason, and mercy. \nThere is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance of a security clearance. See \nDorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th Cir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991). After \nthe Government produces evidence raising security concerns, an applicant bears the burden of \npersuasion concerning mitigation. See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. The standard applicable in security \nclearance decisions \u201cis that a clearance may be granted only when \u2018clearly consistent with the \ninterests of the national security.\u2019\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988).  \n\u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security eligibility will be resolved \nin favor of the national security.\u201d Directive, Encl 2, App. A \u00b6 2(b).  \nIn deciding whether the Judge\u2019s rulings or conclusions are erroneous, we will review the \nJudge\u2019s decision to determine whether: it does not examine relevant evidence; it fails to articulate \na satisfactory explanation for its conclusions, including a rational connection between the facts \nfound and the choice made; it does not consider relevant factors; it reflects a clear error of \njudgment; it fails to consider an important aspect of the case; it offers an explanation for the \ndecision that runs contrary to the record evidence; or it is so implausible that it cannot be ascribed \nto a mere difference of opinion. E.g., ISCR Case No. 14-02563 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Aug. 28, 2015). \nApplicant\u2019s assertions amount to a disagreement with Federal drug laws and policy. \nHowever, DOHA proceedings are not a proper forum to debate the pros and cons of whether \nmarijuana should be legal for some purposes, how it should be classified as a controlled substance, \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \nor the merits of DoD policy concerning drug abuse. E.g., ISCR Case No. 02-08613 at 2 (App. Bd. \nJan. 6, 2005). The Controlled Substances Act (\u201cCSA\u201d) currently categorizes marijuana as a \nSchedule I drug and makes it illegal under Federal law to manufacture, possess, or distribute \ncertain drugs, including marijuana. 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 801, \u00a7 812 \u00a7 844. The Supreme Court has ruled \nthat, under the Commerce Clause, Congress may ban the use of cannabis even where states approve \nits use for medicinal purposes. See Gonzales v. Raich, 545 U.S. 1 (2005). Although numerous \nstates and the District of Columbia have legalized certain marijuana-related activity, there is no \nFederal exception for state-legalized marijuana. \nApplicant understates the concern expressed under Guideline H.1 The Guideline H concern \nincludes use of an illegal substance that can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability and \ntrustworthiness, and a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations. \nAG \u00b6 24. The Judge found that Applicant\u2019s conduct clearly implicates this concern, especially how \nthe violation of his earlier commitment to abstinence and use while being granted access to \nclassified information \u201craises continuing concerns about his trustworthiness, reliability, and \njudgment.\u201d Decision at 6. We find the Judge\u2019s reasoning and conclusions are supported by the \nevidence. \nWith respect to Applicant\u2019s marijuana use, he admitted that he used marijuana with varying \nfrequency from 2017 to 2022, including in March 2022, after being granted access to classified \ninformation. This was a significant factor cited by the Judge that weighed against Applicant\u2019s \nsuitability for continuation of his security eligibility. In particular, an \u201cexpressed intent to continue \nillegal drug use, or failure to clearly and convincingly commit to discontinue drug use\u201d is \ndisqualifying. AG \u00b6 25(h). The record shows that Applicant completed security clearance \napplications (SCAs) in 2021 and 2023. In his June 2021 SCA, he stated \u201cI mean I don\u2019t plan on \nsmoking weed anymore, but I might. It\u2019s legal in my stated (sic), and unless the Government \nexplicitly tells me I cannot, I might keep smoking. I don\u2019t know though.\u201d Government Exhibit \n(GE) 5. During Applicant\u2019s personal subject interview (PSI) in July 2021, while discussing illegal \ndrug use, he stated, \u201cNever had a security clearance and will not engage in future with security \nclearance.\u201d GE 6. In his 2023 SCA, he repeated his previous SCA drug use statement, but added, \n\u201cAfter my last investigation, I took an edible (1) containing THC.\u201d GE 3. \nIn terms of eligibility for access to classified information, the Supreme Court's decision in \nDepartment of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518 (1988), provides that the grant, denial, or revocation \nof an industrial security clearance is the exclusive province of the Executive Branch of the Federal \nGovernment. See also Executive Order 10865. In Egan, the Court enunciated the general principle \nthat \u201cthe grant of a security clearance to a particular [individual], a sensitive and inherently \ndiscretionary judgment call, is committed by law to the appropriate agency of the Executive \nBranch.\u201d Id. at 527. The Court reasoned that the President\u2019s \u201cauthority to classify and control \naccess to information flows primarily from this constitutional investment of power in the President \n[citing U.S. Const., Art. II, \u00a7 2] and exists quite apart from any explicit congressional grant.\u201d Id. \n1 AG \u00b6 24. The Concern. The illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of prescription and non\u00ad\nprescription drugs, and the use of other substances that cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an individual's reliability and trustworthiness, both \nbecause such behavior may lead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises questions about a \nperson's ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations. \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nat 527, citing Cafeteria Workers v. McElroy, 367 U.S. 886, 890 (1961). The Court stated further \nthat \u201cthe authority to protect [national security] information falls on the President as head of the \nExecutive Branch and as Commander in Chief.\u201d Id. \nState laws cannot override provisions of a Federal national security program under the \nexclusive auspices of the Executive Branch evaluating the security implications of an individual\u2019s \nconduct. \u201c[S]tate laws allowing for the legal use of marijuana in some limited circumstances do \nnot pre-empt provisions of the Industrial Security Program, and the Department of Defense is not \nbound by the status of an applicant\u2019s conduct under state law when adjudicating that individual\u2019s \neligibility for access to classified information.\u201d ISCR Case No. 14-03734 at 3 (App. Bd. Feb. 18, \n2016). A security clearance adjudication remains a determination that must be made within the \nconfines of the basic premise that use of marijuana remains illegal under Federal law and illegal \ndrug use is inconsistent with holding a security clearance. See ISCR Case No. 20-01772 at 3 (App. \nBd. Sep. 14, 2021). Simply put, there is no exception that permits security clearance holders or \napplicants to use marijuana or any other drug that is illegal under Federal laws, regardless of state \nlaws that may permit such use.  \nSecurity clearance-related concerns arising from the legalization or decriminalization of \nmarijuana in a number of states were addressed in an October 25, 2014, memo issued by the \nDirector of National Intelligence (DNI Memo) and reiterated in clarifying guidance issued in 2021.   \nConsistent with the discussion, above, the DNI Memo unequivocally states that \"changes to state \nlaws and the laws of the District of Columbia pertaining to marijuana use do not alter the existing \nNational Security Adjudicative Guidelines. An individual's disregard of federal law pertaining to \nthe use, sale, or manufacture of marijuana remains adjudicatively relevant in national security \ndeterminations.\" The DNI Memo also explicitly states that \u201cunder federal law, use of marijuana \nremains unlawful,\u201d and \u201cwhile several states have decriminalized marijuana or allowed its use for \nmedical or recreational purposes, such use of marijuana remains subject to the applicable \ndisqualifying conditions in the Directive.\u201d See also ISCR Case No. 16-00258 at 2 (App. Bd. Feb. \n23, 2018). \nThe 2014 DNI Memo confirms that DOHA\u2019s administrative judges retain significant \nlatitude and discretion when evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability to hold a security clearance. In \nterms of possible mitigation of drug use, each case is fact-specific and, \"[a]s always, adjudicative \nauthorities are expected to evaluate claimed or developed use of, or involvement with, marijuana \nusing the current adjudicative criteria.\" The DNI Memo is deferential to the adjudicative process, \nstating that the \"adjudicative authority must determine if the use of, or involvement with, marijuana \nraises questions about the individual's judgment, reliability, trustworthiness, and willingness to \ncomply with law, rules, and regulations, including federal laws, when making eligibility decisions \nof persons proposed for, or occupying, national security positions.\" \nAs the Appeal Board has previously stated, after applying for a security clearance and being \nadequately placed on notice that such conduct was inconsistent with holding a security clearance, \nan applicant who continues to use marijuana demonstrates a disregard for security clearance \neligibility standards, and such behavior raises substantial questions about the applicant\u2019s judgment, \nreliability, and willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations.

Also, the Judge \nheld that Applicant\u2019s use of marijuana \u201cafter committing to abstinence in 2021 violated his \nabstinence commitment and raises continuing concerns about his trustworthiness, reliability, and \njudgment.\u201d Id. Upon our review, the Judge\u2019s findings are supported by substantial evidence of \nrecord, that is, \u201csuch relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support \na conclusion in light of all the contrary evidence in the same record.\u201d Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1. \nFinally, with regard to Applicant\u2019s plea for reconsideration, we note that an applicant\u2019s \ndisagreement with the Judge\u2019s weighing of the evidence, or an ability to argue for a different \ninterpretation of the evidence, is not sufficient to demonstrate that the Judge weighed the evidence \nor reached conclusions in a manner that is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law. E.g., ISCR \nCase No. 06-17409 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct. 12, 2007). \nApplicant has not established that the Judge committed harmful error.

On December 20, 2023, DoD issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) advising \nApplicant of the basis of that decision \u2014trustworthiness concerns raised under Guideline F \n(Financial Considerations) of the National Security Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) in Appendix A \nof Security Executive Agent Directive 4 (effective June 8, 2017) and DoD Directive 5220.6 (Jan. \n2, 1992, as amended) (Directive). Applicant elected a decision based on the written record. On \nJuly 29, 2024, Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals Administrative Judge Phillip J. Katauskas \ndenied Applicant\u2019s request for a trustworthiness designation. Applicant appealed pursuant to \nDirective \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30. \nThe SOR alleged two delinquent consumer debts, one for approximately $29,700 (SOR \u00b6 \n1.a) and the other for approximately $39,100 (SOR \u00b6 1.b). The Judge found against Applicant on \nSOR \u00b6 1.b and for her on SOR \u00b6 1.a. The favorable finding is not in issue on appeal.

Our review of the record confirms that Applicant established a payment plan in \nNovember 2022 and that she reduced the debt to approximately $34,100 by December 2023. \nHowever, as Department Counsel highlighted in the file of relevant material (FORM), the \nGovernment\u2019s evidence indicated that Applicant stopped making monthly payments in December \n2023. Prior to the FORM being submitted to the Judge, Applicant was provided a copy and the \nopportunity to submit additional material for the Judge\u2019s consideration. She failed, however, to \nsubmit any matters in response.

Mendez, Esq., Chief Department Counsel \nFOR APPLICANT \nSamir Nakhleh, Esq. \nThe Department of Defense (DoD) declined to grant Applicant a security clearance. On \nNovember 14, 2023, DoD issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the basis for \nthat decision \u2013 security concerns raised under Guideline H (Drug Involvement) of the National \nSecurity Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) of Security Executive Agent Directive 4 (effective June 8, \n2017) (SEAD 4) and DoD Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive). Applicant \nrequested a hearing which was held on May 6, 2024. On June 28, 2024, Defense Office of Hearings \nand Appeals Administrative Judge Eric H. Borgstrom concluded that it is not clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant Applicant\u2019s security clearance eligibility. Applicant appealed \npursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30. \nThe SOR\u2019s two allegations under Guidelines H alleged that Applicant had used marijuana \non various occasions between December 2021 and December 2022, including while having been \ngranted access to classified information. In his response to the SOR, Applicant admitted the \nallegations and provided amplifying information. The Administrative Judge found against \nApplicant on both allegations. \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nOn appeal, Applicant does not challenge the Judge\u2019s factual findings, but rather argues that \nthe Judge did not appropriately weigh the facts relative to the mitigating conditions. However, the \nJudge adequately addressed Applicant\u2019s circumstances in his decision and reasonably concluded \nthat Applicant\u2019s drug use while having access to classified information was unmitigated despite \nhis cessation 17 months prior to the hearing. \nApplicant also argues that he should retain his current eligibility for access to secret-level \ninformation even if the Judge\u2019s decision is affirmed. However, the level of clearance currently \nheld or applied for does not affect the Judge\u2019s analysis or the Board\u2019s review. Directive \u00b6 3.2 makes \nno distinction concerning basic clearance levels in its procedures for deciding whether access to \nclassified information is clearly in the national interest. See ISCR Case No. 05-11366 at 3 (App. \nBd. Jan. 12, 2007). Possession of a previously granted clearance does not give rise to any right or \nvested interest, nor does any favorable clearance decision preclude the Government from \nreassessing a person's security eligibility in light of current circumstances. ISCR Case No. 03\u00ad\n24144 at 6 (App. Bd. Dec. 6, 2005). Additionally, Applicant cites to language in Appendix C of \nthe SEAD 4, apparently asserting that he should be granted a waiver despite the unmitigated \ndisqualifying security concerns. A waiver was not sought at the hearing and nothing in the record \nsupports a conclusion that the Judge erred in not granting one. See ISCR Case No. 23-00521 at 6 \n(App. Bd. Apr. 11, 2024). Finally, Applicant cites to SEAD 4 and suggests that he be allowed to \n\u201ckeep working with access to classified information with various conditions or security measures.\u201d \nAgain, a conditional clearance was not sought at the hearing and nothing in the record supports a \nconclusion that the Judge erred in not granting one. Although Appendix C to SEAD 4 provides \nauthority to grant conditional clearance eligibility, we decline to do so in this instance. \nIn essence, Applicant is advocating for an alternative weighing of the evidence. An \napplicant\u2019s disagreement with the judge\u2019s weighing of the evidence or an ability to argue for a \ndifferent interpretation of the evidence is not sufficient to demonstrate that the judge weighed the \nevidence or reached conclusions in a manner that is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law. E.g., \nISCR Case No. 06-17409 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct. 12, 2007). Moreover, Applicant\u2019s arguments fail to \nrebut the presumption that the Judge considered all of the record evidence. The mere presence of \nsome favorable or mitigating evidence does not require the Judge to make an overall favorable \ndetermination in the face of disqualifying conduct such as Applicant\u2019s. See ISCR Case No. 04\u00ad\n08975 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2006). \nWe have considered the entirety of the arguments contained in Applicant\u2019s appeal brief. \nThe record supports a conclusion that the Judge examined the relevant evidence and articulated a \nsatisfactory explanation for the decision, \u201cincluding a \u2018rational connection between the facts found \nand the choice made.\u201d Motor Vehicle Mfrs.

Consistent with the following, we \naffirm. \nJudge\u2019s Findings of Fact and Analysis \nApplicant is in his mid-twenties and has been employed by a defense contractor since \nMarch 2020. He earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in mechanical engineering in 2019. He is unmarried \nand has no children. He was previously granted access to classified information in January 2021 \nafter signing a non-disclosure agreement in March 2020. He used marijuana with varying \nfrequency from about February 2021 to May 2022. He assured that, since the submission of his \nsecurity clearance application (SCA) in November 2022,1 he has not used marijuana. Decision at \n2. In an updated personal subject interview (PSI) in May 2023, Applicant assured that he no longer \nassociates with the friends with whom he used illegal drugs. Applicant was granted a security \nclearance in January 2021 and signed a non-disclosure agreement (NDA) in March 2020. His use \nof marijuana and ecstasy after being granted access to classified information and signing the NDA \nviolated the commitment he made to avoid involvement with illegal drugs while holding a security \nclearance. \nApplicant pledged to abstain from purchasing cannabis products and stated his willingness \nto sign a statement of intent to abstain from all illegal drugs, to avoid all contact with friends who \nuse drugs, to attend re-education and drug treatment programs, to be evaluated by a mental health \nprofessional, and to take better care of himself without illegal drugs. The Judge noted that \u201cwhile \nencouraging, commitments made to avoid illegal drugs while holding a security clearance cannot \nbe discounted or relaxed absent either exigent circumstance or credible independent evidence, \nwhich are not present in Applicant\u2019s case.\u201d Id. at 3. \nTo his credit, Applicant has committed to abandoning all involvement with marijuana and \necstasy and all illegal drugs. He is credited with remaining abstinent for over 18 months and \nexhibits no visible signs of indications of succumbing to any risks or pressures he might encounter \nto return to illegal drug use in the foreseeable future. His assurances of sustained abstinence from \nmarijuana and ecstasy and avoidance of associations with friends with whom he shared illegal \ndrugs are encouraging and warrant limited application of mitigating conditions. However, his \nrecent use of marijuana and ecstasy while granted access to classified information makes it too \nsoon to absolve him of risks of recurrence. Without more time and evidence from corroborating \nsources to establish a probative pattern of sustained abstinence, none of the mitigating conditions \nfully apply. Among Applicant\u2019s commitments when approved for a security clearance is his \npromise to avoid involvement with illegal drugs. It is this commitment to abstinence that Applicant \nbreached when he resumed his illegal drug use. \nDiscussion \nOn appeal, Applicant\u2019s counsel argues the Judge failed to consider all available evidence \nand failed to properly apply the mitigating conditions, in particular, the positive steps Applicant \nhas taken to ensure the security concerns were mitigated. Additionally, he argues that the Judge\u2019s \n1 The Decision mistakenly cites to November \u201c2020\u201d rather than November \u201c2022\u201d as supported by the evidence. \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \nfinding regarding Applicant\u2019s period of abstinence and disassociation from the friends with whom \nhe shared illegal drugs was incongruent and contrary to his conclusion that more time and evidence \nwas needed from corroborating sources to establish a probative pattern of sustained abstinence \nfrom illegal drugs.

Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988).  \n\u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security eligibility will be resolved \nin favor of the national security.\u201d Directive, Encl 2, App. A \u00b6 2(b).  \nIn deciding whether the Judge\u2019s rulings or conclusions are erroneous, we will review the \nJudge\u2019s decision to determine whether: it does not examine relevant evidence; it fails to articulate \na satisfactory explanation for its conclusions, including a rational connection between the facts \nfound and the choice made; it does not consider relevant factors; it reflects a clear error of \njudgment; it fails to consider an important aspect of the case; it offers an explanation for the \ndecision that runs contrary to the record evidence; or it is so implausible that it cannot be ascribed \nto a mere difference of opinion. E.g., ISCR Case No. 14-02563 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Aug. 28, 2015). \nHere, Applicant was granted a secret security clearance in January 2021 and is seeking to \nupgrade to a top-secret clearance. Applicant\u2019s post-FORM submission - Item 7. In his appeal, \nApplicant does not contest the Judge\u2019s conclusions with regard to his use of illegal drugs while \ngranted access to classified information, rather he takes issue with the conclusion that insufficient \ntime has passed to warrant mitigating credit for his period of abstinence and asserts that \nApplicant\u2019s proposed efforts at mitigation were not considered. \nRegarding the passage of time since Applicant\u2019s last involvement illegal drugs, the Judge \nfound that \u201cApplicant\u2019s recent use of marijuana and ecstasy while granted access to classified \ninformation makes it too soon to absolve him of risks of recurrence.\u201d Decision at 6. Also, the \nJudge\u2019s conclusion that more time and evidence is needed to \u201cestablish a probative pattern of \nsustained abstinence\u201d is consistent with his finding that mitigating conditions AG \u00b6\u00b6 26(a) and (b)2 \nwere not fully applicable. Id. The Directive does not define \u201crecent,\u201d and the Board has declined \nto adopt any \u201cbright-line\u201d definition for what constitutes \u201crecent\u201d conduct. Rather, the Board has \n2 AG \u00b6 26 (a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened under such circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur or does not cast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment. AG \n\u00b626 (b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and substance misuse, provides evidence of actions \ntaken to overcome this problem, and has established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not limited to: (1) \ndisassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; (2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were \nused; and (3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug involvement and substance misuse, \nacknowledging that any future involvement or misuse is grounds for revocation of national security eligibility; (c) \nabuse of prescription drugs was after a severe or prolonged illness during which these drugs were prescribed, and \nabuse has since ended; and (d) satisfactory completion of a prescribed drug treatment program, including, but not \nlimited to, rehabilitation and aftercare requirements, without recurrence of abuse, and a favorable prognosis by a duly \nqualified medical professional. \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nindicated the matter requires an Administrative Judge to evaluate the record evidence as a whole \nand reach a reasonable conclusion as to the recency of an applicant\u2019s conduct. E.g. ISCR Case No. \n11-12165 at 4 (App. Bd. Jan. 29, 2014). Upon our review, the Judge\u2019s findings are supported by \nsubstantial evidence of record, that is, \u201csuch relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept \nas adequate to support a conclusion in light of all the contrary evidence in the same record.\u201d \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.32.1. The Judge acknowledged Applicant\u2019s pledges in his post-FORM \nsubmission and found them to be \u201cencouraging,\u201d however he held that such commitments under \nthese circumstances required credible, independent evidence that was not presented by Applicant. \nApplicant\u2019s remaining assertions amount to a disagreement with the Judge\u2019s weighing of \nthe evidence. We have noted that such a disagreement or an ability to argue for a different \ninterpretation of the evidence is not sufficient to demonstrate that the Judge weighed the evidence \nor reached conclusions in a manner that is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law. E.g., ISCR \nCase No. 06-17409 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct. 12, 2007). As the Appeal Board has previously stated, after \napplying for a security clearance and being adequately placed on notice that such conduct was \ninconsistent with holding a security clearance, an applicant who continues to use marijuana \ndemonstrates a disregard for security clearance eligibility standards, and such behavior raises \nsubstantial questions about the applicant\u2019s judgment, reliability, and willingness to comply with \nlaws, rules, and regulations. ISCR Case No. 21-02534 at 4 (App. Bd. Feb. 13, 2023). \nApplicant has not established that the Judge committed harmful error.

Mendez, Esq., Chief Department Counsel \nFOR APPLICANT \nPro se \nThe Department of Defense (DoD) declined to grant Applicant a security clearance. On \nOctober 5, 2023, DoD issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the basis of that \ndecision \u2013 security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) of the National \nSecurity Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) in Appendix A of Security Executive Agent Directive 4 \n(effective June 8, 2017) and DoD Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive). \nApplicant elected to receive a decision based on the written record, without a hearing. On February \n28, 2024, Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals Administrative Judge Roger C. Wesley denied \nApplicant\u2019s security clearance eligibility. Applicant appealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and \nE3.1.30. \nThe SOR alleged that Applicant has nine delinquent debts totaling about $42,000. The \nJudge found in Applicant\u2019s favor on two debts, and against him on the remaining debts. In his \nappeal brief, Applicant points out factual errors in the Judge\u2019s decision, asserts that the Judge failed \nto consider relevant evidence, and submits new evidence. Consistent with the following, we affirm. \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nJudge\u2019s Findings of Fact and Analysis \nApplicant is in his mid-30s and has been employed by a defense contractor as a systems \nserver engineer since December 2021. He married in 2013 and divorced in 2020. He has one child \nfrom this marriage. He graduated from high school in 2008. He has held a security clearance since \n2012. \nBetween 2018 and 2022, Applicant accumulated nine delinquent accounts exceeding \n$42,000. He attributed his debts to immaturity and the availability of excessive credit. He engaged \na credit repair service who has helped him with creditor payoffs and removals of debts from his \ncredit report with disputes. Applicant was able to document a debt payoff, a settlement offer, and \nduplicate SOR allegations, but his submissions contain no documentation showing his satisfaction \nof the remaining debts. Deletion of accounts from a credit report does not equate to proof that the \ndebts were resolved by means of voluntary, good-faith payments or other agreed settlement \narrangement between the parties. \nThe Judge held that without any documented evidence of Applicant\u2019s resolution of the bulk \nof his debts with payoffs and payment plans, except in two cases, or good cause demonstrated for \nwhy debts have not been resolved, no mitigating condition applies. Applicant\u2019s expressed \ncommitments to address his still outstanding accounts with promised payments represent no more \nthan promises to resolve his still outstanding debts and are not viable substitutes for a track record \nof paying debts in a timely manner and otherwise acting in a responsible way. \nDiscussion \nIn his appeal brief, Applicant claims that the Judge erred in certain factual findings with \nregard to his background, argues for reconsideration of certain efforts he has made to resolve debts, \nand includes additional evidence showing the current status of some debts. \nIn deciding whether the Judge's rulings or conclusions are erroneous, we will review the \ndecision to determine whether: it does not examine relevant evidence; it fails to articulate a \nsatisfactory explanation for its conclusions, including a rational connection between the facts \nfound and the choice made; it does not consider relevant factors; it reflects a clear error of \njudgment; it fails to consider an important aspect of the case; it offers an explanation for the \ndecision that runs contrary to the record evidence; or it is so implausible that it cannot be ascribed \nto a mere difference of opinion. ISCR Case No. 97-0435 at 3 (App. Bd. Jul. 14, 1998). \nWe agree that the Judge made factual errors in describing Applicant\u2019s background, \nincluding his age, marital status, and current position held. The Judge\u2019s confusion regarding certain \nbackground information, however, constitutes harmless error because it does not likely affect the \noutcome of the case. ISCR Case No. 19-01431 at 4 (App. Bd. Mar. 31, 2020). \nApplicant next asserts the Judge erred by not giving a settlement offer letter appropriate \nweight, and that more time was needed to show progress in settlement of this and other accounts. \nHe argues that evidence of certain debt resolution efforts was not available when he responded to \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nthe Government\u2019s File of Relevant Material (FORM). Applicant offers new evidence in support of \nhis assertions. \nIn part, Applicant is advocating for an alternative weighing of the evidence. Disagreement \nwith the Judge\u2019s weighing of the evidence or an ability to argue for a different interpretation of the \nevidence is not sufficient to conclude that the Judge weighed the evidence or reached conclusions \nin a manner that is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law. E.g., ISCR Case No. 06-17409 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Oct. 12, 2007). Applicant has not established that the Judge committed harmful error. \nOur review of the record reflects that the Judge examined the relevant evidence and articulated a \nsatisfactory explanation for the decision, which is sustainable on this record. \nWe have often stated that a security clearance adjudication is not a proceeding aimed at \ncollecting an applicant\u2019s debts. Rather, it is a proceeding aimed at evaluating an applicant\u2019s \njudgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. E.g., ISCR Case No. 07-08049 at 5 (App. Bd. Jul. 22, \n2008). The scope of Guideline F encompasses not only an Applicant\u2019s current financial situation, \nbut also extends to his or her financial history. As a general rule, an applicant is not required to be \ndebt-free nor to develop a plan for paying off all debts immediately or simultaneously. E.g., ISCR \nCase No. 09-08462 at 4 (App. Bd. May 31, 2011). However, an applicant must act responsibly \ngiven his or her circumstances and develop a reasonable plan for repayment, accompanied by \nconcomitant conduct even if it may only provide for the payment of debts one at a time. ISCR \nCase No. 07-06482 at 3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008). \nThe Appeal Board has held that \u201cit is reasonable for a Judge to expect applicants to present \ndocumentation about the satisfaction of specific debts.\u201d ISCR Case No. 09-07091 at 2 (App. Bd. \nAug. 11, 2010). Moreover, intentions to resolve financial problems in the future are not a substitute \nfor a track record of debt repayment or other responsible approaches. E.g., ISCR Case No. 11\u00ad\n14570 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct. 23, 2013). An applicant who waits until his clearance is in jeopardy \nbefore resolving debts may be lacking in the judgment and self-discipline expected of those with \naccess to classified information. E.g., ISCR Case No. 16-01211 at 4 (App. Bd. May 30, 2018). \nFinally, with regard to additional or clarifying evidence presented on appeal, the Appeal Board is \nprohibited from considering new evidence on appeal and does not review cases de novo. Directive \n\u00b6 E3.1.29. \nApplicant has not established that the Judge committed harmful error. Our review of the \nrecord reflects that the Judge examined the relevant evidence and articulated a satisfactory \nexplanation for the decision, which is sustainable on this record. \u201cThe general standard is that a \nclearance may be granted only when \u2018clearly consistent with the interests of the national security.\u2019\u201d \nDepartment of the Navy v.

On July 18, 2024, Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals Administrative Judge \nLeRoy F. Foreman denied Applicant\u2019s security clearance eligibility. Applicant appealed pursuant \nto Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30. \nUnder Guideline F, the SOR alleged eight delinquent consumer debts and a Chapter 13 \nbankruptcy. In his answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted all allegations with explanations and \nelected a decision based on the written record. In February 2024, Department Counsel mailed a \ncomplete copy of the file of relevant material (FORM) to Applicant and provided him an \nopportunity to file objections and submit material to refute, extenuate, or mitigate the \nGovernment\u2019s evidence.

Mendez, Esq., Chief Department Counsel \nFOR APPLICANT \nPro se \nThe Department of Defense (DoD) declined to grant Applicant a security clearance. On \nNovember 9, 2023, DoD issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the basis of \nthat decision \u2013 security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) of the \nNational Security Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) in Appendix A of Security Executive Agent \nDirective 4 (effective June 8, 2017) and DoD Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) \n(Directive). On May 28, 2024, after conducting a hearing, Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals \nAdministrative Judge John Bayard Glendon denied Applicant\u2019s security clearance eligibility. \nApplicant appealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30. \nThe SOR alleges 13 financial concerns, and the Judge found against Applicant as to all but \ntwo of the allegations. On appeal, Applicant notes that the Judge found that Applicant \u201cwas not \nable to make payments from 2019 to 2020.\u201d He further states that he \u201cwas still making all payment \nuntil 2020 pandemic covid started.\u201d While not specifically articulated, this implies that the Judge \nmade a factual error regarding when Applicant\u2019s delinquencies began. \nAlthough Applicant does not cite to a specific portion of the Decision, it appears he is \nreferring to the following sentence: \u201cThe debts alleged in the SOR are mostly credit-card accounts \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nthat he has been unable to pay since about 2019 or 2020.\u201d Decision at 3. It is noteworthy that \ncontrary to Applicant\u2019s paraphrasing, the Judge concluded that Applicants delinquencies began \n\u201cabout 2019 or 2020.\u201d (emphasis added). Applicant himself testified that before 2020, \u201cI pretty \nmuch had a clean record with all my finances.\u201d Transcript at 20. Thus, there is some ambiguity as \nto when Applicant\u2019s financial problems began. Regardless, we do not evaluate a Judge's decision \nbased on isolated words or sentences but, rather, on the decision viewed as a whole. ISCR Case \nNo. 20-00204 at 4 (App. Bd. Feb. 2, 2022). Considering the totality of the facts of this case, it is \nof no significant consequence whether the delinquencies began in 2019 or 2020. Therefore, to the \nextent there may be error, it is harmless as it did not likely affect the outcome of the case. E.g., \nISCR Case No. 95-0495 at 4 (App. Bd. Mar. 22, 1996). \nApplicant makes no other claims that can be interpreted as an assertion of error. The Appeal \nBoard does not review cases de novo. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.29. The Board\u2019s authority to review a case \nis limited to cases in which the appealing party has alleged the judge committed harmful error. We \nhave considered the entirety of Applicant\u2019s arguments. The record supports a conclusion that the Judge \nexamined the relevant data and articulated a satisfactory explanation for the decision, \u201cincluding a \n\u2018rational connection between the facts found and the choice made.\u2019\u201d Motor Vehicle Mfrs.

Corrales, Esq., Deputy Chief Department Counsel \nFOR APPLICANT \nPro se \nThe Department of Defense (DoD) declined to grant Applicant a security clearance. On \nNovember 13, 2023, DoD issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the basis of \nthat decision \u2013 security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) of the \nNational Security Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) in Appendix A of Security Executive Agent \nDirective 4 (effective June 8, 2017) and DoD Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) \n(Directive). Applicant elected a decision based on the written record. The Government submitted \na File of Relevant Material (FORM) containing the entire record and the Government\u2019s argument. \nApplicant was provided an opportunity to respond. His response to the FORM was admitted into the \nrecord. On May 15, 2024, Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) Administrative Judge \nCarol G. Ricciardello denied Applicant\u2019s security clearance eligibility. Applicant appealed \npursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30. Department Counsel filed a reply brief. \nUnder Guideline F, the SOR alleged that Applicant had two delinquent credit card debts \ntotaling nearly $20,000 and that Applicant failed to timely file Federal income tax returns for tax \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nyears 2020, 2021, and 2022. Applicant admitted all of the SOR allegations with explanations. The \nJudge found in Applicant\u2019s favor on the tax allegations and against him on the two delinquent debt \nallegations. On appeal, Applicant asserts that the Judge erred by not convening a hearing when \nApplicant had expressed a willingness to attend one and failed to consider all of the evidence in \nmitigation. Consistent with the following, we affirm. \nJudge\u2019s Findings of Fact and Analysis \nApplicant is in his late 30s. He earned a bachelor\u2019s and master\u2019s degrees and honorably \nserved in the military from 2003 to 2015. He married in 2004 and divorced in 2006, and he has an \n18 year old child. Applicant mitigated the tax allegations. With regard to the two delinquent debts \nalleged in the SOR, Applicant admitted both, and said he faithfully paid the accounts for ten years. \nIn 2016, after separating from the military, Applicant defaulted on the debts, which were charged \noff and placed for collection. He argued that he had no creditor to pay for the charged-off debt and \ndid not provide any evidence of efforts he may have made in the past seven years to resolve the \ndebt with the original creditor. The other debt was sent to a collection agency in 2022, and \nApplicant did not provide evidence of efforts to resolve it from 2016 to 2022. He said the collection \nagent offered a settlement, but Applicant wanted a written promise from the agency that it will be \nremoved from his credit report. \nThe Judge held that Applicant failed to resolve his delinquent debts, and they remain \ncurrent and overdue. She found that Applicant has not taken any significant action to resolve the \ndebts, and he did not contact the creditor on one debt, even when it was clear it was a security \nconcern. He also failed to provide an update on efforts to address the settlement offer on the other \ndebt. His answer to Government interrogatories stating that he is working to have the credit card \ndebt removed from his credit report since they are over seven years old, is an indication that he \ndoes not intend to resolve the debts themselves. The Judge noted that, \u201c[b]ecause Applicant \nrequested a determination on the record without a hearing, I had no opportunity to question him \nabout the specifics of his actions and whether he made any additional effort to resolve his \ndelinquent debts or evaluate his credibility and sincerity based on demeanor.\u201d She held that the \ndebts remain on his current credit report and Applicant has not acted responsibly. There is no \nevidence he received financial counselling or that there are clear indications the problem is being \nresolved, and no good-faith efforts were made in the past years to resolve the debts. \nDiscussion \nThe record confirms that Applicant received a copy of the FORM on February 5, 2024, and \nthat the FORM itself and the accompanying cover letter advised Applicant regarding his right to \nrespond. DOHA received Applicant\u2019s response to the FORM on February 14, 2024, which was \nsubmitted to the Judge and entered into the record. On appeal, Applicant states that in his response \nto the SOR, he wrote: \nI wish to have the Administrative Judge issue a decision based upon the response \nand documents I have provided. If the Judge decides to hold a hearing. Please note \nthat I will need to video conference into the hearing as I am outside of the United \nStates.

He also asserts that he elected a \ndecision without a hearing because he could not attend a hearing in person, and the documents sent \nto him did not give him \u201cthe best instructions as to what I should pick given my travel schedule.\u201d \nHe said the Judge \u201cmade no attempt or expressed the need for a hearing to understand and or see \nmy sincerity in my responses.\u201d Id. \nApplicant has not established that he was denied the due process afforded by the Directive. \nFirst, Applicant clearly and unequivocally elected a decision based on the written record. DOHA \npersonnel have no authority to provide advice to applicants concerning what rights they should \nexercise and should refrain from going beyond the language of the Directive and, if applicable, the \ncurrent Prehearing Guidance in their interactions with applicants. See ADP Case No. 18-00329 at \n3 (App. Bd. Dec. 14, 2018). DOHA personnel must avoid making comments that may influence \napplicants in exercising their rights under the Directive. ISCR Case No. 20-01622 at 2 (App. Bd. \nJun. 27, 2022). We find that Applicant was fully aware of his right to a hearing and knowingly \nwaived that right. A Judge is not obligated to require a hearing, nor is she obligated to require that \nApplicant respond to inquiries outside of the FORM process. If an Applicant has not requested a \nhearing with his or her answer to the SOR, and Department Counsel has not requested a hearing \nwithin 20 days of receipt of the applicant\u2019s answer, the case shall be assigned to the Administrative \nJudge for a clearance decision based on the written record. Directive E3.1.7. The Judge is an \nadvocate for neither side and bases her decision on the evidence presented to her by the parties. \nSee ISCR Case No. 12-10335 at 4 (App. Bd. Dec. 29, 2017). \nNext, after requesting a decision on the written record, Applicant received a copy of \nDepartment Counsel\u2019s File of Relevant Material (FORM) and was given an opportunity to respond \nto the FORM and submit additional matters for the Judge to consider. He submitted a response to \nthe FORM that included additional documentary evidence. Considering all the circumstances, the \nBoard concludes Applicant knowingly waived his right to a hearing and received a reasonable \nopportunity to respond to the FORM, including the option to present additional evidence for \nconsideration in his case. Absent a showing of factual or legal error that affects a party\u2019s right to \npresent evidence in the proceeding below, a party does not have the right to have a second chance \nat presenting his or her case before an administrative judge. See ISCR Case No. 14-02730 at 2 \n(App. Bd. Jun. 24, 2016). \nFinally, the remainder of Applicant\u2019s brief amounts to a disagreement with the Judge\u2019s \nweighing of the evidence. None of his arguments, however, are sufficient to establish the Judge \nweighed the evidence in a manner that was arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law. Directive \u00b6 \nE3.1.32.3. We have often stated that a security clearance adjudication is not a proceeding aimed \nat collecting an applicant\u2019s debts. Rather, it is a proceeding aimed at evaluating an applicant\u2019s \njudgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. E.g., ISCR Case No. 07-08049 at 5 (App. Bd. Jul. 22, \n2008). The scope of Guideline F encompasses not only an Applicant\u2019s current financial situation, \nbut also extends to his or her financial history. As a general rule, an applicant is not required to be \ndebt-free nor to develop a plan for paying off all debts immediately or simultaneously. E.g., ISCR \nCase No. 09-08462 at 4 (App. Bd. May 31, 2011). However, an applicant must act responsibly \ngiven his or her circumstances and develop a reasonable plan for repayment, accompanied by \nconcomitant conduct even if it may only provide for the payment of debts one at a time. ISCR \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nCase No. 07-06482 at 3 (App. Bd.

Mendez, Esq., Chief Department Counsel \nFOR APPLICANT \nPro se \nThe Department of Defense (DoD) declined to grant Applicant a security clearance. On \nDecember 1, 2023, DoD issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the basis of \nthat decision \u2013 security concerns raised under Guidelines E (Personal Conduct) and F (Financial \nConcerns) of the National Security Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) in Appendix A of Security \nExecutive Agent Directive 4 (effective June 8, 2017) and DoD Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as \namended) (Directive). Applicant requested a decision based on the written record, without a \nhearing. The Government provided Applicant with the File of Relevant Material (FORM) \ncontaining the entire record and the Government\u2019s argument. Applicant did not file a response to \nthe FORM and on July 25, 2024, Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals Administrative Judge \nCarol G. Ricciardello denied Applicant\u2019s security clearance eligibility. Applicant appealed \npursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30. \nOn appeal, Applicant correctly asserts that the Judge erred when she found that his age was \n48, rather than 46. This error was harmless, as it did not likely affect the outcome of the case. See, \ne.g., ISCR Case No. 95-0495 at 4 (App. Bd. Mar. 22, 1996) (remand or reversal required only \nwhere there is a significant chance that, but for the error, a different result might have been \nreached).

Mendez, Esq., Chief Department Counsel \nFOR APPLICANT \nJohn Cannon, Esq. \nThe Department of Defense (DoD) declined to grant Applicant a security clearance. On \nDecember 11, 2023, DoD issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the basis of \nthat decision \u2013 security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) of the \nNational Security Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) in Appendix A of Security Executive Agent \nDirective 4 (effective June 8, 2017) and DoD Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) \n(Directive). On July 18, 2024, after conducting a hearing, Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals \nAdministrative Judge Edward W. Loughran denied Applicant\u2019s security clearance eligibility. \nApplicant appealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30. \nThe SOR alleged five financial concerns, and the Judge found against Applicant as to all \nfive. On appeal, Applicant argues that the Judge\u2019s decision is arbitrary and capricious.

A military veteran, she was honorably discharged in 2007 \nand receives disability pay of about $4,100 for post-traumatic stress disorder. She earned a \nbachelor\u2019s degree in 2020 and is pursuing a master\u2019s degree. Her first two marriages ended in \ndivorce. Applicant is separated from her third husband, a military servicemember whom she \nmarried in 2016. They had one child early in the marriage and decided that they would have two \nmore and that she would homeschool the children. Applicant\u2019s VA disability rating was about 70% \nat the time, and their plan did not allow them to pay their accumulated debts. They decided instead \nto pay only her husband\u2019s debts, as he needed a security clearance and she did not.  \nThe SOR alleges five delinquent debts totaling about $31,300. Applicant admitted all the \ndebts in her answer to the SOR but stated that the debts either fell off her credit report because of \nage or would shortly fall off the report. Three charged-off debts totaling about $17,100 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 \n1.b, 1.d, and 1.e) are owed to the same credit union. The $11,515 charged-off debt alleged in SOR \n\u00b6 1.c was used to fund a business venture that failed, and the debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.a was a credit \ncard debt. Applicant has not paid any of the SOR debts and does not intend to. Although some of \nthe collection companies agreed to settle the debts for as low as 10%, the debts are past the statute \nof limitations and paying or settling any of the debts would restart the seven-year reporting period \nand harm her credit score. Her April 2024 credit report does not reflect any of the alleged debts. \nApplicant and her husband separated in about 2023 and she anticipates they will divorce. \nAlthough he is still on active duty, he does not pay child support. She did not actively pursue him \nfor child support because he had accused her of being a \u201cgold-digger.\u201d She plans to retain her \nattorney for the purpose of seeking child support for her child. In the past seven years, Applicant \nhas incurred no new delinquent debts. She has not pursued financial counseling. She and her \nhusband purchased a new vehicle in about June 2022, financed through a loan of about $53,600. \nWithin a year, she traded it in for a larger vehicle, for which she pays about $800 per month. \nApplicant has a history of delinquent debts and financial problems. Although Applicant\u2019s \ndecision to be a stay-at-home mother is understandable, it was not beyond her control. The couple\u2019s \ndecision to sacrifice Applicant\u2019s finances to help her husband maintain a security clearance worked \nfor her until they separated, she decided to reenter the workforce, and she realized that a security \nclearance would also be beneficial to her. \nApplicant has not paid any of the SOR debts, and she does not intend to, as \nshe waited for them to age off her credit report. The fact that a debt no longer \nappears on a credit report does not establish any meaningful, independent evidence \nas to the disposition of the debt. Little mitigation is provided in security clearance \ncases when an applicant stands on a legal defense such as the statute of limitations. \nThe SOR debts are at least seven years old, and Applicant has not accrued \nany additional debts. Had she been more concerned with paying her legal \nobligations than maintaining a good credit score, this decision could have gone in \nher favor. \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant did not act responsibly under the circumstances, and she did not \nmake a good-faith effort to pay her debts. Her financial issues are recent. They \ncontinue to cast doubt on her current reliability, trustworthiness, and good \njudgment. [Decision at 5 (internal citations omitted).] \nDiscussion \nOn appeal, Applicant argues that the Judge\u2019s decision is arbitrary and capricious. Although \nApplicant does not cite to any specific errors by the Judge, she argues broadly that the Judge failed \nto consider the context in which these debts arose, to include: that Applicant was in an abusive \nmarriage; that she acceded to her husband\u2019s demands that she not work outside the home; and that \n\u201c[u]pon breaking free from her abusive marriage, [Applicant] identified a game plan to address the \ndelinquent marital debts that were in her name alone\u201d but received financial advice that \u201cdue to \nthe age of the debts it would be better for her to allow them to age out, thereby falling off her credit \nscore, than to pay a settlement on each of the debts.\u201d Appeal Brief at 5. Applicant notes that this \n\u201cwas accurate financial advice\u201d as the debts have since fallen off. Id. at 2. She argues, however, \nthat she \u201cwould have settled these debts, as she testified was an option and was referenced in Judge \nLoughran\u2019s Decision; had she known it would result in her being denied a security clearance.\u201d Id. \nat 3. In a personal statement attached to the appeal brief, Applicant highlights the legal and \nfinancial risks of now making payments on these debts and questions whether it is a reasonable \nexpectation that she \u201copen myself up to potential financial lawsuits in order to get a clearance.\u201d \nPersonal Statement at 3. \nThese arguments are misplaced. We have often stated that a security clearance adjudication \nis not a proceeding aimed at collecting an applicant\u2019s debts. Rather, it is a proceeding aimed at \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness, and the Government is entitled \nto consider the facts and circumstances surrounding an applicant\u2019s conduct in incurring the debt \nand failing to satisfy it in a timely manner. E.g., ISCR Case No. 07-08049 at 5 (App. Bd. Jul. 22, \n2008). The Judge\u2019s conclusion that Applicant did not act responsibly under the circumstances is \nadequately supported by the record. His analysis of her decision to allow the statute of limitations \nto run is well-rooted in the Appeal Board precedent to which he cites. Fundamentally, Applicant \nis requesting reconsideration of the Judge\u2019s decision and, to that end, she provides additional \ndetails about the circumstances that led to the alleged debts and about her current personal, \nprofessional, and financial situation. The Appeal Board does not review cases de novo and is \nprohibited from considering new evidence on appeal. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.29. \nWe have considered all of Applicant\u2019s arguments and conclude that none is sufficient to \nrebut the presumption that the Judge considered all of the evidence in the record, nor are they \nenough to show that the Judge weighed the evidence in a manner that was arbitrary, capricious, or \ncontrary to law. The record supports a conclusion that the Judge examined the relevant data and \narticulated a satisfactory explanation for the decision, \u201cincluding a \u2018rational connection between \nthe facts found and the choice made.\u2019\u201d Motor Vehicle Mfrs.

The Judge found against Applicant on all allegations, noting that, while her delinquent \ndebts were accumulated due largely to circumstances beyond her control, she had neither taken \naction to address the debts nor shown that they were resolved or in the process of being resolved. \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThere is no presumption of error below and the appealing party has the burden of \ndemonstrating that the judge committed factual or legal error.

Directive \u00b6 E3.1.29. \nThe Judge\u2019s decision does not address any statute of limitations issues, as Applicant raises \nthe issue for the first time on appeal. The Appeal Board, however, has consistently held that debts \nremain relevant for security clearance purposes even if they are no longer enforceable due to the \nrunning of the statute of limitations and that reliance on a state\u2019s statute of limitations does not \nconstitute a good-faith effort to resolve financial difficulties. E.g., ISCR Case No. 20-01618 at 3 \n(App. Bd.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant disclosed a history of mental health treatment, beginning from when she was prescribed anti\u00addepressant medication as a teenager after her brother was killed in a car accident. In about 2002, Applicant saw a therapist for depression after she lost her job and was prescribed anti-depressant medication, but she later terminated the relationship and medication after she felt better. Applicant stated that she has experienced depression at times in her life but asserted that she was never depressed without a valid reason, such as death of a loved one or job loss. She has never been hospitalized, and she asserted that she has never had a manic episode and that no one has ever expressed concern that she was manic or unstable. Following a job loss in about 2011, Applicant was depressed and sought treatment with medication through a psychiatrist, Dr. L. Applicant met with Dr. L on about a monthly basis for the first year while they identified an appropriate combination of medications, and they later met quarterly for medication management. Dr. L prescribed anti-depressant Wellbutrin and mood stabilizer Lamictal, as well as anti-anxiety medications Klonopin and Buspar for use as needed. 1 In our Remand Order, we noted, \u201c[t]he Judge may sua sponte or upon motion of either party reopen the record to better address the identified issues.\u201d Remand Order at 8.

Corrales, Esq., Deputy Chief Department Counsel \nFOR APPLICANT \nCarl Marrone, Esq. \nThe Department of Defense (DoD) declined to grant Applicant a security clearance. On \nMarch 21, 2022, DoD issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the basis of that \ndecision \u2013 security concerns raised under Guideline G (Alcohol Consumption), Guideline J \n(Criminal Conduct), and Guideline I (Psychological Conditions) of the National Security \nAdjudicative Guidelines (AG) in Appendix A of Security Executive Agent Directive 4 (effective \nJune 8, 2017) and DoD Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive). On July 3, 2024, \nDefense Office of Hearings and Appeals Administrative Judge Ross D. Hyams granted Applicant \nnational security eligibility. The Government appealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and \nE3.1.30. \nOn its first appeal, the Government argued that the Judge mis-weighed the Guideline I \nevidence and misapplied the Guideline I disqualifying and mitigating conditions, rendering his \ndecision arbitrary, capricious, and contrary to law and the record evidence. On October 17, 2024, \nthe Board remanded the case to the Judge for clarification on his findings and conclusions.

The Government \nagain appealed. For the reasons stated below, we reverse the Remand Decision. \nJudge\u2019s Procedural Ruling \nOn November 18, 2024, the Government moved to reopen the record in the case to submit \nnew evidence and have another hearing with new witness testimony. However, the Judge found \nthat the Government\u2019s request \u201cdid not summarize the proffered testimony of the witnesses or \notherwise offer specific enough information to warrant a new hearing. The Government did not \noffer affidavits from witnesses or a new mental-health evaluation.\u201d Remand Decision at 2. As a \nresult, the Judge denied the motion for a hearing.1 \nJudge\u2019s Findings of Fact \nApplicant disclosed a history of mental health treatment, beginning from when she was \nprescribed anti\u00addepressant medication as a teenager after her brother was killed in a car accident. \nIn about 2002, Applicant saw a therapist for depression after she lost her job and was prescribed \nanti-depressant medication, but she later terminated the relationship and medication after she felt \nbetter. Applicant stated that she has experienced depression at times in her life but asserted that \nshe was never depressed without a valid reason, such as death of a loved one or job loss. She has \nnever been hospitalized, and she asserted that she has never had a manic episode and that no one \nhas ever expressed concern that she was manic or unstable. \nFollowing a job loss in about 2011, Applicant was depressed and sought treatment with \nmedication through a psychiatrist, Dr. L. Applicant met with Dr. L on about a monthly basis for \nthe first year while they identified an appropriate combination of medications, and they later met \nquarterly for medication management. Dr. L prescribed anti-depressant Wellbutrin and mood \nstabilizer Lamictal, as well as anti-anxiety medications Klonopin and Buspar for use as needed. \n1 In our Remand Order, we noted, \u201c[t]he Judge may sua sponte or upon motion of either party reopen the record to \nbetter address the identified issues.\u201d Remand Order at 8. On October 23, 2024, the Government inquired if the Judge \nintended to reopen the record and, if not, indicated their intention to move to do so. The Judge responded the same \nday that he would let the parties know how he planned to proceed \u201cin the next week or so.\u201d Second Appeal Brief, \nAttachment 1 at 4. Having received no response, on November 18, 2024, the Government \u201cformally request[ed] that \nthe record be re-opened in this matter for submission of new evidence and testimony.\u201d Id. On December 12, 2024, the \nJudge informed the parties that he could \u201caddress the issues raised by the Appeal Board with the current record\u201d and \ndenied the Government\u2019s request to reopen. Id. at 3. On appeal, the Government contends the Judge erred by not \nreopening the record. Whether the Judge\u2019s denial of the Government\u2019s request to reopen was error is a complicated \nmatter under the facts of this case and, considering our determination that reversal is appropriate, ultimately need not \nbe substantively addressed. The matter of reopening a record generally, however, merits brief discussion. \nThe Board has in some prior cases required a showing of good cause to reopen the record on remand, but only after \nsuch a \u201cgood cause\u201d standard had been articulated in the remanding order. See ISCR Case No. 02-12199 at 3 (App. \nBd. Aug. 8, 2005). In the instant case, the Board did not articulate a standard under which the Judge should consider \nthe Government\u2019s request to reopen, leaving the Judge\u2019s obligation to reopen ambiguously permissive. Moving \nforward, in the absence of more specific language in the Board\u2019s remand directive, a party seeking to reopen a case\u2019s \nrecord on remand should be expected to offer good cause for the judge\u2019s consideration in the request. \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \nOutside of the initial 30-minute visit, all of Applicant\u2019s appointments with Dr. L lasted for about \nfive to ten minutes. Applicant testified that Dr. L conducted no testing, gave no formal diagnosis, \nand never provided therapy or counseling. \nOver the subsequent years, Applicant requested changes to her medications and dosages to \nfind what worked best for her. In 2015, she felt the medications were not improving her quality of \nlife and, \u201cknowing that she could not just stop taking medication,\u201d she worked with Dr. L to \nsuccessfully wean off Wellbutrin. Id. at 4. Applicant resumed taking Wellbutrin for about three \nmonths after her dog died in July 2020, but she has not used the medication since that time. \nOver time, Applicant grew less satisfied with Dr. L\u2019s treatment, believing that he was \nputting insufficient effort into identifying a long-term solution, and began favoring advice and \nsupport from other medical professionals, including her primary care physician, her mother with \n40 years of experience as a registered nurse, and her best friend with 20 years of experience as a \npharmacist. Applicant consulted with her preferred care team about her rheumatoid arthritis and \nlearned that her prescribed mood stabilizer, Lamictal, could negatively interact with her arthritis \nmedication. In June 2021, Applicant told Dr. L that she was discontinuing the mood stabilizer and \nthat she would contact him if needed in the future. Applicant had no further contact with Dr. L. \nIn January 2022, about seven months after ending her relationship with Dr. L and in \nconjunction with her request for national security eligibility, Applicant was evaluated by Dr. B, a \nDoD-connected psychologist. Dr. B\u2019s final report identified that her findings and diagnosis were \nbased on Applicant\u2019s Personality Assessment Inventory, which was completed online prior to their \ninterview, the interview with Applicant, Dr. B\u2019s post-interview telephonic consult with Dr. L, and \nother unidentified \u201cavailable records.\u201d \nDr. B summarized her phone consult with Dr. L in the final report. Regarding Applicant\u2019s \ndiagnosis, Dr. L opined that Applicant was most consistent with Bipolar II disorder or a mixed \nbipolar condition, but that he was unsure of Applicant\u2019s most accurate diagnosis because he was \nfocused on treating her symptoms. Dr. L had never seen evidence of Applicant having a full manic \nepisode but observed some hypomania. Dr. B found that Applicant had diagnostic history of \nbipolar disorder and adjustment disorder with anxiety, observed signs of hypomania during the \ninterview, endorsed a current diagnosis of bipolar disorder, and concluded that Applicant\u2019s \nprognosis is poor and her judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness are likely to be impaired. \nApplicant testified that \u201cDr. B was cold, judgmental, and condescending to her\u201d during the \nevaluation, which she contended lasted 30 minutes, and that Dr. B repeatedly inquired about \nApplicant\u2019s decision to discontinue taking Lamictal and treatment with Dr. L. Remand Decision \nat 5. Applicant came to have the impression that she would be unable to keep her job without \ntaking Lamictal, and so she resumed in February 2022 under the medication management of her \nprimary care physician.  \nIn May 2022, Applicant sought a \u201cfresh evaluation and professional opinion\u201d and consulted \nwith Dr. P, a Doctor of Psychology. Id. at 10. For her evaluation with Dr. P, Applicant took the \nMinnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory 2 test (MMPI-2) and asserted that she met with Dr. \nP in person for several hours for a biopsychosocial assessment. Dr. P found that Applicant\u2019s \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \npersonality was within normal limits, diagnosed her with adjustment disorder with anxiety, and \nfound no current evidence of bipolar disorder.2 Dr. P concluded that Applicant\u2019s prognosis was \ngood, and she is reliable, stable, and trustworthy. The Judge found that \u201cDr. B\u2019s report contains \nerrors that undermine her findings\u201d and that Dr. P\u2019s report contained \u201cone error [that] does not \nundermine the findings of the report.\u201d Id. at 7, 10.3 \nMultiple witnesses testified on Applicant\u2019s behalf and opined favorably about her \nprofessionalism, reliability, and trustworthiness, and noted that they had not observed her act in an \nunstable or hypomanic way. Applicant also submitted into evidence 11 letters of reference from \nwork colleagues, which provided similar favorable opinions of her. \nDiscussion \nOn appeal, the Government argues that the Judge\u2019s Remand Decision is arbitrary and \ncapricious, as he erred: by giving insufficient weight to the DoD-contracted psychologist\u2019s report \nand too much weight to Applicant\u2019s two experts; in failing to apply disqualifying condition AG \u00b6 \n28(d); in applying mitigating conditions AG \u00b6\u00b6 29(a) and (b); and in mis-applying the Whole-\nPerson Concept. The Government also argues that the Judge was biased and failed to give the \nparties proper notice that he was taking Administrative Notice. The Government\u2019s arguments have \nmerit. \nA judge\u2019s decision can be found to be arbitrary or capricious if: \u201cit does not examine \nrelevant evidence; it fails to articulate a satisfactory explanation for its conclusions, including a \nrational connection between the facts and the choice made; [it] does not consider relevant factors; \n[it] reflects a clear error of judgment; it fails to consider an important aspect of the case; it offers \nan explanation for the decision that runs contrary to the record evidence; or [it] is so implausible \nthat it cannot be ascribed to a mere difference of opinion.\u201d ISCR Case No. 95-0600, 1996 WL \n480993 at *3 (App. Bd. May 16, 1996) (citing Motor Vehicle Mfr. Ass\u2019n v. State Farm Mut. Ins. \nCo., 463 U.S. 29, 43 (1983)). \nWhen an appeal issue raises a question of law, the Board\u2019s scope of review is plenary. See \nDISCR OSD Case No. 87-2107, 1992 WL 388439 at *3-4 (App. Bd. Sep. 29, 1992) (citations to \nfederal cases omitted). If an appealing party demonstrates factual or legal error, then the Board \nmust consider the following questions: (1) Is the error harmful or harmless?; (2) Has the \nnonappealing party made a persuasive argument for how the judge\u2019s decision can be affirmed on \nalternate grounds?; and (3) If the judge\u2019s decision cannot be affirmed, should the case be reversed \nor remanded? See ISCR Case No. 02-08032 at 2 (App. Bd. May 14, 2004). \n2 Omitted from the Judge\u2019s Remand Decision was the full context of this portion of Dr. P\u2019s diagnostic \nrecommendation: \u201cAt this time, the MMPI-2 does not indicate any specific clinical disorders. In essence, there is no \nevidence that she has a current diagnosis of Bipolar Disorder. This does not dispute the psychiatrist's diagnosis.\u201d \nApplicant Exhibit (AE) I at 2 (emphasis added). \n3 These purported errors ascribed to both mental health professionals are more accurately evidentiary conflicts and \ninconsistencies in Applicant\u2019s reporting, which are addressed more fully, below. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nOfficial Notice \nWe have long held that, under the concept of official notice, \u201cthe parties are entitled to a \nmeaningful opportunity to respond to an agency\u2019s decision to take official notice of facts that can \nbe crucial to the determination of issues before it.\u201d DISCR Case No. 90-1550 at 7 (App. Bd. Mar. \n25, 1992). Here, the Judge sua sponte took official notice of the Fifth Edition of the Diagnostic \nand Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5) and the criteria for Bipolar II disorder, \nfocusing specifically on the criterion for a Hypomanic Episode, which he then used to discredit \nDr. B\u2019s diagnostic impressions. However, the Judge did not notify either party of his decision to \ntake notice of this information or give them a meaningful opportunity to respond. This was in error. \nIt is compounded by the errors discussed below. \nGuideline I Analysis \nWe turn next to the Government\u2019s arguments about the Judge\u2019s application of the \ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions under Guideline I. The Government first argues that the \nJudge\u2019s finding that AG \u00b6 28(d)4 was not established was arbitrary, capricious, and contrary to \nlaw, and is unsupported by the totality of the record evidence. We agree. \nThe Judge\u2019s analysis under Guideline I found that Dr. B\u2019s report established AG \u00b6\u00b6 28(a)5 \nand (b),6 but that AG \u00b6 28(d) was not established. He provided no analysis for his application of \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 28(a) and (b), other than to note that these disqualifying conditions applied \u201cdespite the \nerrors and omissions\u201d in Dr. B\u2019s report. Remand Decision at 14. He did not identify the behavior \nof concern in applying AG \u00b6 28(a). However, we note that his decision to apply AG \u00b6 28(a) \ncontradicts his statement in his mitigation analysis that \u201cthere is no evidence showing that \nApplicant has been erratic, unreliable, untrustworthy, had incidents at work or with law \nenforcement, or behaved in a way that was problematic.\u201d Id. at 16. \nThe Judge then found that AG \u00b6 28(d) was not established because there were \u201cno medical \nrecords or documentation in this case showing a prescribed treatment plan that Applicant failed to \nfollow.\u201d Id. at 14. He further noted that \u201c[t]here was no evidence that Applicant failed to take \nprescribed medication or attend required counseling sessions.\u201d Id. In doing so, he arbitrarily \ndiscounted Applicant\u2019s own testimony at the hearing, which reflects: \nDEPARTMENT COUNSEL: At one point, you -- toward the -- in \nJune of -- in June of 2020, you had an office appointment with Dr. \n4 AG \u00b6 28(d): failure to follow a prescribed treatment plan related to a diagnosed psychological/psychiatric condition \nthat may impair judgment, stability, reliability, or trustworthiness, including, but not limited to, failure to take \nprescribed medication or failure to attend required counseling sessions. \n5 AG \u00b6 28(a): behavior that casts doubt on an individual\u2019s judgment, stability, reliability, or trustworthiness, not \ncovered under any other guideline and that may indicate an emotional, mental, or personality condition, including, but \nnot limited to, irresponsible, violent, self-harm, suicidal, paranoid, manipulative, impulsive, chronic lying, deceitful, \nexploitative, or bizarre behaviors. \n6 AG \u00b6 28(b): an opinion by a duly qualified mental health professional that the individual has a condition that may \nimpair judgment, stability, reliability, or trustworthiness. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n[L].

He \ndid not say, you know -- he didn\u2019t -- I would\u2019ve never thought about \nit again, unless it had been brought up when I had my evaluation \nwith Dr. [B]. It would\u2019ve -- that five-minute conversation would\u2019ve \nnever crossed my mind again. \n. . . \nOther than him saying, you know, I don\u2019t think that\u2019s a good idea, \nno. And I assured him, like I sought him out in the beginning, if at \nany point, I felt that things were going sideways or going down or \ngoing up, that I would have no problem to call and see him again. \nTranscript (Tr.) at 79-80. Applicant\u2019s testimony was supported and amplified by Dr. B\u2019s evaluation \nand report, and in particular her consultation with Dr. L: \nTo the contrary, Dr. [L] stated today that [Applicant] presented to \nhis office for an appointment in June 2021 and informed him that \nshe had discontinued Lamictal. He attempted to educate her on the \ndangers of not taking a mood stabilizer for her condition, but she \nrefused to resume pharmacotherapy for bipolar disorder. She did \naccept prescriptions of Klonopin and buspar during that \nappointment. He requested that she return in October 2021 for \nfollow-up, but [Applicant] has not returned to see her psychiatrist \nsince the June 2021 appointment. \nGovernment Exhibit (GE) 4 at 3. The record supports application of AG \u00b6 28(d), as Applicant \nstopped taking Lamictal against the advice of Dr. L. The Judge\u2019s finding to the contrary ignored \nthis record evidence, which was in error. \nMoving to the Judge\u2019s application of mitigating conditions, we find his analysis incomplete \nand unsupported by the record evidence. In applying AG \u00b6\u00b6 29(a) and 29(b),7 the Judge only \naddressed Applicant\u2019s history of anxiety and depression and found that these conditions are readily \ncontrollable with treatment. In doing so, he blatantly ignored the record evidence that Applicant \nwas diagnosed and treated for some version of bipolar disorder, as discussed below. He further \nerroneously found that she \u201cconsistently took her medication and attended her appointments with \nDr. L,\u201d despite the evidence discussed above to the contrary. Remand Decision at 15. The Judge \n7 AG \u00b6\u00b6 29: (a) the identified condition is readily controllable with treatment, and the individual has demonstrated \nongoing and consistent compliance with the treatment plan; (b) the individual has voluntarily entered a counseling or \ntreatment program for a condition that is amenable to treatment, and the individual is currently receiving counseling \nor treatment with a favorable prognosis by a duly qualified mental health professional. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nfound that, \u201c[i]n this case, the most reliable account of Applicant\u2019s mental health history and \ntreatment is her own testimony.\u201d Id. at 16. Yet he fails to consider significant contrary record \nevidence and evidentiary inconsistencies, including those found throughout Applicant\u2019s own \ndisclosures. \nWhile the Judge\u2019s analysis focused on purported inaccuracies in Dr. B\u2019s evaluation, the \nrecord reflects multiple inconsistencies in Applicant\u2019s statements as made to all three doctors who \nevaluated her in 2022 and at other points during her national security adjudication. These include \nbut are not limited to variances in reporting of her past diagnoses and medication and treatment \nhistory; variances in the milligrams of Lamictal she was prescribed;8 variances in her reason for \nresuming Lamictal;9 and variances in the details of her DUI. When conflicts exist within the record, \na judge must weigh the evidence and resolve such conflicts based upon a careful evaluation of \nfactors such as the evidence\u2019s \u201ccomparative reliability, plausibility and ultimate truthfulness.\u201d \nISCR Case No. 05-06723 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 14, 2007). Here, the Judge was required to weigh \nthe conflicting evidence and articulate a sustainable rationale for resolving it \u2013 here, universally \u2013 \nin Applicant\u2019s favor. Considering the record as a whole and specifically Applicant\u2019s other \nreporting inconsistencies, we see no reasonable and sustainable way for him to have done so. \nAnother significant factor in the Judge\u2019s favorable analysis was his finding that Applicant \npresented sufficient evidence to rebut \u201cthat she has bipolar disorder.\u201d Remand Decision at 15. \nContrary to that finding, a close review of the record leaves no doubt that Applicant was diagnosed \nwith and treated for bipolar disorder by Dr. L, even though the type was not specified with \nreference to the DSM. In her Answer to the SOR, Applicant acknowledged that she treated with \nDr. L from approximately 2010 to 2021, and that, while she \u201chas had a treatable condition and \nsuccessfully and willingly treated it in the past, [she] is no longer in need of continued treatment \nfor Bipolar Disorder.\u201d SOR Response at 7. She separately acknowledged that she had a \u201cprevious \ndiagnosis of Bipolar Disorder and wished to reevaluate.\u201d Id. at 8. \nThe diagnosis was further substantiated by Applicant\u2019s Answers to Interrogatories, in \nwhich she noted, \u201cI have and am currently taking Lamictal (50 mg) for mood swings. Although it \nhas never been officially diagnosed or any tests performed, it has been suggested I may be bipolar.\u201d \nGE 2 at 14 (emphasis added). Applicant also disclosed her past bipolar disorder diagnosis to Dr. P \nduring the evaluation on May 12, 2022. In his report, Dr. P noted that Applicant \u201cadmits that she \nwas treated for Bipolar Disorder by a local psychiatrist\u201d and that the \u201cdiagnosis of Bipolar Disorder \nfrom the psychiatrist was approximately ten years ago, and she was being treated successfully.\u201d \n8 For example, Applicant reported in her March 2022 interrogatory response that her prescription upon resuming \nLamictal the prior month was for 50 milligrams \u201cfor mood swings.\u201d GE 2 at 14. Two months later, however, in her \nMay 2022 evaluation with Dr. H, a board-certified addiction and internal medicine doctor, Applicant reported that she \nstarted on 100 milligrams when she resumed the medication. AE J at 1. \n9 For example, Applicant reported to Dr. H that she felt \u201csubpar\u201d after she weaned off Lamictal and, when she decided \nto resume the medication in February 2022, she \u201cconsulted another physician as her insurance had changed and \nrequired a change of provider.\u201d AE J at 1. At hearing, however, Applicant testified that her decision to discontinue \ntreatment with Dr. L was driven by her opinion that the relationship had become unproductive and that she was \u201can \neasy cash cow\u201d for him, and her increasing reliance on support from other medical professionals, including her general \npractitioner. Tr. at 56, 59-61. She also explained that her motivation for resuming the medication in February 2022 \nwas the impression that she would be unable to keep her job without it. \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAE I at 1. Dr. P also opined: \u201cIn essence, there is no evidence that she has a current diagnosis of \nBipolar Disorder. This does not dispute the psychiatrist\u2019s diagnosis.\u201d Id. at 2 (emphasis added). \nHis assessment of Applicant was that \u201c[t]he MMPI assessment actually indicates no specific \ndisorder of any kind.\u201d Id. at 3. We note that Dr. P\u2019s report makes no mention of the fact that \nApplicant had resumed taking Lamictal prior to taking the MMPI, the effect that such medication \nwould have on the accuracy of the evaluation, or the diagnostic implication of her resuming a \nmedication prescribed to address mood swings and, more specifically, bipolar disorder. \nWe recognize that Dr. B\u2019s evaluation had significant room for improvement. We \npreviously noted that \u201cDr. B\u2019s generic diagnosis of \u2018bipolar disorder\u2019 is not a diagnosis found in \nthe DSM-5, as she failed to distinguish between bipolar I disorder or bipolar II disorder, failed to \nspecify whether the current or most recent episode was hypomanic or depressive, failed to specify \nwhether Applicant was in partial or full remission, and failed to specify whether, if Applicant was \nnot in remission, the episode was mild, moderate, or severe.\u201d Remand Order at 7-8. However, we \nalso note that neither Security Executive Agent Directive 4, nor Appeal Board precedent require a \ndiagnosis under the DSM to raise concerns under this adjudicative guideline. See ISCR Case No. \n01-02046 at 3 (App. Bd. May 22, 2003). Instead, the judge must consider all of the record evidence \nand weigh it accordingly. Here, the Judge\u2019s finding that \u201cApplicant\u2019s testimony and the two \nmedical reports she submitted in evidence rebut Dr. B\u2019s diagnosis that she has bipolar disorder\u201d \noverlooks the evidence that she was diagnosed with some form of bipolar disorder and was treated \nfor it for at least ten years by Dr. L. Remand Decision at 15. \nThe Board will not disturb a judge\u2019s weighing of the record evidence unless there has been \na showing that the judge acted in a manner that is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law. See, \ne.g., ISCR Case No. 00-0621 at 3 (App. Bd. Jan. 30, 2002). We have addressed conflicting expert \nopinions in the past, noting that a judge \u201cis neither compelled to accept a DoD-required \npsychologist\u2019s diagnosis of an applicant nor bound by any expert\u2019s testimony or report. Rather, \nthe Judge has to consider the record evidence as a whole in deciding what weight to give \nconflicting expert opinions.\u201d ISCR Case No. 19-00151 at 8 (App. Bd. Dec. 10, 2019). However, \nthe Judge here failed to consider the whole record when he discounted Applicant\u2019s previous \nadmissions of a ten-year treatment with Lamictal and prior diagnosis of bipolar disorder. The Judge \nthen improperly elected to focus only on the diagnoses of anxiety and depression in his mitigation \nanalysis. In doing so, he failed to articulate a satisfactory explanation for his conclusions that \nApplicant successfully met her burden to mitigate the Government\u2019s concerns and that she should \nbe eligible for a security clearance under the Whole-Person Concept. We need not address the rest \nof the Government\u2019s claims. \nA favorable clearance decision means that the record discloses no basis for doubt about an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. See ISCR Case No. 12-00270 at 3 (App. \nBd. Jan. 17, 2014). In the case before us, the record discloses many reasons to doubt Applicant\u2019s \ncurrent judgment and reliability and to conclude that Applicant has failed to meet her burden of \npersuasion regarding mitigation. The Remand Decision is not sustainable. \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nConclusion \nWhen the Board finds that a judge\u2019s decision is unsustainable, we must determine if the \nappropriate remedy is remand or reversal. The former is appropriate when the legal errors can be \ncorrected through remand and there is a significant chance of reaching a different result upon \ncorrection, such as when a judge fails to consider relevant and material evidence. If the identified \nerrors cannot be remedied on remand, the decision must be reversed. Such is the case when, after \naddressing the identified error, the Board concludes that a contrary formal finding or overall grant \nor denial of national security eligibility is the clear outcome based on the record. ISCR Case No. \n22-01002 at 4 (App. Bd. Sep. 26, 2024) (citation omitted). \nThe Government has met its burden on appeal of demonstrating reversible error below. \nConsidering the record as a whole, the Judge\u2019s decision is arbitrary and capricious as it fails to \nexamine relevant evidence and important aspects of the case, fails to articulate a satisfactory \nexplanation for material conclusions, and runs contrary to the weight of the record evidence. \nAccordingly, the Judge\u2019s favorable decision is not sustainable under Egan. After addressing the \nidentified errors, the Board concludes that a denial of national security eligibility is the clear \noutcome based on the record and the Judge\u2019s favorable decision is reversed \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nOrder \nThe Judge\u2019s favorable decision in ISCR Case No. 22-00396 is REVERSED. \nSigned: Moira Modzelewski \nMoira Modzelewski \nAdministrative Judge \nChair, Appeal Board \nSigned: Allison Marie \nAllison Marie \nAdministrative Judge \nMember, Appeal Board \nSigned: Jennifer Goldstein \nJennifer Goldstein \nAdministrative Judge \nMember, Appeal Board \n10 \n",

Conway, Esq. \nThe Department of Defense (DoD) declined to grant Applicant a security clearance. On \nAugust 8, 2022, DoD issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the basis for that \ndecision \u2013 security concerns raised under Guidelines E (Personal Conduct) and J (Criminal \nConduct) of the National Security Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) of Security Executive Agent \nDirective 4 (effective June 8, 2017) (SEAD 4) and DoD Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as \namended) (Directive). Although Applicant requested a decision based upon the written record, the \nGovernment requested and was granted a hearing. On March 11, 2024, Defense Office of Hearings \nand Appeals Administrative Judge Robert Tuider (AJ1) granted Applicant security clearance \neligibility. \nUnder Guideline J, the SOR alleged that Applicant was arrested on three occasions, that he \nwas charged with crimes of domestic violence/abuse against two ex-wives, and that Temporary \nRestraining Orders (TRO) were issued against him in two of the instances. The Guideline J \nallegations were cross-alleged under Guideline E.

In his mitigation analysis, the AJ cited to AG \u00b6\u00b6 17(f) and AG 32(c)2 in concluding \nthat \u201cthere is not reliable evidence to support a finding that the allegations occurred as alleged\u201d \nand that \u201cApplicant refuted the allegations.\u201d Id. at 6. The Judge also found other mitigating \nconditions partially or fully applicable, including ones that are inherently contradictory with a \ndetermination that the conduct did not occur (e.g., an application of \u201csuccessful rehabilitation\u201d \nunder AG \u00b6 32 (d)). On appeal from that Decision, the Government asserted that the AJ substituted \na favorable credibility determination for record evidence and that he erred in finding that Applicant \ndid not abuse his two ex-wives. On June 13, 2024, the Appeal Board remanded the case, instructing \nthe AJ to explain why he found Applicant\u2019s denial of wrongdoing to be credible in light of \nsignificant evidence to the contrary. \nOn February 25, 2025, the AJ issued a Remand Decision in which he concluded not that \nthe established concerns were mitigated but instead that the Government had failed to establish a \nprima facie case proving that Applicant had committed the conduct alleged in the SOR. Remand \nDecision at 9. The Government again appealed, asserting that the AJ erred in his determination \nthat the Government failed to establish a prima facie case, erred in finding that Applicant did not \nabuse his two ex-wives, and substituted a favorable credibility determination for record evidence. \nConsistent with the following, we reverse. \nBackground \nApplicant is in his mid-30s and has worked as a lead analyst for a defense contractor since \nSeptember 2022. He earned a master's degree in August 2019 and was pursuing a doctorate at the \ntime of his hearing. Applicant served in the U.S. military on active duty from 2009 until early 2017 \nand in the Reserve force from early 2017 to 2020. He was honorably discharged. Applicant \nsuccessfully held security clearances while he was on active duty in the U.S. military. Since his \nrelease from active duty, Applicant has worked exclusively for defense contractors. \nApplicant has been married twice. His first marriage was from August 2012 to December \n2017, and his second marriage was from March 2019 to May 2022. Both marriages ended by \ndivorce. He has no biological children. \nApplicant's first wife (W1) was an active-duty soldier and single mother whom he met on \npost and married in August 2012. On May 17, 2017, Applicant and W1 had an argument that \nescalated and led to W1 petitioning for a temporary restraining order (TRO) against Applicant on \nthe following day. Applicant was arrested and spent two days in custody. He was charged with \nAbuse of Family and Household Members, a misdemeanor. W1\u2019s petition for a TRO detailed two \ninstances of physical and verbal abuse. She stated that Applicant \u201cchoked [her] when arguing\u201d and \nthat he \u201cwas threatening to use the firearms on [her].\u201d Additionally, the petition noted that her \n2 AG \u00b617(f): the information was unsubstantiated or from a source of questionable reliability; and AG \u00b6 32(c): no \nreliable evidence to support that the individual committed the offense. \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ndaughter \u2013 Applicant\u2019s stepdaughter \u2013 was home at the time of the incident and \u201cis afraid of her \ndad and doesn\u2019t want him to come home.\u201d (AE F at 3-4.) The court granted the TRO. \nOn May 31, 2017, W1 moved to dissolve the TRO, and the court granted her request. On \nJune 26, 2017, the State requested a continuance because it was having difficulty locating W1. The \ncase was rescheduled to July 31, 2017, and both W1 and her daughter were present to testify, but \nthe case was postponed due to the court\u2019s calendar congestion. On August 21, 2017, the criminal \ncase against Applicant was dismissed without prejudice because W1 and her daughter failed to \nappear at that hearing. The case was later dismissed with prejudice on September 20, 2017. \nApplicant subsequently initiated divorce proceedings against W1, and their divorce was final on \nDecember 26, 2017. \nApplicant married his second wife (W2) on March 14, 2019. She was a Japanese resident \ncitizen whom he met online. She immigrated to the United States on a fianc\u00e9e visa, making her \neligible to apply for permanent residency after two years of marriage. \nApplicant was arrested and charged with abuse of W2 twice, as alleged. He disputed the \nunderlying facts that caused the arrests. Both Applicant and W2 made detailed allegations about \nthe abuse they suffered during their marriage in separate TRO petitions. In her petition, W2 \ndetailed six instances of physical and mental abuse that she claimed occurred during their first year \nof marriage. During his security clearance investigation, Applicant was questioned about some of \nthe alleged events, and his version of the events was summarized in his personal security interview \n(PSI), as well as in his own 2021 petition for a TRO. Drawing from record evidence, W1\u2019s six \nallegations of abuse, Applicant\u2019s four counter-allegations, and Applicant\u2019s explanations are set \nforth below in chronological order. \nThe first altercation between Applicant and W2 occurred in March 2019. W2 reported she \nasked him to stop cheating on her and to stop talking to other women. She indicated he responded \nto her request by threatening to deport her. W2 claimed he turned off her phone service to control \nher. She noted he breaks and throws things but tries to make it look like she did it. In his PSI, \nApplicant explained this event claiming they got into a verbal altercation, and it resulted in W2 \nscratching his arm. He claimed that his arm was bleeding and that he called 911 because he wanted \nmedical attention. Police were called to the scene, but no arrests were made. \nOn June 10, 2019, W2 again asked Applicant to stop cheating on her. She claimed that \ntheir verbal altercation turned physical when he twisted her arm and threatened to break it. She \nsaid that she \"went to the hospital\" because the \u201cleft side of her body was numb\u201d after this event. \nNeither the PSI nor the Applicant\u2019s TRO petition address this allegation. \nIn his 2021 petition for the TRO, Applicant reported that on June 23, 2019, W2 threw \ndishes at his head and was trying to force him to fill out her green card application. He decided to \nleave their home, but she grabbed his arm to prevent him from leaving. She cut him with one of \nher fingernails. He then called the police and requested medical attention. He claimed he was \nbleeding profusely from the cut. \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nIn July 2019, Applicant was arrested and charged with abuse.

He stopped [her from] calling [an] ambulance by taking [her] phone.\u201d The AJ \nnoted that she claimed that she \"had to go to EMS\" due to \"many bruises and bumps.\" Decision at \n5. In his PSI, Applicant explained that he got into a verbal altercation with W2 regarding his dating \nhistory, his past financial debts, and how he does not spend more money on her. During the verbal \naltercation, Applicant stated that W2 kept swinging her arm at him, attempting to hit him. He \nclaimed to have protected himself by grabbing her arms to avoid her from hitting him. Applicant \nfurther explained that W2 fell on the bed while still trying to attack him. He claimed he never hit \nher. He believes his neighbor called the police. Applicant claimed that this arrest was expunged \nbut presented no documentation to support this claim. \nW2 claimed that on August 29, 2019, Applicant grabbed her arm and slapped her face \nduring an argument in the car. She reported that he hit her hand when she tried to get out of the car \nand that he stopped her from calling the police. W2 stated that he left her on the side of the road \nafter the incident knowing she did not have any way to get home and that he threatened to change \nthe locks to the apartment. Applicant\u2019s PSI reflected only that he and W2 got into a verbal \naltercation. He stated that the police arrived and mediated the situation to make sure there were no \nproblems. No arrest was made. \nW2 claimed that on October 29, 2019, she asked Applicant to get her health insurance, but \nhe said she did not deserve any. During their argument, he broke chairs and threw them against \nthe wall, damaging shelf doors and the wall. She also claimed he lifted her body up and threw her \nagainst the couch two times, which caused her back pain. She indicated he pushed her into the \nwall. The PSI did not address this allegation, but Applicant stated in his testimony that she was \ncovered by his health insurance. \nApplicant\u2019s 2021 TRO application indicated W2 punched him with her right fist while he \nwas sleeping on November 21, 2019. He claimed he woke up to see his face was red and bruised. \nHe was also bleeding from his right arm. He alleged that, later that night, she elbowed him in the \nface, broke a trophy, and screamed at him. \nW2 reported that on February 8, 2020, Applicant pushed her \u201cvery intensely\u201d and that she \nfell as a result. She also noted that Applicant turned off her phone service because he wanted to \nhide that he hit her. He was arrested on February 9, 2020, and charged with abuse of \nFamily/Household Member. Applicant reported that he and W2 got into a verbal argument. At the \nend of their argument, W2 left and went to their neighbor's residence. Applicant also left his \nresidence but not before locking W2's bag in his safe. After Applicant left, he received a call from \nthe police department informing him he needed to return W2's bag. Applicant complied, and he \nretrieved her bag and provided it to the police officer with no action taken against him. About an \nhour later, the police returned because W2 accused him of physically hitting her. Applicant was \narrested and charged with domestic violence and taken to the police substation. He claimed in his \nPSI that the police released him because the prosecutor did not want to pursue the case due to \ninsufficient evidence. No charges were filed against him. About a week later, Applicant applied \nfor the arrest to be expunged. In the PSI, Applicant explained that W2 admitted lying to the police \nby telling them Applicant hit her, even though he did not. He also claimed that W2 told the police \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nhe hit her because Applicant raised his voice to her and she got scared. This arrest was expunged \nfrom Applicant\u2019s record by court order dated February 12, 2020. \nOn February 26, 2020, W2 filed her TRO application, noting Applicant slapped and pushed \nher earlier that morning. It contained the details of the earlier incidents detailed above as well as \nthis new allegation. In her TRO petition, W2 responded to Applicant\u2019s allegations that she lied to \npolice, stating, \u201cI never lied to them.\u201d AE E at 6. On March 10, 2020, a hearing was held regarding \nthe TRO. W2 requested to dissolve the TRO. The judge denied her request and continued the case. \nOn May 26, 2020, W2 requested a second time to dissolve the TRO. The judge denied her request \nand continued the hearing. At this May 2020 TRO hearing, Applicant was ordered (in contrast to \nthe AJ\u2019s finding that he \u201cvolunteered\u201d) to attend domestic violence intervention (DVI) classes and \nto provide documentation regarding the status of the classes to the court. He did so for the duration \nof the active restraining order. \nOn June 29, 2020, after receiving testimony from both parties, the judge took judicial notice \nof the records and files. Applicant was to provide the court with documentation related to DVI \nservices and individual or marriage therapy. She also ordered all other provisions of the TRO to \nremain in effect and continued the hearing until August 24, 2020. On August 24, 2020, the judge \nordered that the TRO granted on February 26, 2020, be dissolved per W2\u2019s request and vacated it \nwithout prejudice. \nAlthough Applicant and W2 had separated in April 2020 and W2 had expressed her desire \nto file for divorce, the couple reconciled in November 2020 and attempted to work on their \nmarriage, attending marriage counseling together. W2 left Applicant again in April 2021, however, \nand returned to Japan. Applicant then filed for divorce. \nW2 returned from Japan in early August 2021 to respond to the petition for divorce. On \nAugust 11, 2021, Applicant filed for a TRO against W2. On September 8, 2021, W2 and Applicant \nappeared at the TRO hearing. Per agreement of the parties, the judge ordered that the TRO be \ndissolved with prejudice because Applicant and W2 voluntarily entered into a no-contact order in \ntheir divorce case. \nApplicant alleged that W2 began to contact him again in November 2021. Specifically, he \nalleged that on November 12, 2021, W2 sent him several emails that were unrelated to their divorce \nand appeared at his door despite being cautioned by the family court judge to contact him only on \nissues related to the divorce. He further alleged that on November 13, 2021, W2 again went to \nApplicant\u2019s apartment, used his spare key, and entered the apartment. Following that incident, \nApplicant called the police. Applicant reported that W2 again entered his apartment on November \n29, 2021, when he was not present and left a bill. He reported that his house key was missing, his \nwalls were damaged, and several personal items were missing. \nOn November 30, 2021, Applicant filed a petition for an order of protection against W2. \nIn his petition, Applicant claimed that between March 14, 2019 (their wedding day) and June 10, \n2021, W2 had been mentally and physically abusive, to include specific allegations that she \nslapped him in the back of the head while he was driving, dug her fingernails into his skin, \nscreamed and yelled at him, broke items in his home, punched him in the face several times, \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nthreatened to kill herself with his firearm, threw a dustpan at him, and hopped on the hood of his \ncar.

See \nDorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th Cir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991). After \nthe Government produces evidence raising security concerns, an applicant bears the burden of \npersuasion concerning mitigation. See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. The standard applicable in security \nclearance decisions is that a clearance may be granted only when \u201cclearly consistent with the \ninterests of the national security.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). \n\u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security eligibility will be resolved \nin favor of the national security.\u201d AG \u00b6 2(b). \nOn appeal, the Government challenges the AJ\u2019s factual findings and argues that the AJ\u2019s \nanalyses under the disqualifying conditions for Guidelines J and E and the Whole-Person Concept \nwere arbitrary, capricious, and not supported by the record evidence. When a judge\u2019s findings are \nchallenged, we examine them to see if they are supported by substantial evidence, i.e., \u201csuch \nrelevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion in light \nof all the contrary evidence in the same record.\u201d Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1. The Board must consider \nnot only whether there is record evidence supporting a judge\u2019s findings, but also whether there is \nevidence that fairly detracts from the weight of the evidence supporting those findings, and \nwhether the Judge\u2019s findings reflect a reasonable interpretation of the record evidence as a whole. \nISCR Case No. 02-12199 at 3 (App. Bd. Aug. 8, 2005). A judge\u2019s decision can be found to be \narbitrary or capricious if it \u201cfails to examine relevant evidence, fails to articulate a rational \nconnection between the facts found and the choice made, fails to be based on a consideration of \nrelevant factors, involves a clear error of judgment, fails to consider an important aspect of the \ncase, or is so implausible as to indicate more than a mere difference of opinion.\u201d ISCR Case No. \n94-0215, 1995 WL 396942 at *3 (App. Bd. Apr. 13, 1995) (citing Motor Vehicle Mfr. Ass\u2019n v. \nState Farm Mut. Ins. Co., 463 U.S. 29, 43 (1983)). For the reasons stated below, we reverse the \nAJ\u2019s Remand Decision. \nUpon remand, the AJ concluded that the record evidence failed to establish a prima facie \ncase under either Guideline J or Guideline E. That conclusion is both curious and wrong for at \nleast four reasons. First, in his Decision, the AJ found \u2014 albeit equivocally \u2014 that the Government \nhad carried its burden. Second, the Appeal Board concluded in our Remand Order that the \nGovernment had met its burden \u2014 that \u201cthere was evidence that Applicant committed various \nspecific acts of domestic violence.\u201d Remand Order at 3. Third, by revisiting the issue of whether \nthe Government had carried its burden, the AJ strayed well outside the bounds of the Remand \nOrder, which specifically required him to reconcile his credibility determination with all the \nevidence to the contrary. And, fourth, in arriving at his conclusion that the Government failed to \nmake a prima facie case, the AJ simply chose to ignore significant evidence of record. For brevity\u2019s \nsake, our discussion will focus on this fourth and dispositive issue \u2014 the Judge\u2019s failure to consider \nrelevant evidence. For the reasons detailed below, we conclude that the AJ\u2019s findings do not reflect \na reasonable interpretation of the record evidence and that his conclusions were arbitrary and \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ncapricious as he failed to examine relevant evidence and, consequently, failed to consider \nimportant aspects of the case.  \nIt is well-established that DOHA security clearance adjudications are administrative \nproceedings, and the \u201cbeyond a reasonable doubt\u201d burden of proof associated with criminal \nproceedings is not applicable. Similarly, the \u201cpreponderance of the evidence\u201d standard in civil \nproceedings such as a TRO is not applicable. Instead, the Government must prove any controverted \nfacts by substantial evidence \u2014 that is, more than a scintilla, but less than a preponderance of the \nevidence. \nApplicant admitted to the arrests and restraining orders, thus relieving the Government of \nproducing additional evidence as to the specific allegations. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14. ISCR Case 07\u00ad\n13766 at 3 (App. Bd. Nov. 12, 2008). Applicant, however, denied the underlying conduct, placing \nthe burden on the Government as to those controverted facts. As we discussed in our Remand \nOrder and as recited in the lengthy chronology of events above, the Government\u2019s evidence \nincluded petitions for TROs/Protective Orders submitted under penalty of perjury by both of \nApplicant\u2019s former wives, and those petitions detailed multiple acts of domestic violence spanning \na three-year period. That substantial record evidence inarguably established a prima facie case. \nThe AJ\u2019s conclusion otherwise \u2014 that the Government failed to carry its burden \u2014 is inexplicable \nand erroneous. \nEven had the AJ correctly concluded that the Government presented a prima facie case and \nsubsequently addressed the case in terms of mitigation, the analysis he provides in his Remand \nDecision does not overcome the Board\u2019s previous concern \u2014 that he substituted a favorable \ncredibility determination for significant contrary record evidence. In our remand, the AJ was \ninstructed to reconcile his favorable credibility determination for the Applicant with the record \nevidence to the contrary. That is, he was instructed to explain why he believed Applicant\u2019s \nassertions that the underlying domestic violence did not occur in light of the allegations made by \nboth of his ex-wives. The AJ failed to do so. Instead, he again focused on Applicant\u2019s denials, \nemphasized the lack of corroboration of the former wives\u2019 allegations of abuse, and minimized or \nignored the Government\u2019s evidence before concluding that the evidence was \u201cinsufficient to \nestablish the allegations that Applicant committed the offenses alleged in the SOR.\u201d Remand \nDecision at 10. \nThe AJ\u2019s Findings of Fact and conclusions regarding Applicant\u2019s arrest in July 2019 \nprovide an illustrative example of his problematic approach to the evidence. In his Findings of \nFact regarding the July 2019 arrest, the AJ noted that \u201c[t]he only source document contained in \nthe case file describing this incident is the [PSI] of the Applicant conducted under oath on \nNovember 3, 2020.\u201d Id. at 3. That finding is directly contradicted by the record, which contains \nW2\u2019s TRO application discussing the incident in detail. The AJ did not even acknowledge that \ncritical evidence, much less discuss why he did not find it credible. Instead, he later relies on his \nerroneous Finding of Fact in his analysis section, again citing to a lack of evidence that \ncontradicted Applicant\u2019s version of events before concluding that \u201c[t]he evidence that Applicant \nprovided to the investigator clearly does not support the allegation\u201d and that Applicant\u2019s PSI, if \nbelieved \u201cexonerates Applicant and refutes her allegations.\u201d Id. at 9. The AJ also found that \nApplicant's charge from the July 2019 incident \u201cwas dismissed with prejudice for lack of \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nevidence.\u201d Id. However, a thorough examination of the record reveals that Applicant\u2019s claim that \nthe charge was dismissed for \u201clack of evidence\u201d is unsupported by any corroborating evidence. As \nwe have frequently discussed, charges can be dismissed or not pursued for any number of reasons \nthat do not justify a conclusion that an applicant did not commit the conduct in question. E.g., \nISCR Case No. 18-02018 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 4, 2021) (\u201c[T]he decision by the law enforcement \nauthorities in this case not to pursue criminal charges against Applicant due to the mother's \ndecision not to let her daughter testify does not amount to a finding of \u201cnot guilty\u201d or a \ndetermination of innocence.\u201d). A judge should not make assumptions or draw inferences about \nwhy there was no prosecution without corroborating evidence beyond Applicant\u2019s self-serving \naverments. See ISCR Case No. 20-00347 at 7 (App. Bd. Aug 11, 2021). \nApplicant was accused of domestic violence by both of his former wives. In all instances, \nhe claimed the underlying conduct for which he was arrested or a TRO was issued did not occur. \nWe have previously noted that similar allegations made against an applicant by different accusers \nmay add weight to the validity of those accusations. ISCR Case No. 14-01763 at 3-4 (App. Bd. \nNov. 3, 2015) (discussing a pattern of domestic violence allegations). The AJ failed to consider \nthis important aspect of the case \u2014 the improbability that two women, with no known ties to each \nother, would fabricate similar allegations against Applicant. As we noted previously in this case \u2013 \nWhile the former spouses were not present at the hearing to provide testimony, their \nstatements given under penalty of perjury in a civil judicial proceeding are entitled \nto significant weight and cannot be ignored simply because the proponents of those \nstatements are not present at the hearing. The [AJ] did not assess the contents of \nthose statements individually and in context with each other, nor did he explain \nwhy he discounted evidence which, on its face, would suggest that Applicant\u2019s \nversion of events was self-serving. \nRemand Order at 5. \nAdditionally, as we have previously discussed, the time between the incident and the \nreporting of the incident should be assessed in determining the amount of weight placed on the \nstatements. ISCR Case No. 22-00749 at 8 (App. Bd. Sept. 11, 2023). Here, W1 filed her petition \ncontaining the details of the abuse the day after the 2017 incident. The 2019 arrest involving W2 \nresulted in Applicant\u2019s arrest four days after the incident. The petition for the TRO was filed in \nclose relation to Applicant\u2019s February 2020 arrest and on the same day as the final allegation of \nabuse. On remand, the AJ again failed to consider this aspect of the case and failed to explain the \nweight he afforded to Applicant\u2019s denials in the face of this significant evidence to the contrary. \nIn summary, the AJ failed to examine relevant evidence, which led to his failure to consider \nimportant aspects of the case. Although a judge is not required to discuss each piece of record \nevidence in making a decision, the judge cannot ignore, disregard, or fail to discuss significant \nrecord evidence that a reasonable person could expect to be taken into account in reaching a fair \nand reasoned decision. E.g., ISCR Case No. 21-01551 at 4 (App. Bd. Jul. 20, 2022.) Simply \nbecause an applicant explains events, a judge should not accept the explanation without \nconsidering evidence that fairly detracts from it. \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nWhile the Board is required to give deference to a judge's credibility determination, that \ndeference has its limits. We evaluate a credibility determination in light of the record as a whole. \nA judge is expected to explain why an applicant's version of an event is worthy of belief when it \nis contradicted by other evidence. Failure to do so suggests that the judge merely substituted a \nfavorable impression of an applicant's demeanor for record evidence. E.g., ISCR Case No. 18\u00ad\n01926 at 4 (App. Bd. Sep. 20, 2019). A credibility determination may be set aside or reversed if it \nis unreasonable, contradicts other findings, is based on an inadequate reason, is patently without \nbasis in the record, or is inherently improbable or discredited by undisputed fact. ISCR Case No. \n97-0184 at 4 (App. Bd. Dec. 8, 1998). \u201cWhen a witness's story is contradicted by other evidence \nor is so internally inconsistent or implausible that a reasonable fact finder would not credit it, we \ncan find error despite the deference owed a Judge's credibility determination.\u201d ISCR Case No. 10\u00ad\n03886 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr 26, 2012), citing Anderson v. Bessemer City, 470 U.S. 564 at 575 (1985). \nHere, the perfunctory manner in which the AJ addressed record evidence of the former wives\u2019 \nallegations constitutes a failure to adequately consider significant evidence contrary to Applicant\u2019s \nassertions and to explain his determination that Applicant was credible. We conclude that the Judge \nunreasonably substituted a favorable impression of Applicant for record evidence. \nConclusion \nThe AJ\u2019s Remand Decision in this matter was arbitrary and capricious in that it failed to \nconsider relevant evidence, failed to consider important aspects of the case, and offered an \nexplanation for the decision that runs contrary to the record evidence. The standard applicable in \nnational security decisions is that eligibility may be granted only when \u201cclearly consistent with the \ninterests of the national security.\u201d Dept. of Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988)). Here, the \nJudge\u2019s Remand Decision is not sustainable under the Egan standard and must be reversed. See \nISCR Case No. 22-01002 at 4 (App. Bd. Sep. 26, 2024) (Reversal is appropriate when the Board \nconcludes from the record that a contrary formal finding or overall grant or denial of security \nclearance eligibility is the clear outcome.). \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nORDER \nThe favorable security clearance Remand Decision in ISCR Case No. 22-00761 is \nREVERSED. \nSigned: Moira Modzelewski \nMoira Modzelewski \nAdministrative Judge \nChair, Appeal Board \nSigned: Jennifer I.

    "summary": "findings of fact. Applicant denies that he made the admissions that are reflected in those reports. Although the Judge characterized Applicant\u2019s claim to be that the polygraphers misinterpreted his statements, Applicant is arguing on appeal that the polygraphers actually misrepresented his answers and submitted \u201cfalse\u201d statements in their reports. Appeal Brief at 2, 9, 12, 17. Applicant acknowledges that he has \u201cno evidence that all three examiners worked together to make the consistent allegations,\u201d but he nevertheless asserts that the \u201cchief adjudicator\u201d at the AGA \u201cwas directing all three examiners behind the doors.\u201d Id. at 14. We have considered Applicant\u2019s arguments in light of the record as a whole and find them unpersuasive. First, his argument that the polygraphers\u2019 reports are not \u201creal evidence\u201d and cannot establish the Government\u2019s case is without merit. Applicant did not object to the admission of GE 2 but now argues that it should be given no weight, in part because he did not sign the summarized 13 Additionally, the dicta found in the 2015 decision\u2019s footnote misstates and thereby inadvertently broadens the dicta from the relied-upon 2006 decision, which itself cites dicta from a Supreme Court decision. Compare ISCR Case No. 02-31428 at 4 (merely acknowledging the differences between polygraph admissions and results and citing Wyrick v. Fields for its dicta that \u201cthe results of the polygraph examination might not have been admissible evidence\u201d under Missouri law",

Corrales, Esq., Deputy Chief Department Counsel \nFOR APPLICANT \nPro se \nThe Department of Defense (DoD) declined to grant Applicant a security clearance. On \nMay 10, 2023, DoD issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the basis of that \ndecision \u2013 security concerns raised under Guideline D (Sexual Behavior), Guideline E (Personal \nConduct), Guideline J (Criminal Conduct), and Guideline M (Use of Information Technology) of \nthe National Security Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) in Appendix A of Security Executive Agent \nDirective 4 (effective June 8, 2017) (SEAD 4) and DoD Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as \namended) (Directive). On March 27, 2025, Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals \nAdministrative Judge LeRoy F. Foreman denied Applicant national security eligibility. Applicant \nappealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30. \nUnder Guideline D, the SOR alleged that Applicant viewed child pornography from about \n1988 to 2011, and that he used his company-issued computer to view child pornography and other \npornography on multiple occasions. The same conduct was cross-alleged under Guideline J and \nGuideline E. Under Guideline E, the SOR also alleged that Applicant falsified material facts during \npersonal subject interviews (PSI) in October 2011 and July 2017 by seeking to conceal the \ninformation alleged under Guideline D.

Those favorable findings are not in issue on appeal, and the Judge\u2019s findings and \nconclusions pertaining to them will not be addressed below. The Judge found adversely to \nApplicant on all remaining allegations under Guideline D, Guideline E, and Guideline J. \nBackground \nApplicant is in his late 60s and has earned multiple master\u2019s degrees and a doctorate. \nMarried for almost forty years, he has three adult children. Applicant was granted security \nclearance eligibility in 1997 and access to sensitive compartmented information (SCI) in 2011. \nUpon his application for SCI eligibility, Applicant underwent a series of polygraph \nexaminations with another government agency (AGA) between May and November 2011. \nAccording to the polygrapher\u2019s report from the May 2011 examination, Applicant disclosed during \na pretest interview that he accidentally viewed adult pornography while searching at work for \nmovie and celebrity information. In a post-test discussion, Applicant reported that he used the \nsearch terms \u201cAsian woman\u201d and \u201cAsian movie star\u201d and that, when he clicked on the resulting \nsite, he briefly viewed thumbnails of both fully clothed Asian women and some naked women. He \nadmitted viewing about 200 images while at work. \nAt hearing, Applicant admitted that he searched for \u201cAsian Women\u201d or \u201cAsian Movie \nStars\u201d during his lunch hour, but he denied that he searched for pornography at work. He also \ndenied admitting to the polygrapher during his May 2011 interview that he viewed pornography \nat work. Applicant admitted telling the polygraph examiner that he opened a webpage containing \nimages of girls who appeared to be 12 or 13 years old, but he testified that he immediately closed it \nand did not download any images or content. Although the polygrapher\u2019s report stated that all the \ninformation was reviewed with Applicant and that he concurred in its accuracy, Applicant testified \nat hearing that he never had a chance to review the accuracy of the report. \nIn September 2011, Applicant underwent another polygraph examination. According to the \npolygraph examiner\u2019s report, Applicant stated that he searched for images on Google using terms \nsuch as \u201cteenage girls\u201d or \u201cLolita\u201d but that he never deliberately viewed images of anyone he \nthought was under 18 years old. At hearing, Applicant denied giving the polygraph examiner \nspecific search terms such as \u201cteenage girls\u201d or \u201cLolita.\u201d \nIn a pretest interview for his next polygraph examination in October 2011, Applicant \ndenied intentionally seeking pornography involving anyone under the age of 18 and denied \nviewing any website that did not include a legal disclaimer stating that all the persons portrayed \nare 18 years old or older. In the post-test discussion, Applicant stated that he had accidentally \nopened files containing images of females between 13 and 15 years old. At hearing, he admitted \ntelling the polygraph examiner that he accidentally opened these files. \nIn November 2011, Applicant underwent a final polygraph examination. During the pretest \ninterview, he admitted that he sought out, viewed, became aroused by, and masturbated to child \npornography about once a month from 1988 until he was interviewed in September 2011.

Applicant appealed the revocation through the AGA. His \neligibility for access to classified information was terminated on a date not clearly reflected in the \nrecord. \nApplicant applied for reinstatement of his clearance in the spring of 2016. In his July 2017 \nPSI, Applicant told the investigator that his previous application for a clearance was denied because \nthe polygraph examiner misinterpreted his answers to routine questions during the polygraph \nexamination and that he did not know what was misinterpreted because he was unable to see the \npolygraph examiner\u2019s report. \nAt hearing, Applicant stated that he had viewed no pornography since 2011 and submitted \na written statement that said, in part: \nI never thought that my actions of watching pornographic material \ncould result in this revocation. . . . In a way, it has helped me to look \nback and see how numb my moral senses were while watching the \nadult pornographic materials. I am truly sorry that the adult video \ncontains real people and they might have been models under 18 years \nold despite the fact that there was no way to [be] certain of their ages. \nDecision at 4 (quoting Applicant Exhibit 20 at 8). \nJudge\u2019s Analysis \nUnder Guideline D, the Judge found that three disqualifying conditions were established.1 \nThe Judge acknowledged Applicant\u2019s claim that the polygraph examiners misinterpreted his \nstatements during the pretest interviews and post-hearing discussions, but he highlighted that \nApplicant \u201cwas unable to identify what comments they might have misinterpreted\u201d and that it was \n\u201cnot likely that three separate polygraph examiners would have misinterpreted his comments.\u201d \nDecision at 7. In his mitigation analysis, the Judge considered the applicability of AG \u00b6 14(b),2 \nnoting Applicant\u2019s assertion that he has not viewed any pornography since his clearance was \nrevoked in 2011 and the absence of any evidence to the contrary, but concluded: \n[Applicant] has a history of conflicting admissions, denials, and \nrecantations that raise doubt about his credibility. In October 2011, \nhe told an investigator that he opened files containing child \npornography by accident. In November 2011, he told an investigator \nthat his October 2011 statement was false. At the hearing, he recanted \nhis November 2011 admission that his October 2011 statement was \nfalse. Applicant has the burden of establishing mitigating \n1 AG \u00b6\u00b6 13(a): sexual behavior of a criminal nature, whether or not the individual has been prosecuted; 13(b): pattern \nof compulsive, self-destructive, or high-risk sexual behavior that the individual is unable to stop; and 13(c): sexual \nbehavior that causes an individual to be vulnerable to coercion, exploitation, or duress. \n2 AG \u00b6 14(b): the sexual behavior happened so long ago, so infrequently, or under such unusual circumstances, that it \nis unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or judgment. \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ncircumstances. He has not carried that burden with respect to AG \u00b6 \n14(b). \nDecision at 7. Similarly, the Judge concluded that AG \u00b6 14(c)3 was inapplicable as \u201cApplicant\u2019s \nhistory of viewing [] child pornography continues to humiliate and embarrass him and make him \nvulnerable to coercion, exploitation, or duress.\u201d Decision at 7. \nUnder Guideline E, the Judge found that Applicant\u2019s history of viewing child pornography \nand of viewing adult pornography at work established AG \u00b6 16(e) and that Applicant\u2019s \nfalsifications during adjudication processes established AG \u00b6 16(b).4 Regarding the falsifications, \nthe Judge specifically found as follows: that during the post-test discussion in October 2011, \nApplicant falsely told the polygraph examiner that he accidentally opened files containing images \nof females between 13 and 15 years old; and that during the July 2017 PSI, Applicant falsely told \nthe investigator that his previous application for a clearance was denied because a polygrapher \nmisinterpreted his answers during the polygraph examination. The Judge considered the \npotentially applicable mitigation conditions under Guideline E but determined that none fully \napplied for the following reasons: Applicant recanted prior admissions and continued to maintain \nthat the allegations against him were based on the polygraphers\u2019 misinterpretation of his answers; \nhe submitted no evidence of counseling or other steps to alleviate the stressors or circumstances \nthat contributed to his involvement with pornography; and he remained vulnerable to coercion \nbecause of his past involvement with child pornography. \nUnder Guideline J, the Judge found that AG \u00b6 31(b)5 was established as Applicant admitted \nin the November 2011 pretest interview that he sought out and viewed child pornography from \n1988 until he was interviewed in September 2011. Although significant time has passed, the Judge \nconcluded that Applicant had not mitigated the security concerns as he has not accepted \nresponsibility for his conduct, noting that \u201c[w]hen an applicant is unwilling or unable to accept \nresponsibility for his or her own actions such a failure is evidence that detracts from a finding of \nreform and rehabilitation.\u201d Decision at 9 (citation omitted). \nDiscussion \nA judge\u2019s decision can be arbitrary or capricious if: \u201cit does not examine relevant evidence; \nit fails to articulate a satisfactory explanation for its conclusions, including a rational connection \nbetween the facts and the choice made; [it] does not consider relevant factors; [it] reflects a clear \nerror of judgment; it fails to consider an important aspect of the case; it offers an explanation for \nthe decision that runs contrary to the record evidence; or [it] is so implausible that it cannot be \n3 AG \u00b6 14(c): the behavior no longer serves as a basis for coercion, exploitation, or duress. \n4 AG \u00b6\u00b6 16(e): personal conduct, or concealment of information about one\u2019s conduct, that creates a vulnerability to \nexploitation, manipulation, or duress by a foreign intelligence entity or other individual or group. Such conduct \nincludes . . . : engaging in activities which, if known, could affect the person\u2019s personal, professional, or community \nstanding; and 16(b): deliberately providing false or misleading information; or concealing or omitting information, \nconcerning relevant facts to an employer, investigator, security official, competent medical or mental health \nprofessional involved in making a recommendation relevant to a national security eligibility determination. \n5 AG \u00b6 31(b): evidence (including, but not limited to, a credible allegation, an admission, and matters of official record) \nof criminal conduct, regardless of whether the individual was formally charged, prosecuted, or convicted. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \nascribed to a mere difference of opinion.\u201d ISCR Case No. 95-0600 at 4 (App. Bd. May 16, 1996) \n(citing Motor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass\u2019n v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., 463 U.S. 29, 43 (1983)). \nOn appeal, Applicant raises numerous issues and alleged errors, but they center on two \narguments that relate to polygraph examinations: 1) the Judge erred in failing to consider \nApplicant\u2019s private polygraph results; and 2) the AGA polygraphers\u2019 inculpatory reports are not \n\u201creal evidence [] such as criminal records\u201d and do not meet the Directive\u2019s requirement for \nsubstantial evidence. Appeal Brief at 12. \nPrivate Polygraph Results \nWe turn first to Applicant\u2019s argument that the Judge erred in refusing to consider his \nprivately obtained polygraph results. In Applicant\u2019s Answer to the SOR (Answer), he included the \nresults of a post-SOR private polygraph examination.6 For purposes of that examination, Applicant \ncompleted and signed a written statement consisting of two sentences attesting that: 1) he did not \ncircumvent his employer\u2019s firewall to watch child pornography; and 2) he had never searched for \nchild pornography. Answer at 7. The polygraph examination consisted of the polygrapher asking \nApplicant if he falsified any information on the two-sentence statement. In the \u201cResult\u201d section of \nhis report, the polygrapher stated: \u201cIt is the opinion of this examiner that [Applicant] was being \ntruthful during testing.\u201d Id. at 6. Said differently, the polygrapher opined that Applicant was \ntruthful when he denied that he had ever searched for child pornography. \nThe Judge took testimony from the polygrapher and confirmed that his examination \nconsisted solely of this focused inquiry into truthfulness, with no substantive discussions about the \nallegations of child pornography.

DoDM 5200.02 \u00a7 \n7.12.c. See also, e.g., ISCR Case No. 94-1057 at 6 (App. Bd. Aug. 11, 1995). On several occasions, \nthe Appeal Board has distinguished between those admissions and the technical results of the \npolygraph examination itself (i.e., the physiological data collected in response to test questions \nand the polygrapher\u2019s evaluation of that data and technical opinion as to whether the response \nindicates deception). \nIn seeking to exclude Applicant\u2019s polygraph results, the Government relied upon a 2018 \nAppeal Board decision \u2013 which cites in a footnote a 2006 Appeal Board decision \u2013 as authority to \nassert that \u201c[t]he results of polygraph tests are not admissible in DOHA proceedings.\u201d Motion in \n8 DoDI 5210.91, Polygraph and Credibility Assessment (PCA) Procedures (Aug. 12, 2010, as amended); DoDD \n5210.48, Credibility Assessment Program (Apr. 24, 2015, as amended). These regulations set forth the policy and \nprocedures for using polygraphs in screenings and investigations throughout DoD, including in national security \neligibility determinations. \n9 See also DoD Manual 5200.02, Procedures for the DoD PSP (Apr. 3, 2017), \u00a7 7.12.a (use of polygraphs is governed \nby DoDI 5210.91). \n10 See, e.g., DoDI 5210.91 \u00b6\u00b6 4; E4.2 (Counterintelligence Scope and Expanded Scope Polygraphs require objective \nquality control (QC), time and test series limits on individual examination sessions, and audio or video recording, \namong other requirements); E7.1-2 (requiring QC procedures and quality assessment (QA) inspections). \n11 See also, e.g., DoDI 5210.91 \u00b6\u00b6 E3.4 (NCCA prescribes standards for QC, conducts QA inspections of DoD and \nother federal PCA programs, and develops and provides PCA training, continuing education, and examination \nprocedures); E6 (certified polygraph examiners must generally graduate from the NCCA training program and satisfy \nother standards including completing 80 hours of NCCA-approved continuing education every two years). \n12 In a prior issuance of DoD Directive 5210.48, the use of non-federal polygraphs was explicitly prohibited in DoD \nscreenings and investigations. See DoDD 5210.48, Polygraph and Credibility Assessment Program (Jan. 25, 2007, as \namended), \u00b6 4.5 (\u201cDoD Components shall accept only PCA examinations and/or the results of such examinations that \nare conducted by Federal PCA examiners.\u201d). When that directive was reissued as the Credibility Assessment Program \nin April 2015, the language barring use of non-federal polygraphs was omitted; however, the restrictions imposed by \nDoDI 5200.02 by incorporating the requirements of DoDI 5210.91 and DoDD 5210.48 independently continue to bar \nnon-federal polygraph use in national security eligibility determinations. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nLimine at 2 (quoting ISCR Case No. 15-07539 at 5, n.3 (App Bd. Oct. 18, 2018) (citing ISCR Case \nNo. 02-31428 (App. Bd. Jan. 20, 2006)). The Judge granted the Government\u2019s motion, relying on \nthe 2006 decision to hold that \u201cthe results of a polygraph regarding the truthfulness of the \nstatements made during the examination are not admissible.\u201d Decision at 2 (citing ISCR Case No. \n02-31428 at 4). The Government\u2019s and Judge\u2019s reliance on those two cases is misplaced because, \nin both, the admissibility of polygraph results was simply not an issue before the Board and \nreference to them is only dicta.13 Rather, DoD policy does not establish or contemplate a per se \nexclusion of polygraph results, but instead prohibits taking \u201cadverse action\u201d under the adjudicative \nguidelines \u201csolely on the basis of polygraph examination technical calls.\u201d AG \u00b6 1(c) (emphasis \nadded). As a practical matter, the admission of this evidence over objection, even under DOHA\u2019s \nrelaxed evidentiary rules, requires thorough inquiry,14 which we need not address in this matter, \nhaving already addressed the proper exclusion of Applicant\u2019s private polygraph on other grounds. \nAGA\u2019s Polygraphs \nWe turn finally to Applicant\u2019s argument that the Judge gave undue weight to the AGA \npolygraph reports and that those reports do not establish the Government\u2019s case by substantial \nevidence. The Government\u2019s case relied largely on Government Exhibit (GE) 2, which includes \nthe adjudication file from the AGA. That file includes the polygraphers\u2019 reports from four different \npolygraph sessions, in which they detail the pretest and post-test interview discussions and the \nsubsequent analysis of those reports by AGA personnel, which ultimately resulted in revocation \nof Applicant\u2019s SCI access in March 2012. Although the reports are summaries of what Applicant \ndisclosed in the interviews, they are detailed and reflect evolving disclosures and admissions over \nthe course of the four examinations. Notably, the summaries include significant and specific details \nabout Applicant\u2019s history of viewing child pornography that the Judge elected not to include in his \nfindings of fact. Applicant denies that he made the admissions that are reflected in those reports. \nAlthough the Judge characterized Applicant\u2019s claim to be that the polygraphers misinterpreted his \nstatements, Applicant is arguing on appeal that the polygraphers actually misrepresented his \nanswers and submitted \u201cfalse\u201d statements in their reports. Appeal Brief at 2, 9, 12, 17. Applicant \nacknowledges that he has \u201cno evidence that all three examiners worked together to make the \nconsistent allegations,\u201d but he nevertheless asserts that the \u201cchief adjudicator\u201d at the AGA \u201cwas \ndirecting all three examiners behind the doors.\u201d Id. at 14. \nWe have considered Applicant\u2019s arguments in light of the record as a whole and find them \nunpersuasive. First, his argument that the polygraphers\u2019 reports are not \u201creal evidence\u201d and cannot \nestablish the Government\u2019s case is without merit. Applicant did not object to the admission of GE \n2 but now argues that it should be given no weight, in part because he did not sign the summarized \n13 Additionally, the dicta found in the 2015 decision\u2019s footnote misstates and thereby inadvertently broadens the dicta \nfrom the relied-upon 2006 decision, which itself cites dicta from a Supreme Court decision. Compare ISCR Case No. \n02-31428 at 4 (merely acknowledging the differences between polygraph admissions and results and citing Wyrick v. \nFields for its dicta that \u201cthe results of the polygraph examination might not have been admissible evidence\u201d under \nMissouri law. 459 U.S. 42, 48 n.* (1982) (emphasis added), with ISCR Case No. 15-07539 at 5, n.3 (\u201cStatements \nmade in response to questioning during a polygraph examination are admissible, although the results of the exam itself \nare not\u201d.). \n14 See ISCR Case No. 96-0785 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Sep. 3, 1998) (identifying non-exhaustive factors to be considered in \njudge\u2019s determination of the admissibility and weight of polygraph results). \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nreports and because the videotapes of the interviews were not provided. Id. at 17. Those facts were \ncertainly proper matters for the Judge to consider in determining how much weight to give the \npolygraphers\u2019 reports. He ultimately determined that the reports established the allegations by \nsubstantial evidence, which we have frequently defined as more than a scintilla but less than a \npreponderance of the evidence. That conclusion is amply supported by the record. \nSecond, we are not persuaded by Applicant\u2019s allegation that the polygraphers made false \nstatements in summarizing his interviews and that the senior AGA adjudicator somehow \ncoordinated the submission of false reports. Our review of the polygraphers\u2019 reports and \nsubsequent analysis by AGA personnel confirms that those documents are thorough, internally \nconsistent, and contain nothing that would lead one to question the motives of those who prepared \nthem. Applicant offered no plausible reason for why three AGA polygraphers conducting their \nassigned duties would have made up the specific admissions reflected in GE 2 or why the senior \nadjudicator would have directed such an effort. Federal agencies and employees, including \npolygraphers, are entitled to a presumption of good faith and regularity in the performance of their \nduties. Sierra Club v. Costle, 657 F.2d 298, 334 (D.C. Cir. 1981); ISCR Case No. 07-17801 at 6\u00ad\n7 (App. Bd. Dec. 5, 2012). Applicant has presented no evidence to rebut that presumption, and our \nreview of the record reveals no such evidence.  \nThird, in several regards, the polygraphers\u2019 reports are corroborated by Applicant\u2019s \ntestimony. At hearing, he confirmed the following facts that are reflected in the reports: in the May \n2011 interview, he admitted viewing pornographic images of girls who appeared to be 12 or 13, \nalbeit inadvertently, and admitted searching for \u201cAsian Women\u201d or Asian Movie Stars\u201d while at \nwork; in the September 2011 interview, he gave the polygraphers the name of various websites he \nvisited, to include hardcorejunkie; and, in the October 2011 interview, he admitted that he had \naccidentally opened images of nude girls who appeared to be between 13 and 15 and admitted to \nwithholding this information during his earlier interviews. Tr. at 44\u201355. Viewed as a whole and in \nlight of the entire record, GE 2 supports a reasonable conclusion that the statements attributed to \nApplicant summarize what he actually disclosed.  \nThe remainder of Applicant\u2019s appeal reiterates his denial of any admissions regarding child \npornography and is effectively a challenge to the Judge\u2019s credibility assessment \u2014 that is, the \nJudge\u2019s decision to give more weight to the polygraphers\u2019 reports than to Applicant\u2019s denials and \nletters of support. Our review of this record gives us no reason to disturb the Judge\u2019s credibility \ndetermination. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1 (\u201c[T]he Appeal Board shall give deference to the credibility \ndeterminations of the Administrative Judge\u201d). \nConclusion \nApplicant has not established that the Judge committed harmful error. The record reflects \nthat the Judge examined the relevant evidence, weighed the disqualifying and mitigating evidence, \nand articulated a satisfactory explanation for the decision. The record is sufficient to support that \nthe Judge\u2019s findings and conclusions are sustainable. \u201cThe general standard is that a clearance may \nbe granted only when \u2018clearly consistent with the interests of the national security.\u2019\u201d Department \nof the Navy v.
