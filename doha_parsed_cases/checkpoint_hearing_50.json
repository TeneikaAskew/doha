Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.\nHistory of Case\nOn January 31, 2018, the Department of Defense (DOD) Consolidated\nAdjudications Facility (CAF) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing reasons\nwhy DOD adjudicators could not make the affirmative determination of eligibility for a\nsecurity clearance, and recommended referral to an administrative judge to determine\nwhether a security clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked. The\naction was taken under Executive Order (Exec. Or) 10865, Safeguarding Classified\nInformation Within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6,\nDefense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as\namended (Directive); and Security Executive Agent, Directive 4, National Security\nAdjudicative Guidelines (SEAD) 4), effective June 8, 2017.\n03/22/2019\n\nApplicant responded to the SOR on July 10, 2018, and requested a hearing.  The\ncase was assigned to me on January 9, 2019, and was scheduled for hearing on\nFebruary 14, 2019. A hearing was convened as scheduled, for the purpose of\nconsidering whether it would be clearly consistent with the national interest to grant,\ncontinue, deny, or revoke Applicant\u2019s security clearance.  At hearing, the Government's\ncase consisted of three exhibits; Applicant relied on one witness (himself) and no \nexhibits. The transcript (Tr.) was received on February 26, 2019.\n     \nProcedural Issues\nBefore the close of the hearing, Applicant requested the record be kept open to\npermit him the opportunity to supplement the record with an updated psychological\nevaluation. For good cause shown, Applicant was granted 14 days to supplement the\nrecord. Department Counsel was afforded two days to respond. Within the time\npermitted, Applicant submitted an email explanation from his facility security officer\n(FSO) of her understanding of Applicant\u2019s mental health condition, while crediting him\nwith being a true patriot. Applicant\u2019s submission was admitted as AE A without\nobjection.\nSummary of Pleadings\nUnder Guideline I, Applicant allegedly (a) was diagnosed with Bipolar Affective\nDisorder in about February 2010 and failed to follow his prescribed treatment plan by\ndiscontinuing a prescribed medication and (b) was diagnosed with Bipolar I Disorder,\nsevere, with anxious distress, with mood-congruent psychotic features, in full remission,\nin about January 2018, and with a prognosis considered to be guarded due to a lack of\npersonal insight into his symptoms and his non-compliance with his primary care\nphysician\u2019s recommendation that he reestablish care with a psychiatrist.\nIn his response to the SOR, Applicant admitted the allegations covered by SOR \u00b6\n1.a, but denied the allegations covered by SOR \u00b6 1.b. He claimed to have discontinued\nhis treatment in 2010 for two reasons: The medication was making him uncomfortable\nand he lacked confidence in his provider. He claimed that he found another provider,\nwith the help of his primary provider, whom he was closer to and better connected with,\nwho prescribed more soothing medication. He further claimed that this second doctor\nlater shut down his practice due to a lawsuit. \nApplicant claimed in his response that he went back to his primary provider for\nguidance in finding a new psychiatrist, and that he found a new psychiatrist who treated\nhim for one session before moving on. He claimed that he has a new provider\nscheduled that he is scheduled to see in July 2018.\nApplicant acknowledged having some physical ailments from sports, coaching,\nindustry, and construction, and sometimes suffers from lower back pain in the L-5 area.\nHe claimed that when he would cease using prescribed medication for his Bipolar\ndisorder, his nerve inflation would subside. And he claimed that he experienced\ndifficulties connecting with his provider and convincing him of his reported experiences\n2\n\nwith his medications. Applicant reported in his response hat he suffered frm Guillen-\nBarre Syndrome in 1984 that affected his ability to physically function.\nFindings of Fact\nApplicant is a 63-year-old janitor floor specialist who seeks a security clearance.\nApplicant\u2019s admitted allegations are adopted as relevant and material findings. \nAdditional findings follow.\nBackground\nAppellant married in August 1980 and has two adult children from this marriage.\n(GE 1) He attended an accredited college between 1974 and 1978, but did not earn a\ndiploma. While an undergraduate student, he played varsity baseball. Applicant\nreported no military service. \nSince July 2008, Applicant has worked for his current employer. (GE 1) Between\nMarch 2000 and December 2000, he  worked for other employers. He has worked\ncontemporaneously for another employer since May 2011 as an inventory control\nspecialist, and between July 2008 and January 2011, he was self-employed. (GE 1)\nApplicant\u2019s mental health history  \nApplicant presents with a lengthy history of mental health issues. (GEs 2-3) In\nFebruary 2010, he was referred to a mental health provider to assess his mental health\nsymptoms. (GE 2; Tr. 54) After taking personal information from Applicant, Dr. A (a\nlicensed psychiatrist) entered an uncertain diagnosis, but suspected Bipolar Affective\nDisorder. (GE 2) At this time, Dr. A offered Applicant a trial of anti-psychotic medications\n(Lamictol and Lithium in various doses) and scheduled him for a return visit in March\n2010. (GE 2) Dr. A\u2019s notes document that Applicant consulted with him on five\noccasions between February 2010 and April 2011. (GEs 2-3) While Applicant did not\nsee Dr. A after his last visit in April 2011, he continued to take his prescribed\nmedications for several months thereafter before he ceased altogether. (GEs 2-3; Tr.\n32-34) \nWith the help of his primary medical provider, Applicant engaged another mental\nhealth provider, who he was closer to and better connected with. Between Fall 2013\nand January 2015, Applicant consulted with Dr. B (a licensed psychiatrist) on several\noccasions during this time frame. Dr. B prescribed a different medication: Depakote\n(100 mg). (GEs 2-3; Tr. 33-34, 61-62) He ceased seeing Dr. B after learning that Dr. B\nretired after being sued by a patient and losing his license in 2015. (GE 2; Tr. 62)\nThroughout most of 2015, Applicant continued to take his prescribed Depakote\nintermittently with the advice of another recommended mental health provider (Dr. C),\nwhom Applicant consulted with on only one occasion in 2018.  (Tr. 66) For over two\nyears (2016-2018) Applicant did not consult with a mental health provider or take his\nprescribed Depakote or any other medications designed to address any experienced\nBipolar symptoms on more than an intermittent basis. (GEs 2-3; Tr. 62-63, 66-67)  Only\n3\n\nthrough the influence of his daughter did Applicant return to his medications\nintermittently. (Tr. 63-64)\nIn January 2018, Applicant was referred by the DOD CAF to Dr. D (a licensed\npsychiatrist) for a mental health evaluation. (GE 3) After taking psychiatric history from\nApplicant, Dr. D conducted a mental health examination of him. (GE 3) Results of Dr.\nD\u2019s personality assessment revealed that Applicant answered the questions in a\nmanner where he was trying to portray himself in a positive light that was extreme, even\nfor the evaluative nature of the interview. (GE 3; Tr. 38-39, 62-63) According to Dr. D\u2019s\nobservations, Applicant minimized and denied common shortcomings or minor faults in\na way that likely indicated he was in denial of these issues with little awareness of the\nnegative impact that his actions had on himself or others. (GE 3) Because of Applicant\u2019s\nabnormally high level of minimizing and the defensive nature of his responses, Dr. D\ncould not reliably extrapolate from his assessment any further details. (GE 3)\nBased on his observations of Applicant, Dr. D ruled out Applicant experiencing \nany symptoms of mania. (GE 3) He did, however, draw historical diagnostic impressions\nof Applicant\u2019s experiencing manic episodes, amid reported concerns from Applicant\u2019s\ndaughter about Applicant\u2019s disposition to decompensate quickly if he misses a\nmedication dosage or is non-compliant with his medication regimen. (GE 3) Based on\nhis  diagnostic impressions of Applicant, Dr. D diagnosed him with Bipolar I Disorder,\nsevere, with anxious distress, with mood-congruent psychotic features, in full remission. \n(GE 3)\nDr. D, in turn, assigned a prognosis of Applicant that the latter\u2019s viability to hold a\nsecurity clearance is dependent on his ability to be fully compliant and stable on an\neffective medication regimen. (GE 3) Based on Dr. D\u2019s review and understanding of the\navailable medical documentation, collateral information gained, and Applicant\u2019s own\nadmission, it was clear to Dr. D that Applicant did not fully grasp the consequences of\nhis previous episodes and that his compliance is due to family pressure rather than\npersonal insight, awareness building, and a desire to prevent further episodes or the\nconsequences that they cause. (GE 3) \nDr. D Is on record in expressing particular concern about Applicant\u2019s past\nunwillingness to promptly follow up on his primary care provider\u2019s recommendation to\nreconnect with a psychiatrist, which, in Dr. D\u2019s judgment, calls into question his\ncommitment to the treatment plan. Noting few safeguards in place to guarantee or\naccurately predict whether Applicant\u2019s current stability is sustainable, Dr. D determined\nthat Applicant\u2019s judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness to safeguard or handle\nclassified information is promising, but only if he is compliant with his medications. (GE\n3) \nSince his submitting to a psychological evaluation in January 2018, it remains to\nbe seen how Applicant has complied with his medication regimen. The information he\nprovided at his hearing is very limited and includes no documented notes or records of\nwhat medications he is currently taking and in what doses. While Applicant has engaged\nanother psychiatrist (Dr. C) in July 2018 to help him manage his medications, to date,\n4\n\nhe has seen this mental health provider only once and has not provided any evidence of\na diagnosis, prescribed medications, or prognosis from Dr. C. that could help to assess\nApplicant\u2019s current condition and adherence to his prescribed medications. In the\nmeantime, Applicant continues to self-medicate with Depakote. (Tr. 47-48)\nCharacter references\nApplicant is well-regarded by his facility security officer (FSO) who considers him\na true patriot. (AE A) She expressed awareness of Applicant\u2019s medical condition and, in\nparticular, two episodes she knows of where he \u201cbecame a little unbalanced and both\ntimes he was put on short term disability by his doctor.\u201d (AE A) His FSO acknowledged\nthat had she known what she knows now, she probably would not have wanted to take\nthe risk and put him in for a security clearance. (AE A) No other character references\nwere furnished by Applicant.\nPolicies\nThe AGs list guidelines to be used by administrative judges in the decision-\nmaking process covering DOHA cases. These guidelines take into account factors that\ncould create a potential conflict of interest for the individual applicant, as well as\nconsiderations that could affect the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to\nprotect classified information. These guidelines include conditions that could raise a\nsecurity concern and may be disqualifying (disqualifying conditions), if any, and many of\nthe conditions that could mitigate security concerns. These guidelines must be\nconsidered before deciding whether or not a security clearance should be granted,\ncontinued, or denied. The guidelines do not require administrative judges to place\nexclusive reliance on the enumerated disqualifying and mitigating conditions in the\nguidelines in arriving at a decision. Each of the guidelines is to be evaluated in the\ncontext of the whole person in accordance with AG \u00b6 2(c) \nIn addition to the relevant AGs, administrative judges must take into account the\npertinent considerations for assessing extenuation and mitigation set forth in AG \u00b6 2(a)\nof the revised AGs, which are intended to assist the judges in reaching a fair and\nimpartial commonsense decision based upon a careful consideration of the pertinent\nguidelines within the context of the whole person. The adjudicative process is designed\nto examine a sufficient period of an applicant\u2019s life to enable predictive judgments to be\nmade about whether the applicant is an acceptable security risk. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s conduct, the relevant guidelines are to be\nconsidered together with the following AG \u00b6 2(a) factors: (1) the nature, extent, and\nseriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include\nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which\nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other\npermanent behavioral chances; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for\npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or\nrecurrence.\n5\n\nOnce the Government meets its initial burden of proof of establishing admitted or\ncontroverted facts, the evidentiary burden shifts to the applicant for the purpose of\nestablishing his or her security worthiness through evidence of refutation, extenuation,\nor mitigation.  Based on the requirement of  Exec. Or. 10865 that all security clearances\nbe clearly consistent with the national interest, the applicant has the ultimate burden of\ndemonstrating his or her clearance eligibility. \u201c[S]ecurity-clearance determinations\nshould err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d See Department of the Navy v. Egan,\n484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988).  And because all security clearances must be clearly\nconsistent with the national interest, the burden of persuasion must remain with the\nApplicant.\nViewing the issues raised and evidence as a whole, the following adjudication\npolicy concerns are pertinent herein\n     \nPsychological Conditions\nThe Concern. Certain emotional, mental, and personality conditions can\nimpair judgment, reliability, or trustworthiness. A formal diagnosis of a\ndisorder is not required for there to be a concern under this guideline. A\nduly qualified mental health professional (e.g., a clinical psychologist or\npsychiatrist) employed by, or acceptable to and approved by the U.S.\nGovernment, should be consulted when evaluating potentially disqualifying\nand mitigating information under this guideline and an opinion, including\nprognosis, should be sought. No negative inference concerning the\nstandards in this guideline may be raised solely on the basis of mental\nhealth counseling.\nBurden of Proof\nBy virtue of the principles and policies framed by the AGs, a decision to grant or\ncontinue an applicant's security clearance may be made only upon a threshold finding\nthat to do so is clearly consistent with the national interest.  Because the Directive\nrequires administrative judges to make a commonsense appraisal of the evidence\naccumulated in the record, the ultimate determination of an applicant's eligibility for a\nsecurity clearance depends, in large part, on the relevance and materiality of that\nevidence. See United States v. Gaudin, 515 U.S. 506, 509-511 (1995). As with all\nadversarial proceedings, the judge may draw only those inferences which have a\nreasonable and logical basis from the evidence of record. \nThe Government's initial burden is twofold: (1) it must prove by substantial\nevidence any controverted facts alleged in the SOR, and (2) it must demonstrate that\nthe facts proven have a material bearing to the applicant's eligibility to obtain or\nmaintain a security clearance. The required materiality showing, however, does not\nrequire the Government to affirmatively demonstrate that the applicant has actually\nmishandled or abused classified information before it can deny or revoke a security\nclearance. Rather, the judge must consider and weigh the cognizable risks that an\napplicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information.\n6\n\nOnce the Government meets its initial burden of proof of establishing admitted\nor controverted facts, the evidentiary burden shifts to the applicant for the purpose of\nestablishing his or her security worthiness through evidence of refutation, extenuation,\nor mitigation. Based on the requirement of  Exec. Or. 10865 that all security clearances\nbe clearly consistent with the national interest, the applicant has the ultimate burden of\ndemonstrating his or her clearance eligibility. \u201c[S]ecurity-clearance determinations\nshould err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d See Department of the Navy v. Egan,\n484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988).  Because all security clearances must be clearly consistent\nwith the national interest, the burden of persuasion must remain with the Applicant.\nAnalysis\nApplicant is a civilian janitor floor specialist who seeks a security clearance. \nSecurity concerns are raised over his past history of diagnosed Bipolar Affective\nDisorder in 2010 and Bipolar 1 Disorder with anxious distress with mood-congruent\npsychotic features in 2018.\nPsychological condition concerns\nSince 2010, Applicant has undergone several mental health evaluation for\nBipolar-related issues with licensed mental health providers: three self-referred (Drs. A-\nB and D), and one directed by Applicant\u2019s command (Dr. C). Applicant\u2019s evaluators all\nreached similar conclusions with their respective diagnoses and prognoses and are\nfully reconcilable. All three psychiatric evaluators found indicia of Bipolar traits of\nlongstanding duration in their assessments of Applicant.\nIn their coverage of Applicant\u2019s background history, Drs. A-B and D found \nevidence of a defect in judgment and reliability in Appellant\u2019s case history without \nconsidering him unsuitable for holding a security clearance, providing he complied with\nhis medication regimens prescribed by his treating mental health providers. See DSM-\nV. For obvious reasons, any loss of mental grasp and judgment in times of stress\nplaces the affected person at some risk to overreactions to stimuli and consequential\nmisjudgments and cannot be discounted. \nFor Applicant, his potential for relapse of symptoms (e.g., mood swings)\nassociated with his Bipolar Disorder with attendant risks of judgment lapses (even if not\nsufficiently developed along any of the DSM-5 classification categories to warrant\nclearly identifiable and calibrated stressors) can create hypothetical potential in the\nopinion of his evaluators for exposing him to security risks to inadvertently compromise\nclassified materials in his custody or control, consistent with the requirements of the\nDSM-V. Based on the recent assessments of Drs. A-C, two disqualifying conditions\ncovered by the psychological conditions guideline are applicable to Appellant\u2019s\nsituation: DC \u00b6\u00b6 28(a), \u201cbehavior that casts doubt on an individual\u2019s judgment,\nreliability, or trustworthiness, not covered under any other guideline and that may\nindicate an emotional, mental, or personalty condition, including, but not limited to,\nirresponsible, violent, self-harm, suicidal, paranoid, manipulative, impulsive, chronic,\nlying, deceitful, exploitative, or bizarre behaviors\u201d:  28(b), \u201can opinion by a duly qualified\n7\n\nmental health professional that the individual has a condition that may impair judgment,\nstability, reliability, or trustworthiness.\u201d\nBased on the reconciled assessments of Applicant\u2019s recent evaluators (Drs. A-\nC), Applicant may claim some benefits of one of the potentially available mitigating\nconditions covered by Guideline. MC \u00b6 29(b), \u201cthe individual has voluntarily entered a\ncounseling or treatment program for a condition that is amenable to treatment, and the\nindividual is currently receiving counseling or treatment with a favorable prognosis by a\nduly qualified mental health professional,\u201d is partially applicable to Applicant\u2019s situation. \nWithout more evidence of follow-up treatment and counseling to ensure\nApplicant\u2019s compliance with the medication regimens prescribed for him by Dr. B, and\npossibly Dr. D, full application of any of the potentially available mitigating conditions is\nreserved pending updates of his mental health evaluations. To date, Applicant has not\nprovided any evaluation updates from Dr. D or any other licensed psychiatrist. Nor has\nhe provided probative reassurances of his continued compliance with prescribed\nmedication regimens. Without confirmation of Applicant\u2019s continuing compliance with\nhis prescribed medication regimen, safe predictions cannot be made about his ability to\nwithstand recurrent Bipolar symptoms that can adversely affect his judgment, reliability,\nand trustworthiness.  \nWhole-person assessment\nBased on a whole-person assessment of Applicant\u2019s current judgment,\nreliability, and trustworthiness, taking into account all of Applicant\u2019s developed personal\nhistories, diagnostic impressions reach by his professional evaluators, diagnoses,\nassessments, and prognoses compiled by the mental health professionals who\nevaluated Applicant, Applicant cannot be reliably predicted at this time to be able to\nsustain the medication compliance that is required to maintain his diagnosed Bipolar\ncondition in remission. \nApplicant is well regarded by his FSO who characterized him as a true patriot.\nBut despite the high praise she extended to him, she could not state with conviction\nthat his current condition could not affect his judgment reliability, and trustworthiness.\nPsychological condition concerns are not mitigated.\nFormal Findings\n   \nIn reviewing the allegations of the SOR in the context of the findings of fact,\nconclusions, and the factors and conditions listed above, I make the following separate\nformal findings with respect to Applicant's eligibility for a security clearance.\nGUIDELINE I (PSYCHOLOGICAL CONDITIONS): AGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.b:\n              Against Applicant\n8\n\nConclusions\n        In light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s security\nclearance.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact After a thorough review of the case file, I make the following findings of fact. Applicant is 62 years old. Applicant received a bachelor\u2019s degree in May 2000, and took additional college courses from January 2003 until November 2005. He did not receive an additional degree. He married the first time in 1980, had one child, and divorced in 1985. He married again in 1985 and had four children. Applicant and his wife separated briefly a number of times in their marriage and now have been separated since 2015. Applicant and his wife are trying to reconcile. He has four adult children from this marriage. Since separating from his wife, Applicant rented the basement of a town house where he and his special needs son reside. (Tr. 25-26, 35-38) Applicant served on active duty in the Army from March 1975 until April 1995. He retired as a First Sergeant (E-8) with an honorable discharge. After leaving active duty, he served as a minister for three years until approximately 2000. In February 2002, he started working with his present defense contractor employer as a mechanic. He was continually promoted and has been a production supervisor for the last ten years. Applicant\u2019s employer has been very supportive of him while he undergoes substance abuse rehabilitation, to care for his son, and the need to care for and bury his mother.

Davis, Esq. \n______________ \nDecision \n______________ \nCREAN, THOMAS M., Administrative Judge: \nApplicant did not provide sufficient documentary evidence to mitigate all financial, \nalcohol, and criminal conduct security concerns. Eligibility for access to classified \ninformation is denied. \nStatement of the Case \nApplicant submitted Electronic Questionnaires for Investigations Processing (e-\nQIP) on June 18, 2016 (Government Exhibit (GX) 1), and March 29, 2012 (GX 3), to \nobtain a security clearance required for a position with a defense contractor. He was \ngranted access to classified information after submission of the 2012 e-QIP. However, \nthe Department of Defense (DOD) could not make the affirmative findings required to \ncontinue his eligibility for access to classified information after he submitted his 2016 e-\nQIP. On June 28, 2017, DOD issued Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing \nsecurity concerns for alcohol consumption (Guideline G), criminal conduct (Guideline J), \nand financial considerations (Guideline F). DOD amended the SOR on October 17, \n2017, to more clearly outline the allegations under Guidelines G and J. The action was \ntaken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry \n(February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense \nIndustrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as \n12/17/2018\n\n2 \n \namended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) effective in the Department of \nDefense on June 8, 2017. \n \nApplicant answered the original SOR on July 19, 2017. He admitted the four \nfinancial allegations under Guideline F. He answered the amended SOR on October 25, \n2018, admitting the two allegations of alcohol consumption under Guideline G and the \none allegation of criminal conduct under Guideline J. Department Counsel was \nprepared to proceed on the original allegations on October 23, 2017, and the case was \nassigned to me April 13, 2018. DOD issued a notice of hearing on September 4, 2018, \nfor a hearing on September 19, 2018. Unfortunately, Applicant\u2019s mother passed away \non the day of the hearing. A new notice of hearing was issued on September 19, 2018, \nfor a hearing on November 1, 2018. I convened the hearing as rescheduled. \nDepartment Counsel introduced 17 documents which were admitted into the record \nwithout objection as Government Exhibits (GX) 1 to 17. Applicant introduced five \ndocuments admitted into the record without objection as Applicant Exhibit (AX) A to E. I \nkept the record open for Applicant to introduce additional documents. Applicant timely \nsubmitted six documents that I admitted without objection as AX F to K. (GX 18, e-mail, \ndated December 3, 2018) DOHA received a copy of the hearing transcript on November \n9, 2018. The record closed on December 3, 2018, upon receipt of all post-hearing \ndocuments.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nAfter a thorough review of the case file, I make the following findings of fact. \nApplicant is 62 years old. Applicant received a bachelor\u2019s degree in May 2000, and took \nadditional college courses from January 2003 until November 2005. He did not receive \nan additional degree. He married the first time in 1980, had one child, and divorced in \n1985. He married again in 1985 and had four children. Applicant and his wife separated \nbriefly a number of times in their marriage and now have been separated since 2015. \nApplicant and his wife are trying to reconcile. He has four adult children from this \nmarriage. Since separating from his wife, Applicant rented the basement of a town \nhouse where he and his special needs son reside. (Tr. 25-26, 35-38) \n \n \nApplicant served on active duty in the Army from March 1975 until April 1995. He \nretired as a First Sergeant (E-8) with an honorable discharge. After leaving active duty, \nhe served as a minister for three years until approximately 2000. In February 2002, he \nstarted working with his present defense contractor employer as a mechanic. He was \ncontinually promoted and has been a production supervisor for the last ten years. \nApplicant\u2019s employer has been very supportive of him while he undergoes substance \nabuse rehabilitation, to care for his son, and the need to care for and bury his mother. \n(Tr. 26-27; 33-36; GX 1, e-QIP, dated June 18, 2016; GX 3, e-QIP, dated March 29, \n2012) \n \nThe SOR alleges four financial security concerns under Guideline F; a Chapter 7 \nbankruptcy filed in November 2016 with debts discharged in March 2017 (SOR 1.a); a \nChapter 13 bankruptcy filed in July 2016 but dismissed in December 2016 (SOR 1.b); \n\n3 \n \nfederal income tax debt of approximately $45,773 for tax years 2009, and 2011 to 2015 \n(SOR 1.c); and a failure to file in a timely fashion federal tax returns for tax years 2009 \nthrough 2015 (SOR 1.d). Delinquent student loans are not alleged in the SOR as \nfinancial security concerns but are noted on credit reports (GX 4, dated May 9, 2017; \nGX 5, dated August 19, 2016; GX 6, dated September 2, 2014; and GX 7, dated April 3, \n2012). \n \nThe SOR alleges under alcohol consumption (Guideline G) that Applicant in \nOctober 2011 discharged a firearm from a moving vehicle after consuming alcohol. He \nwas sentenced to be incarcerated for 180 days with 165 days suspended. (SOR 2.a). \nThe SOR also alleges that after consuming alcohol Applicant was arrested for \nrecklessly handling a firearm, swearing in public and public intoxication. He was \nsentenced to probation for 12 months. (SOR 2.b) These offenses were also cross-\nalleged as criminal conduct. (SOR 3.a) Applicant admitted all allegations. (Answer to \nSOR, dated October 25, 2018) \n \nApplicant lived beyond his means while on active duty. He used credit cards sent \nto him in the mail to bolster his ability to purchase whatever he wanted. After leaving \nactive duty in 1995 and working as a minister, Applicant continued to have financial \nproblems caused by lack of sufficient income and living beyond his means. In 1997, \nApplicant and his second wife filed a Chapter 13 bankruptcy in an attempt to save their \nhouse. They were unable to make the required payments to the bankruptcy trustee, so \nthe bankruptcy was converted to a Chapter 7 bankruptcy. Their debts at the time were \ndischarged in the bankruptcy in 1997. His house was foreclosed in 2002. (Tr. 20-21, 35-\n37; GX 8 and 9, Bankruptcy Documents, 1997; GX 10, Foreclosure documents, dated \nMay 3, 2002; GX 11, Applicant\u2019s Statement, dated May 16, 2002) \n \nApplicant and his wife continued to have financial issues. They moved so he \ncould have a better job, but his wife could not find employment to provide sufficient \nincome for the family. He could not afford to buy a house so he rented one. Applicant\u2019s \nwife usually calculated, completed, and filed their tax returns. After a separation in \napproximately 2006 from his wife, Applicant did not file his federal income tax returns for \nsix years from approximately 2009 until 2015 because he knew he would owe about \n$6,000 each year in taxes that he could not afford to pay. His wife continued to file \nseparately. Starting in 2008, Applicant knew he would owe substantial federal taxes. He \nwas overwhelmed by his problems and did not focus on what he needed to do and did \nnot take care of his business. (Tr. 40-41, 73-75) \n \nIn 2012, Applicant went to a tax service and an attorney to resolve his taxes to no \navail. Starting in 2012, Applicant\u2019s pay was garnished by the Internal Revenue Service \n(IRS). After the IRS pay garnishment, Applicant\u2019s take-home pay was reduced to \napproximately $600 a month after garnishment. Applicant\u2019s car was repossessed, and \nhe and his family were evicted from the home they rented. Applicant and his wife \nseparated permanently in 2015. In 2016, Applicant was able to have a tax preparer file \nhis past-due tax returns. Applicant has continued to use this attorney to file his taxes. \n(Tr. 41-43) \n\n4 \n \nApplicant also contacted an attorney, and Applicant and his wife filed another \nChapter 13 bankruptcy that was later converted to a Chapter 7 bankruptcy. Their debts \nwere again discharged in 2017. (Tr. 21-23, 43-45; GX 2, Bankruptcy Documents)   \n \nApplicant was overwhelmed by his financial issues and the need to care for his \nspecial needs son. After the bankruptcy discharge, Applicant worked with a Certified \nPublic Accountant (CPA) to resolve the federal tax debt that remained from the \nbankruptcy discharge. With the help of the CPA, Applicant was able to have his \ndisabled son declared his dependent and his income restructured to minimize his tax \nliability. Instead of owing taxes, he received a tax refund that is applied to his tax debt. \nHis mother, who was located in another state, became sick and Applicant had to travel \nto help care for her. His mother passed away in September 2018. (Tr. 23-25, 35-38) \n \nApplicant filed his past-due federal tax returns in 2016. (AX F, G, and H, IRS Tax \nDocuments). He timely filed his 2016 and 2017 federal tax returns. (AX I and J, IRS Tax \nDocuments) After all of the tax returns were filed, the IRS determined that Applicant \nowed approximately $35,000 in back taxes. In April 2018, Applicant agreed to a \npayment plan of $425 a month with the ISR to pay back taxes. His payment amount will \nincrease in April 2019 to $595. No taxes were owed for tax years 2016 and 2017. He is \ncurrent with the IRS payment plan for past-due taxes for tax years 2010 to 2015. (Tr. \n49-52, 72-74) \n \nApplicant drank alcohol from approximately 1990 to 2000. He started drinking \nbecause he was a young soldier and just wanted to drink alcohol. He stopped drinking \nalcohol in 2000 because he entered the ministry becoming a pastor and did not want to \nbe seen consuming alcohol. He started drinking again in 2003 because he left the \nministry and there was no accountability for behavior, he was still having financial \nproblems, and he had lost his home. In 2010, his consumption of alcohol increased \nsubstantially for no reason except he and his wife were separated; his children had \nmoved back into his house; and he had issues caring for his mother who was in another \nstate. He was consuming from six to nine beers a day. He drank to deal with his \nproblems and his stress. Applicant sought substance abuse counseling. In 2015, he \nstarted to consult with a psychologist who he still periodically sees.  He last consumed \nalcohol on September 22, 2018, the day before his mother\u2019s funeral. The day before the \nhearing, he started a Veteran\u2019s Affairs (VA) Substance Abuse Rehabilitation Program \n(SARP) through his employer. He understands he has an issue with alcohol and needs \ntreatment. He stated that he does not intend to consume alcohol in the future. (Tr. 51-\n58, 75-78: AX A through D; VA Hospital staff assignments and schedule) \n \nIn October 2011, Applicant was separated from his wife and dating another \nwoman. He was consuming a few beers before the woman asked him to take her and \nher young daughter to run some errands. Since he had been drinking alcohol, he asked \nthe woman to drive. Applicant brought a handgun with him because the jurisdiction \nwhere they were located allowed the open carrying of handguns. Applicant and the \nwoman argued and Applicant became irritated. As they drove down a road, Applicant \nfired his gun out the window of the moving car. He apologized to the woman and gave \n\n5 \n \nher his gun. But she drove to a store to call the police. Applicant did not consider \nhimself intoxicated but he knew he was over the legal limit to drive. Applicant was \nconvicted of two counts of brandishing a weapon, served seven days in jail, and placed \non probation for six months. He completed the period of probation. He was monitored \nfor substance abuse while on probation. All tests were negative. (Tr. 59-65, 79-8; GX \n12, Police Report; GX 13, Court Record; GX 16, Incident Report; GX 17, Criminal \nHistory Report) \n \nApplicant had another incident with a weapon in 2015. By September 2015, his \nmother, who had been living with him, moved back to her home because Applicant was \nunable to care for her. Applicant also had problems with his special needs son, and the \nIRS was questioning him about his failure to file tax returns. Applicant was angry and \nfrustrated. He went outside and fired his gun into the air three times. On the day of the \nincident, Applicant consumed over a pint of alcohol. He was arrested and charged with \nreckless handling of a firearm and public intoxication. He was convicted and sentenced \nto twelve months of supervised probation. He wore an ankle bracelet from October 2015 \nuntil October 2016. He did not consume alcohol and successfully completed probation. \nHe no longer owes a firearm. However, he has continued to consume moderate \namounts of alcohol since ending his probation in October 2016. (Tr. 65-70, 80-81; GX \n14, Police Report; GX 15, Court Record; GX 16, Incident Report; GX 17, Criminal \nHistory Report)  \n \nApplicant presented a letter from a friend who is a psychologist and has known \nApplicant for over 25 years. The friend provided mentoring and counseling for Applicant. \nApplicant has been candid and transparent about the issues he has encountered \nincluding the death of his mother. He believes Applicant has taken the counseling he \nreceived to heart and is developing positive coping methods. He is resolving his \nfinancial issue and making restitution. He is taking strides to correct his past mistakes \nand entered substance abuse treatment. He is making efforts to reconcile with his wife. \nThe friend recommends that he be granted eligibility for access to classified information.  \n(AX E, Letter, dated October 31, 2018) \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the Administrative Guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s over-arching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \n\n6 \n \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by department counsel. . .\u201d The \napplicant has the burden of persuasion to obtaining a favorable security decision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \nAnalysis \n \nFinancial Considerations \n \n \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial obligations \nmay indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and \nregulations, all of which can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and ability to protect classified or sensitive information. An individual \nwho is financially irresponsible, may also be irresponsible, unconcerned, or careless in \nhis obligations to protect classified information. Behaving responsibly or irresponsibly in \none aspect of life provides an indication of how a person may behave in other aspects \nof life. An individual who is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in \nillegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. (AG \u00b6 18).  \n \n \nA person\u2019s relationship with his or her creditors is a private matter until evidence \nis uncovered demonstrating an inability or unwillingness to meet financial obligations. \nAbsent evidence of strong extenuating or mitigating circumstances, an applicant with a \nhistory of serious or recurring financial difficulties is in a situation of risk inconsistent \nwith the holding of a security clearance. An applicant is required to manage his or her \nfinances in such a way as to meet financial obligations.  \n\n7 \n \nApplicant filed for bankruptcy in July 2016 and his debts were discharged in \nMarch 2017. Applicant admits that he has an income tax debt to the United States of \napproximately $35,000 because he did not file income tax returns for six years for tax \nyear 2009 through 2015. This information is sufficient to raise security concerns under \nFinancial Considerations Disqualifying Conditions AG \u00b6 19: \n \n \n(a) inability to satisfy debts;  \n \n \n(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so; \n \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; \n \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or pay annual Federal., state, or local income taxes as \nrequired. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s tax debt caused by his failure to timely file federal tax returns exhibits \nan inability and unwillingness to satisfy debts and meet financial obligations. Once the \nGovernment has established the adverse financial issue, the Applicant has the \nresponsibility to refute or mitigate the issue. Based on the information provided by \nApplicant, I considered the following Financial Considerations Mitigating Conditions \nunder AG \u00b6 20: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problems were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g. loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce, or \nseparation, clear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity \ntheft), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem from \na legitimate and credible sources, such as a non-profit credit counselling \nservice, and there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved \nor is under control; and \n \n(d) the individual has initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to \nrepay the overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax \nauthority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements.  \n \n\n8 \n \n \nThe mitigating conditions only partially apply. Applicant presented no evidence \nthat he received financial counseling. However, an individual must establish that they \ncompleted a required financial counseling course for debts to be discharged in \nbankruptcy. Bankruptcy is a permissible and legal method of resolving debt, but it does \nnot show for security clearance purposes a good-faith effort to resolve debts. Applicant \nfiled a bankruptcy action in 2016 and his debts were discharged in 2017. The available \nevidence shows that Applicant filed a Chapter 13 bankruptcy in July 2016 that was \nconverted to a Chapter 7 bankruptcy in November 2016. Applicant\u2019s debts were \ndischarged in March 2017. Applicant\u2019s bankruptcy action in 2016/2017 does not equate \nto a security concern.  \n \n \nThe information provided by Applicant shows that he has now filed the tax \nreturns and his tax debt is being resolved. However, there is a more fundamental issue \nfor security clearance purposes in not timely filing tax returns. Applicant admits he did \nnot timely file his federal tax returns because he did not have the funds to pay the taxes. \nThe lack of funds to pay taxes does not relieve a person from timely filing tax returns. \nApplicant\u2019s lack of action to file the returns resulted in his financial problems being \nongoing and recent, and not incurred under circumstances making recurrence unlikely.  \n \nApplicant has shown his recent good-faith efforts to meet his tax and financial \nobligations by agreeing to a payment plan with the IRS. Good faith means acting in a \nway that shows reasonableness, prudence, honesty, and adherence to duty and \nobligation. Applicant must act responsibly given his circumstances, and show that he \nhas a reasonable plan to resolve financial problems, and that he has taken significant \naction to implement that plan. Applicant\u2019s plan must show a systematic method of \nhandling financial obligations, and a meaningful track record of filing tax returns and \nresolving debts. A meaningful track record of tax return filing and resolving debt can be \nestablished by evidence of actually filing tax returns and establishing a plan to pay \ndebts. A promise to file tax returns and pay debts is not a substitute for a track record of \nfiling returns in a timely manner and acting in a financially responsible manner.  \n \nApplicant provided sufficient evidence that he filed his federal tax returns for tax \nyears 2009 through 2015 in 2016. All of these tax returns were filed late and not when \ndue. Failure to timely file tax returns suggests that an applicant has a problem \ncomplying with well-established governmental rules and systems. It is well known that \nfederal tax returns for a particular tax year are to be filed by April 15 of the following \nyear. Voluntary compliance with government rules and systems is essential for \nprotecting classified and sensitive information. A person who fails to fulfill his or her \nlegal obligation to timely file tax returns does not demonstrate the high degree of good \njudgment and reliability required for a grant of access to classified or sensitive \ninformation. An applicant\u2019s failure to timely file tax returns is a strong indication that the \nindividual may not follow the rules and guidance concerning safeguarding classified and \nsensitive information.  \n \n \nApplicant is now paying his past-due taxes, so AG \u00b6 20(g) applies. Even though \nApplicant has corrected the tax return problem and is paying his past-due taxes, there \n\n9 \n \nmust still be careful consideration of Applicant\u2019s trustworthiness in view of his \nlongstanding prior behavior evidencing irresponsibility by failing to timely file income tax \nreturns. Applicant did not timely file his tax returns because he did not have the funds to \npay the taxes due. There are procedures available to a taxpayer to file tax returns even \nif they do not have the funds available to pay the taxes. Applicant did not follow the \nestablished government rules and procedures and contact federal tax authorities for \nhelp to understand the actions he must take. He just simply failed to file the tax returns. \nBy failing to timely file federal tax returns for at least six years, Applicant did not \ndemonstrate the high degree of good judgment and reliability required of persons \ngranted access to classified or sensitive information  \n \n \nIt is a requirement of good citizenship to timely file income tax returns. The fact \nthat he did not timely file returns indicates that Applicant was not acting responsibly and \nreliably. Applicant did not provide sufficient assurance that his tax filing problems are \nresolved, under control, and will not recur in the future. His lack of reasonable and \nresponsible actions towards his tax returns are a strong indication that he may not \nprotect and safeguard classified or sensitive information. Under all these circumstances, \nApplicant failed to mitigate financial security concerns.  \n \nAlcohol Consumption \n \nExcessive alcohol consumption is a security concern because it often leads to \nthe exercise of questionable judgment or the failure to control impulses, and can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness. (AG \u00b6 21)  \n \nApplicant was arrested for two incidents of firing a weapon after consuming \nalcohol in dangerous circumstances within four years. Available evidence shows \nApplicant continues to consume alcohol. Applicant\u2019s alcohol-related arrests, and his \ncontinued consumption of alcohol are sufficient to establish the following Alcohol \nConsumption Disqualifying Condition under AG \u00b6 22(a) (Alcohol-related incidents away \nfrom work, such as driving while under the influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, \ndisturbing the peace, or other incidents of concern, regardless of the frequency of the \nindividual\u2019s alcohol use or whether the individual has been diagnosed with alcohol use \ndisorder).  \n \n \nI considered the following Alcohol Consumption Mitigating Conditions under AG \u00b6 \n23: \n \n(a) so much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, \nor good judgment;  \n \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her pattern of maladaptive alcohol \nuse, provides evidence of action taken to overcome this problem, and has \n\n10 \n \ndemonstrated a clear and established pattern of modified consumption or \nabstinence in accordance with treatment recommendations; and \n \n(c) the individual is participating in counseling or treatment program, has \nno previous history of treatment and relapse, and is making satisfactory \nprogress in a treatment program. \n \nWhile there is no \"bright line\" rule for determining when conduct is recent or \nsufficient time has passed since the incidents, a determination whether past conduct \naffects an individual's present reliability and trustworthiness must be based on a careful \nevaluation of the totality of the evidence. If the evidence shows a significant period of \ntime has passed without evidence of an alcohol issue, there must be an evaluation \nwhether that period of time demonstrates changed circumstances or conduct sufficient \nto indicate a finding of reform or rehabilitation.  \n \n \nApplicant was convicted of two incidents of criminally firing a weapon after \nconsuming alcohol in 2011 and 2015. Applicant stated that he entered a VA substance \nabuse program the day before the hearing. He also admitted that he continues to \nconsume alcohol.  \n \n \nApplicant has not presented sufficient evidence to establish a pattern of \nabstinence and has not shown sufficient evidence of action taken to overcome his \nalcohol consumption problems. He did not present any evidence of participation in on-\ngoing programs such as Alcoholics Anonymous. He admits that he has and continues to \nconsume alcohol. Accordingly, Applicant has not presented sufficient evidence to show \na change of circumstance. He has not established that he can now control his alcohol \nconsumption impulses. The evidence does not show that Applicant has been reformed \nor rehabilitated. I find that Applicant has not mitigated security concerns for alcohol \nconsumption. \n \nCriminal Conduct \n \n \nCriminal activity creates doubt about a person\u2019s judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person\u2019s ability or willingness \nto comply with laws, rules, and regulations (AG \u00b6 30). Applicant\u2019s admitted criminal \nconvictions were verified by criminal justice reports. Applicant admits that alcohol \nconsumption was a cause of his criminal activity gun offenses. These criminal acts raise \nthe following Criminal Conduct Disqualifying Conductions under AG \u00b6 31: \n(a) a single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses; and \n \n(b) allegations or admissions of criminal conduct, regardless of whether \nthe person was formally charged, formally prosecuted or convicted.  \n \n \nI considered the following Criminal Conduct Mitigating Conditions under AG \u00b6 32: \n \n\n11 \n \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur \nand does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or \ngood judgment; and \n \n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation, including but not limited \nto the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, remorse or \nrestitution, job training or higher education, good employment record, or \nconstructive community involvement. \n  \n \nNone of the mitigating conditions apply. Applicant has been involved in weapons-\nrelated criminal activity in 2011 and 2015. These offenses did not happen under \nunusual circumstances, and the last offense happened only approximately three years \nago. Since Applicant still is consuming alcohol, the offenses may likely recur. There was \nno pressure to commit any of the offenses, and they appear to be voluntary. The only \nevidence of rehabilitation is the potential passage of a few years and Applicant no \nlonger having a gun. The evidence of criminal conduct adversely affects Applicant\u2019s \njudgment, reliability, and trustworthiness and leads to the conclusion that he cannot or \nwill not comply with laws, rules, and regulations. Applicant has not presented sufficient \ninformation to mitigate criminal conduct security concerns.  \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \n \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I considered the opinion of \nApplicant\u2019s friend that Applicant faced many challenges in recent years leading to his \nalcohol issues and financial problems. Applicant admitted his alcohol-related offenses \nand his delinquent debts. Applicant\u2019s conduct in failing to timely file his income tax \n\n12 \n \nreturns coupled with two criminal incidents of the wrongful discharge of a firearm after \nconsuming alcohol show irresponsible conduct and poor judgment. Overall, these facts \nleave me with questions and doubts about Applicant\u2019s judgment, reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and eligibility and suitability for access to classified information. For all \nthese reasons, I conclude that Applicant has not mitigated alcohol consumption, \ncriminal conduct and financial considerations security concerns.

In a response signed on September 5, \n2015, and supplemented between September 11, 2015, and September 15, 2015, he \nadmitted four of the five allegations raised. He also requested a determination based on \nthe written record in lieu of a hearing. In the interim, Applicant\u2019s employer ceased \nsponsoring Applicant for a security clearance in 2014 due to downsizing, thereby \neliminating this body\u2019s jurisdiction over the matter.  \nIn early 2018, Applicant was rehired by the same entity and again sponsored for \na security clearance, so processing of this case resumed. 1  On February 26, 2018, the \nGovernment issued a File of Relevant Material (FORM) with six attachments (\u201cItems\u201d). \nApplicant\u2019s March 26, 2018, response to the FORM was received on April 4, 2018, and \naccepted into the record without objection. The case was assigned to me on May 17, \n2018. A request to introduce supplemental material was made by Applicant. After the \n1 This action was taken was considered under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial \nPersonnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the \nadjudicative guidelines (AG) effective within the DOD on or after June 8, 2017. \n04/06/2018\n\n \n \n \n \n2 \nGovernment expressed no objection, a recommendation on Applicant\u2019s behalf was \naccepted into the record on September 6, 2018. The record was then closed. Based on \nmy review of the case file and submissions, I find Applicant failed to mitigate security \nconcerns. \n \nRequest for Administrative Notice  \n \nDepartment Counsel requested that I take administrative notice of certain facts \nabout The Islamic Republic of Afghanistan (Afghanistan) and The Russian Federation \n(Russia). With no objection to the inclusion of these materials, I have taken \nadministrative notice of the facts contained within those requests. Selected facts from \nthose sources are reflected below.   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   Findings of Fact \n \nAfghanistan \n \nAfghanistan is an Islamic Republic with a directly elected president, a bicameral \nlegislative branch, and a judicial branch. Afghanistan remains an important partner with \nthe United States against terrorism. Afghanistan works with the U.S. to eliminate the \nremnants of al-Qaeda and its affiliates. The U.S. continues to invest U.S. resources to \nhelp Afghanistan improve its security, governance, institutions and economy. The \nUnited States\u2019 strong bilateral relationship with Afghanistan is guided by the Enduring \nStrategic Partnership Agreement (SPA) between Afghanistan and the United States \nsigned in May 2012, which lays out economic and political commitments, as well as by \nthe 2014 Bilateral Security Agreement, which lays out mutual security understandings. \nIn July 2012, Afghanistan was designated a Major Non-NATO ally.  \n \nThe U.S. has engaged in on-going conflicts in Afghanistan since 2001. While \nthere has been a drawdown in the number of U.S. troops in Afghanistan, troops now \ntrain Afghan forces. U.S. forces continue to disrupt and degrade al-Qaeda and Islamic \nState activities in Afghanistan through partnered operations with Afghanistan, as well as \nunilateral operations. It is a U.S. priority to rid Afghanistan of terrorism.   \n \nThe U.S. Department of State, however, issued a travel advisory warning U.S. \ncitizens not to travel to Afghanistan because of continued instability and threats by \nterrorist organizations against U.S. citizens. Afghanistan also has significant human \nrights problems to include extrajudicial killings by security forces, ineffective government \ninvestigations of abuse and torture by local security forces, poor prison conditions, \narbitrary arrest and detention, and judicial corruption. Widespread disregard for the rule \nof law poses a serious problem. (Item 5) \n \nRussia  \n \nRussia has a highly centralized, authoritarian political system led by President \nVladimir Putin. Although \u201c[t]he United States has long sought a full and constructive \n\n \n \n \n \n3 \nrelationship with Russia,\u201d current relations between the two old war allies appear to \nhave again turned adversarial. Of note, in August 2017, the President signed into U.S. \nlaw sanctions targeting Russia for, in part, Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. \nelections and Russia\u2019s aggression in Ukraine, including its continuing unlawful \nannexation of Crimea. In 2015, the (former) Director of National Intelligence reported to \nCongress that the leading state intelligence threats to the United States will continue to \ncome from two main countries, one of which is Russia.  \n \nA recent human rights report from the U.S. State Department reflects the \ncommission of significant human rights violations in Russia, including restrictions on \npolitical participation and freedom of expression. It also noted the lack of due process in \npolitically motivated cases (Item 6) \n \n     Findings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant is 61-year-old senior linguist. He first worked for his present employer \nin about 2014. After a brief period of unemployment to due to downsizing, he was again \nemployed as a linguist in approximately July 2016. His commander noted that his \nservices within a specialized area have been \u201cindispensible,\u201d and he lauded Applicant\u2019s \nskills. (Supplemental Response to FORM) Applicant is a dedicated and self-sufficient \nworker. He has received a letter of appreciation from a member of the highest ranks for \nhis commendable enthusiasm, unwavering willingness to perform his duties with such \nhigh caliber, and \u201cselfless generosity and commitment.\u201d (SOR Response, attachment) \nSeveral other letters of appreciation, recommendations, and certificates of appreciation \nwere also submitted by Applicant, reflecting his excellent work performance.  \n \nApplicant was born and raised in Afghanistan. There, Applicant earned both a \nbachelor\u2019s and a master\u2019s degree in engineering before starting a career in general \nconstruction. In 1993, due to the upheaval and danger in Afghanistan, Applicant moved \nhis family to Russia as refugees. There, he leased an electronics store and \u201cworked \nvery hard\u201d to raise the funds to emigrate to the United States in 2004. He left Russia \nwhen he was in his late 40s, first returning the business to its landlord. (SOR Response \nat 2) Applicant and his family, including his wife and six adult children, became \nnaturalized U.S. citizens in early 2010. Applicant honors his oath as a U.S. citizen and is \ncommitted to defending this country.  \n \n \nIn Afghanistan, Applicant left a brother who was a citizen and resident of that \ncountry. The brother passed away in November 2016. (FORM Response) The two had \nnot communicated for a few years before the brother died.  \n \nApplicant has one daughter who came to the United States after he did. She  \nremains a citizen of Afghanistan, is currently a registered alien living in the United \nStates, and has applied for U.S. citizenship. In 2014, she began to suspect that her \nhusband, a citizen of Afghanistan, was using her and their marriage to obtain U.S. \nresidency. (SOR Answer at 2) This son-in-law, a citizen of Afghanistan, was last known \n\n \n \n \n \n4 \nto be a U.S. resident.2 The couple divorced in late 2015. Neither Applicant nor his family \nmembers maintain contact with this former in-law. Applicant\u2019s daughter, like four of her \nother siblings, lives near or with Applicant and his wife in the United States. \n \nApplicant\u2019s sixth child, another daughter, has remained a citizen and resident of \nRussia. She and her husband, who is also a citizen and resident of Russia, have three \nyoung children. In March 2012, Applicant\u2019s wife filed a sponsoring petition on behalf of \nthis daughter, son-in-law, and children to immigrate to the United States. (FORM \nResponse) That petition is still being processed. Applicant maintains bi-weekly contact \nwith his daughter through an Internet program. \n \nApplicant\u2019s Russian kin do not know of Applicant\u2019s work and \u201chave no idea that \n[he] worked [in a capacity aiding the United States].\u201d (FORM Response) Only \nApplicant\u2019s wife knows of Applicant\u2019s work and his place of employment. No family \nmember is in fear due to his work. (FORM Response) Applicant emphatically conveyed \nthat his \u201cfamily members do not represent a cause of divided loyalty\u201d for him, nor can \nthey be used to coerce him into assisting a foreign power. (FORM Response) None of \nhis family members are affiliated with any foreign military or organizations. Applicant \nsends no money to his family members abroad because he has \u201chis own family \nmembers . . . in the U.S. and [he is] working hard to support them, and they are [his] \nfirst and last priorities. . . . \u201c (FORM Response) In 2017, Applicant bought a new home \nin a new state, where his wife and all but his Russian-based child now reside. \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Recognizing the complexities of \nhuman behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the \nadjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, \nimpartial, and commonsense decision. The entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of \na number of variables known as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge \nmust consider all available, reliable information about the person in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. Under the \nAG, any doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to classified \ninformation will be resolved in favor of the national interest. In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record.  \n                                                          \n2 The SOR allegation at 1.c alleges that Applicant has a son-in-law who is a citizen and resident of \nAfghanistan and is employed by the Afghan Foreign Ministry. This son-in-law now lives somewhere in the \nUnited States. His present employer is unknown. \n\n \n \n \n \n5 \nThe Government must present evidence to establish controverted facts alleged in \nthe SOR. Under the Directive, an applicant is responsible for presenting witnesses and \nother evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by applicant or \nproven by Department Counsel and has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a \nfavorable security decision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours. The Government reposes a high degree of \ntrust and confidence in those granted access to classified information. Decisions \ninclude, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the applicant may deliberately or \ninadvertently fail to safeguard such information. Decisions shall be in terms of the \nnational interest and do not question the loyalty of an applicant.  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline B, Foreign Influence \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Foreign Influence is set out in AG \u00b6 6: \n \nForeign contacts and interests, including, but not limited to, business, \nfinancial, and property interests, are a national security concern if they \nresult in divided allegiance. They may also be a national security concern \nif they create circumstances in which the individual may be manipulated or \ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a \nway inconsistent with U.S. interests or otherwise made vulnerable to \npressure or coercion by any foreign interest. Assessment of foreign \ncontacts and interests should consider the country in which the foreign \ncontact or interest is located, including, but not limited to, considerations \nsuch as whether it is known to target U.S. citizen to obtain classified or \nsensitive information or is associated with a risk of terrorism.  \n \nApplicant has natural ties of affection with multiple family members who are \ncitizens of either Afghanistan or Russia, and residents of either Afghanistan, Russia, or \nthe United States. These include or have included Applicant\u2019s brother, two daughters, \nand two sons-in-law. It may be assumed he maintains normal familial attachments with \nhis sibling, daughters, and in-laws. Such contacts could compromise Applicant or his \nkin. I find disqualifying conditions AG \u00b6\u00b6 7(a)-(b) potentially apply:  \n \nAG \u00b6 7(a) contact, regardless of method, with a foreign family member, \nbusiness or professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen \nof or resident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk \nof foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion, \nand \n \n\n \n \n \n \n6 \nAG \u00b6 7(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country \nthat create a potential conflict of interest between the individual\u2019s \nobligation to protect classified or sensitive information or technology and \nthe individual\u2019s desire to help a foreign person, group, or country by \nproviding that information. \n \nAG \u00b6 8 provides three conditions that could possibly mitigate security concerns:   \n \nAG \u00b6 8(a) the nature of the relationship with foreign persons, the country in \nwhich these persons are located, or the positions or activities of those \npersons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be \nplaced in a position of having to choose between the interests of a foreign \nindividual, group, organization, or government and the interests of the U.S.; \n \nAG \u00b6 8(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s \nsense of loyalty or obligation to the foreign person, or allegiance to the \ngroup, government, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such \ndeep and longstanding relationships and loyalties in the United States that \nthe individual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interests in favor of \nthe U.S. interests; and \n \nAG \u00b6 8(c) contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and \ninfrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign \ninfluence or exploitation. \n \nThe presence of terrorism in Afghanistan is well established. Russia\u2019s active \npursuit of U.S. protected information is similarly recognized. Consequently, these \ncountries represent zones of high risk in terms of the security of Applicant\u2019s kin and the \npossibility foreign interests could pursue protected information believed to be in the \npossession of Applicant.  \n \nApplicant has clearly set forth that he is a proud U.S. citizen who is committed to \ndefending this country. He arrived in the United States in 2004 and became a \nnaturalized U.S. citizen eight years ago. He lives in this country with his wife, and all but \none of his children also live with him in the United States. As a family unit, they trailed \nalong with Applicant when he moved and purchased a new home in a new state in \n2017. There, they are enjoying the benefits of living in the United States of America. \nApplicant is committed to his life in the United States and to providing a secure and \nfinancially stable home base for his domestic kin. Except for two of his daughters, all of \nApplicant\u2019s children are naturalized United States citizens. \n \nApplicant\u2019s recently divorced daughter who lives in the United States, but retains \nAfghan citizenship, resides with Applicant. She is in the process of becoming a U.S. \ncitizen. The family maintains no relationship with her ex-husband. As for Applicant\u2019s \nbrother in Afghanistan, he passed away in 2016 after a period devoid of communication \nwith Applicant. Applicant has no remaining relations in Afghanistan.  \n\n \n \n \n \n7 \nRemaining abroad is the daughter of Applicant who resides in Russia with her \nhusband and three children. While Applicant maintains communication with this \ndaughter every two weeks via the Internet, neither she, her husband, nor any of \nApplicant\u2019s family except Applicant\u2019s wife know of his career or where he works. No \nmoney is sent to the couple in Russia, as Applicant focuses on providing for his \nimmediate family residing with or near him in the United States. Applicant\u2019s wife has \ninitiated sponsorship for the Russian kin to immigrate to the United States. Their status \ntoward that goal is presently pending. None of Applicant\u2019s relations have a nexus with a \nforeign government or organization. I find AG \u00b6\u00b6 8(a)-(b) apply. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, one must evaluate security clearance eligibility \nby considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant circumstances. \nConsideration shall be given to the nine adjudicative process factors listed in the AG. \nThe final determination must be an overall commonsense judgment based on careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.     \n    \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case, and conducted a whole-person \nanalysis based on the written record. In addition to Applicant\u2019s foreign relations, I \nconsidered factors such as his age, profession, education, and employment history.  \n \nThe facts offered with regard to Applicant\u2019s family members with a nexus to \nAfghanistan and Russia were substantially updated in 2018. Applicant\u2019s brother in \nAfghanistan has been deceased for a couple of years after a period of non-\ncommunication. The first of Applicant\u2019s daughters at issue is now a legal resident of the \nUnited States with an application pending for U.S. citizenship; she has divorced her \nAfghan husband and her family no longer has contact with him. \n \nRemaining at issue is Applicant\u2019s daughter and son-in-law in Russia, the country \nin which Applicant and his family resided for several years as refugees from \nAfghanistan. While Applicant maintains contact with this daughter via the Internet \nregularly, she does not know what he does for a living or where he works. Neither she \nnor her husband has a nexus to a foreign government or military. Applicant\u2019s spouse \nhas submitted sponsorship applications to permit this daughter and her family to \nimmigrate to the United States.  \n \nWhile the Russian kin pose some degree of concern, both Applicant\u2019s expressed \nfeelings and track record reflect that he considers the United States to be his family\u2019s \nseat. There is a demonstrated intent to reassemble his large family in his new state of \nresident. He owns a home large enough to accommodate his family. He is devoted to \nhis work. He uses his income for the betterment of his family in the United States only, \nconsidering those individuals to be of his utmost concern. At the same time, Applicant is \nexceptionally lauded for his translating work in a specific field. His recommendations \nand letters of appreciation are impressive. He is clearly an experienced and valuable \n\n \n \n \n \n8 \naddition to his employer\u2019s mission. Considering all these factors, I conclude Applicant\u2019s \nloyalty to the United States outweighs his loyalties for the Russian family now \nattempting to immigrate to the United States.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline B:  \n \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.e: \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \n \n     Conclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant a security clearance. \nEligibility for access to classified information is granted. \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nArthur E.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant is a 54-year-old employee who is seeking to retain a security clearance. He is employed as a fabricator for a company in the defense industry. He has been so employed since 2002. He serves as the lead of a fabrication shop located on a U.S. military installation. His educational background includes a high school diploma and about two years of college. He has married and divorced twice, with the last divorce in 2005. He has two adult children from his marriages. His employment history include military service in the U.S. Army from 1981 to 1995. (Tr. 42-47) His service included a year-long deployment for Operations Desert Shield and Storm, as known as the Persian Gulf War or the First Gulf War. The SOR concerns a history of financial problems consisting of failure to timely file state and federal income tax returns for tax years 2002 through 2013. Applicant does not dispute or contest the allegations. He disclosed that he failed to file state and federal income tax returns for tax year 2005, as a result of his second divorce, in his March 2014 security clearance application. (Exhibit 1) He attributed his tax problems to falling behind on his tax obligations, embarrassment, and inaction. (Tr. 30, 47-48) He described his situation as follows: What happened at the time was I\u2019d gotten behind in my taxes and owed almost $2,000, which I could not afford and simply got behind in my taxes and then felt embarrassed to bring it current.

Although he is now in compliance with federal and \nstate tax authorities, his tax problems went on for far too many years to justify complete \nmitigation. Accordingly, this case is decided against Applicant.    \n \nStatement of the Case \nApplicant completed and submitted a Standard Form (SF) 86, Questionnaire for \nNational Security Positions, the official form used for personnel security investigations, \non March 17, 2014. (Exhibit 1) This document is commonly known as a security \nclearance application. Thereafter, on December 12, 2014, after reviewing the \napplication and the information gathered during a background investigation, the \nDepartment of Defense Consolidated Adjudications Facility, Fort Meade, Maryland, sent \nApplicant a statement of reasons (SOR), explaining it was unable to find that it was \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant him eligibility for access to classified \ninformation. The SOR is similar to a complaint. It detailed the factual reasons for the \naction under the security guideline known as Guideline F for financial considerations.   \n\n \n2 \n \nApplicant answered the SOR on January 16, 2015. He admitted all the \nallegations concerning failure to timely file state and federal income tax returns for a \nnumber of tax years. He also requested a decision based on the written record in lieu of \na hearing before an administrative judge. The case was initially processed as a non-\nhearing case in about April 2015, but for reasons that are unclear the case was \nmisplaced or not assigned to an administrative judge or both. (Tr. 15-17) The case \nresurfaced in 2018, Department Counsel contacted Applicant, and he indicated that he \nhad changed his mind and wanted a hearing, which he confirmed in writing on July 9, \n2018.   \n \nThe case was assigned to me on July 12, 2018. The hearing took place as \nscheduled on September 20, 2018. Applicant appeared without counsel. Department \nCounsel offered a single documentary exhibit, which was admitted as Exhibit 1. \nApplicant offered documentary exhibits, which were admitted as Exhibits A-X. Other \nthan Applicant, no witnesses were called. The hearing transcript (Tr.) was received on \nSeptember 27, 2018. \n \nThe record was kept open until October 5, 2018, and then extended by ten days, \nto provide Applicant an opportunity to present additional documentation concerning his \ntax problems. Those matters were timely received on October 11, 2018, and it is \nadmitted without objections as Exhibit Y.     \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant is a 54-year-old employee who is seeking to retain a security \nclearance. He is employed as a fabricator for a company in the defense industry. He \nhas been so employed since 2002. He serves as the lead of a fabrication shop located \non a U.S. military installation. His educational background includes a high school \ndiploma and about two years of college. He has married and divorced twice, with the \nlast divorce in 2005. He has two adult children from his marriages. His employment \nhistory include military service in the U.S. Army from 1981 to 1995. (Tr. 42-47) His \nservice included a year-long deployment for Operations Desert Shield and Storm, as \nknown as the Persian Gulf War or the First Gulf War.   \n \nThe SOR concerns a history of financial problems consisting of failure to timely \nfile state and federal income tax returns for tax years 2002 through 2013. Applicant \ndoes not dispute or contest the allegations. He disclosed that he failed to file state and \nfederal income tax returns for tax year 2005, as a result of his second divorce, in his \nMarch 2014 security clearance application. (Exhibit 1) He attributed his tax problems to \nfalling behind on his tax obligations, embarrassment, and inaction. (Tr. 30, 47-48) He \ndescribed his situation as follows: \n \nWhat happened at the time was I\u2019d gotten behind in my taxes and owed \nalmost $2,000, which I could not afford and simply got behind in my taxes \nand then felt embarrassed to bring it current. And each year, not having a \nprevious tax return, I just hoped it would not surface or anything. (Tr. 30) \n\n \n3 \n \nHe decided to take action to address his problematic tax situation after completing his \nMarch 2014 security clearance application. (Tr. 31-32)  \n \nApplicant is now in compliance with both federal and state tax authorities. Due to \nage, he was unable to file returns before tax year 2009, but he provided documentary \nproof of filing state and federal tax returns for tax years 2009 through 2017. (Exhibits A-\nY). He explained that he filed the returns periodically due to the cost involved using a \ntax preparer and availability of funds. (Tr. 34-35; Exhibit A) Going forward, his plan is to \nstay current with his tax obligations and never get into a similar situation. (Tr. 36) \n \nConcerning the federal income tax returns, Applicant filed returns as follows: (1) \n2009 past due in April 2014; (2) 2010 past due in April 2014; (3) 2011 past due in \nJanuary 2015; (4) 2012 past due in March 2015; (5) 2013 past due in April 2016; (6) \n2014 timely in March 2015; (7) 2015 timely in April 2016; (8) 2016 past due in July \n2018; and (9) 2017 filed past due in July 2018. (Exhibits G-O) IRS account transcripts \nfor tax years 2015, 2016, and 2017 show account balances of $0 for those three years. \n(Exhibits C-F)   \n \nConcerning the state income tax returns, Applicant filed returns as follows: (1) \n2009 past due in April 2014; (2) 2011 past due in January 2015; (3) 2012 past due in \nMarch 2015; (4) 2013 past due in April 2016; (5) 2014 timely in March 2015; (6) 2015 \ntimely in April 2016; (7) 2016 past due in July 2018; and (8) 2017 past due in July 2018. \n(Exhibits P-X) He received a $512 refund from the state tax authority for tax year 2017. \n(Exhibit B; Tr. 21) The state tax authority issued Applicant a certificate of \ncompliance/letter of good standing on September 26, 2018. (Exhibit Y)  \n \nLaw and Policies \n \n \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (E.O.) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of \nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review \nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the National Security \nAdjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information or \nEligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position (AG), effective June 8, 2017. \n \nIt is well-established law that no one has a right to a security clearance.1 As \nnoted by the Supreme Court in Department of the Navy v. Egan, \u201cthe clearly consistent \nstandard indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the \nside of denials.\u201d2 Under Egan, Executive Order 10865, and the Directive, any doubt \nabout whether an applicant should be allowed access to classified information will be \nresolved in favor of protecting national security. In Egan, the Supreme Court stated that \n                                                          \n1 Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988) (\u201cit should be obvious that no one has a \n\u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance\u201d); Duane v. Department of Defense, 275 F.3d 988, 994 (10th Cir. 2002) (no \nright to a security clearance).  \n \n2 484 U.S. at 531. \n \n\n \n4 \n \nthe burden of proof is less than a preponderance of evidence.3 The Appeal Board has \nfollowed the Court\u2019s reasoning, and a judge\u2019s findings of fact are reviewed under the \nsubstantial-evidence standard.4 \n \n \nThere is no presumption in favor of granting, renewing, or continuing eligibility for \naccess to classified information.5 Under the Directive, the parties have the following \nburdens: (1) Department Counsel has the burden of presenting evidence to establish \nfacts alleged in the SOR that have been controverted; (2) an applicant is responsible for \npresenting evidence to refute, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts that have been \nadmitted or proven; and (3) an applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain \na favorable clearance decision.6 \n \nDiscussion \n \n \nUnder Guideline F for financial considerations, the suitability of an applicant may \nbe questioned or put into doubt when that applicant has a history of excessive \nindebtedness or financial problems or difficulties. The overall concern is set forth in AG \n\u00b6 18 as follows: \n \nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. . . . \n \n \nThe concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified or sensitive information to obtain money or something else of \nvalue. It encompasses concerns about a person\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other \nimportant qualities. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified or sensitive \ninformation. \n \n \nIn analyzing the facts of this case, I considered the following disqualifying and \nmitigating conditions as most pertinent:  \n \nAG \u00b6 19(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations;  \n \nAG \u00b6 19(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual federal, state, or local \nincome tax returns or failure to pay annual federal, state, or local income \ntax as required; and  \n                                                          \n3 484 U.S. at 531. \n \n4 ISCR Case No. 01-20700 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002) (citations omitted).  \n \n5 ISCR Case No. 02-18663 (App. Bd. Mar. 23, 2004). \n \n6 Directive, Enclosure 3, \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.14 and E3.1.15. \n \n\n \n5 \n \nAG \u00b6 20(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax \nauthority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements.  \n \n \nThe evidence supports a conclusion that Applicant has a history of financial \nproblems that is sufficient to raise a security concern under Guideline F. The \ndisqualifying conditions noted above apply to this case.  \n \n \nApplicant made good progress in resolving the tax matters, and he is now in \ncompliance with both federal and state tax authorities. That means he has filed all tax \nreturns, as required, and he has paid all taxes due, as required. And he did a good job \ndocumenting his compliance.  \n \n \nIn addressing this issue, I note that an applicant\u2019s failure to timely file tax returns \nand pay tax when due bears close examination and is a matter of serious concern to the \nfederal government. The DOHA Appeal Board has made it clear that an applicant who \nfails repeatedly to fulfill their legal obligations, such as filing tax returns and paying tax \nwhen due, does not demonstrate the high degree of good judgment and reliability \nrequired of those granted access to classified information. See ISCR Case No. 15-\n06707 at 3 (App. Bd. Aug. 15, 2017).  \n \n \nHere, I am concerned about the duration of Applicant\u2019s tax problems and the \ntiming of his remedial action. Applicant failed to timely file state and federal income tax \nreturns for more than a decade. He has been in compliance for a relatively brief period \nof time compared with the time of his noncompliance. It is also noted that both his state \nand federal returns for the last two tax years, 2017 and 2018, were filed past the due \ndate. Considering the totality of facts and circumstances, it is far too soon to tell if he will \ncontinue to meet his tax obligations on a timely basis. Accordingly, the mitigating \ncondition at AG \u00b6 20(g) applies, but the evidence is not sufficient to justify complete \nmitigation of his long-standing irresponsibility in failing to meet his legal obligations.    \n \n \nFollowing Egan and the clearly consistent standard, I have doubts and concerns \nabout Applicant\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, good judgment, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. In reaching this conclusion, I weighed the evidence \nas a whole and considered if the favorable evidence outweighed the unfavorable \nevidence or vice versa. I also considered the whole-person concept. I conclude that he \nhas not met his ultimate burden of persuasion to show that it is clearly consistent with \nthe national interest to grant him eligibility for access to classified information.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nThe formal findings on the SOR allegations are: \n \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nAgainst Applicant  \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a -- 1.b:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n\n \n6 \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIt is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for \naccess to classified information. Eligibility denied.  \n \n \n \nMichael H. Leonard \nAdministrative Judge \n",

Hackett, Esq. \n______________ \nDecision \n______________ \nLOUGHRAN, Edward W., Administrative Judge: \nApplicant did not mitigate the personal conduct and alcohol consumption security \nconcerns. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.  \nStatement of the Case \nOn April 20, 2018, the Department of Defense (DOD) issued a Statement of \nReasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing security concerns under Guideline E, personal \nconduct. Applicant responded to the SOR on May 24, 2018, and requested a hearing \nbefore an administrative judge. On August 22, 2018, Department Counsel amended the \nSOR to add an additional allegation under Guideline E and allegations under Guideline \nG, alcohol consumption. Applicant responded to the amended SOR on September 20, \n2018. \nThe case was assigned to me on November 1, 2018. The Defense Office of \nHearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a notice of hearing on November 14, 2018, \nscheduling the hearing for January 23, 2019. The hearing was convened as scheduled. \nThe Government called two witnesses and submitted Government Exhibits (GE) 1 \nthrough 14, which were admitted in evidence without objection. Applicant testified, \n02/07/2019\n\n \n2 \n \ncalled two witnesses, and submitted Applicant\u2019s Exhibits (AE) A through D, which were \nadmitted without objection. The record was held open for Applicant to submit additional \ninformation. He submitted AE E, which was admitted without objection. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant is a 58-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has worked for \nhis current employer since 2014. He served in the U.S. military from 1983 until he \nretired with an honorable discharge in 2003. He seeks to retain a security clearance, \nwhich he has held since he was in the military. He has a bachelor\u2019s degree, awarded in \n2009, and a master\u2019s degree, awarded in 2011. He is married with three adult children \nand three adult stepchildren.1 \n \n \nApplicant has a history of driving and alcohol-related incidents, and problems in \nthe workplace. The alcohol and driving incidents will be addressed first. He was \narrested twice in about 1978 to 1979 for driving under the influence (DUI). He was about \n18 or 19 years old at the time. When he was interviewed for a background investigation \nin 1987, he stated that he was fined more than $100 for one of the DUIs, but he did not \nrecall the amount of the other fine. At his hearing, he initially testified that he could not \nremember being arrested for DUI during that time period. He eventually conceded that \nhe had been arrested as alleged, but he later again stated that he could not recall \nwhether the incidents occurred. Applicant\u2019s testimony and statements about this and \nother incidents were evasive, inconsistent, and not credible.2 \n \n \nApplicant was arrested in May 1988 and charged with drunk driving and \nspeeding by going 49 miles per hour (MPH) in a 35 MPH zone. He pleaded guilty to \nreckless driving, and the speeding offense was dismissed. He paid a $200 fine, and his \nlicense was suspended for 30 days.3 \n \n \nApplicant wrote in his response to the SOR that he \u201cstopped at a local bar that \nserved alcohol, and [he] recall[ed] drinking one beer.\u201d He stated that the drunk driving \ncharge was reduced and \u201cwould have been dismissed if it weren\u2019t for the speed.\u201d He \nadmitted at his hearing that he may have had two or more beers. The military police \nreport of the incident indicates that Applicant failed the field sobriety test and his blood \nalcohol content (BAC) was measured at 12% and 13%. He testified that the BAC may \nhave been affected by his dentures.4 \n \n                                                          \n1 Tr. at 73-74, 85-88; GE 1; AE D. \n \n2 Tr. at 103-107, 118-119; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 14.

It may be considered in assessing Applicant\u2019s \ncredibility, in the application of mitigating conditions, and in the whole-person analysis. \n \n3 Tr. at 110; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 12. \n \n4 Tr. at 111-113; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 12. \n \n\n \n3 \n \n \nApplicant was charged with public swearing/intoxication in July 2007. He paid a \n$71 fine, and the charge was subsequently dismissed. Applicant stated that the police \nwere called after an argument with his wife.5 \n \n \nApplicant was arrested in June 2013 and charged with driving while intoxicated \n(DWI), first offense. He pleaded guilty to the reduced charge of reckless driving. He was \nsentenced to 60 days in jail, with all time suspended; probation for 12 months; a \nrestricted driver\u2019s license; and a $500 fine.6 \n \n \nApplicant stated that he had no more than three beers at a baseball game, and \nhe did not think his driving would be impaired. He admitted that his BAC was .09% to \n.10%. When he was interviewed for his background investigation in March 2014, he \nstated that the 2013 arrest was an isolated incident and not part of a pattern of alcohol-\nrelated issues. He denied ever being charged with any other alcohol-related offenses.7 \nHe wrote in his response to the SOR: \n \nDuring my court appearance the prosecution agreed to reduce the charge \nto reckless driving because this was my first and only offense in my entire \ndriving history at the time which was considered as mitigating evidence. \nTherefore, I was officially charged with a lesser charge of reckless driving. \nI plead[ed] guilty and paid the applicable fine. I emphasize that this was \nmy first offense, at that time, in my entire driving history. \n \n \nApplicant testified that he did not intend to be dishonest, and that he said he had \nonly one alcohol-related driving offense because he thought the investigation was \nlimited to the previous seven years. He also stated that he thought that because the \ncharges had been reduced to reckless driving, they did not count.8  \n  \n \nApplicant was charged in 2014 with the misdemeanor offense of reckless driving: \nimproper brakes. He was found guilty of the lesser offense of improper control/driving. \nApplicant stated that he was reaching for a pair of sunglasses when a car cut in front of \nhim and abruptly stopped. He hit the back of the car. Alcohol was not involved.9 \n \n \nApplicant attended and completed alcohol counseling as a requirement of his \nprobation for the 2013 offense. He stated that he has learned from the experience, he \ndoes not drink to excess, there have been no additional driving offenses, and there will \nbe no additional alcohol-related incidents.10   \n                                                          \n5 Tr. at 110-111; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 2, 13. \n \n6 Tr. at 111; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 1, 2, 4. \n \n7 Tr. at 111; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 2. \n \n8 Tr. at 107-109. \n \n9 Applicant\u2019s response to SOR. \n \n10 Tr. at 114-117, 119-120; GE 2. \n\n \n4 \n \n \nApplicant was terminated from a job in 2007 after his employer discovered \nmultiple pornographic files on his network drive. Applicant stated that he was leaving the \ncompany, and he brought in a compact disc (CD) from home to copy some personal \nfiles from his work computer. He mistakenly picked up a CD that had pornography on it. \nHe stated that he did not intentionally place the files on the network drive, and that they \nwere accidentally uploaded to the drive while he was copying other files. He stated that \nhe was terminated the next day, \u201con the same day that [he] had planned to resign.\u201d11 \n \n \nApplicant provided a similar, but slightly different, account of the termination \nduring a January 2009 background interview. He stated that he accidently copied the \npornographic material onto his work computer from a memory stick. He was fired about \ntwo weeks later, and he did not mention that he had already planned to resign.12 \n \n \nApplicant worked for a defense contractor from about March 2013 until his \ncontact was terminated as the result of a layoff in October 2013. In April 2013, he \nviolated policy when he downloaded a file from his personal e-mail account, which \ncontained multiple usernames and passwords for DOD accounts and other personal \naccount information. He received a written reprimand in which he was directed to take \nadditional training, with a warning that if his \u201cfuture activities result in additional security \nincidents, disciplinary action, such as a formal performance action plan or involuntary \nseparation, may follow.\u201d Applicant admitted that he had an Excel spreadsheet with \n\u201cnonworking\u201d old passwords that he used to keep track of old passwords, so that he \nwould not use them again.13 \n  \n \nIn about September 2013, Applicant plugged his personal phone into his work \ncomputer to charge the phone. He immediately removed it when he was told that he \nhad violated security rules.14 \n \n \nApplicant was at a work meeting in about October 2013 when he commented to \nthe person next to him to the effect that if he brought his firearm, he could take out the \nentire leadership or a bomb could do the same. Applicant denied making a threat. He \nmeant the comment to be a precaution about the lack of security in the facility.15 \n \n \nApplicant is highly regarded, as reported by two witnesses and various \ndocuments. He is praised for his excellent job performance, work ethic, trustworthiness, \nprofessionalism, and integrity.16 \n                                                          \n11 Tr. at 88-91; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 1, 3, 11, 14. \n \n12 GE 14. \n \n13 Tr. at 20-21, 28-29, 74, 77-79, 91-93; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 1, 2, 5, 10; AE E.  \n \n14 Tr. at 93-94; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 2.  \n \n15 Tr. at 43-45, 79-82, 96-99; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR. \n \n16 Tr. at 59-71; AE B, C. \n \n\n \n5 \n \nPolicies \n \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG), which became \neffective on June 8, 2017. \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.  \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \n\n \n6 \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline G, Alcohol Consumption \n \nThe security concern for alcohol consumption is set out in AG \u00b6 21:   \n \nExcessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable \njudgment or the failure to control impulses, and can raise questions about \nan individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness. \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 22. The following is potentially applicable in this case:   \n \n(a) alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while under \nthe influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or \nother incidents of concern, regardless of the frequency of the individual's \nalcohol use or whether the individual has been diagnosed with alcohol use \ndisorder.  \n \nApplicant was arrested on four occasions for DUI, drunk driving, or DWI. He was \ncharged with public swearing/intoxication in 2007. AG \u00b6 22(a) is applicable.  \n \nConditions that could mitigate alcohol consumption security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 23. The following are potentially applicable:  \n \n(a) so much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, \nor judgment; \n \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her pattern of maladaptive alcohol \nuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and \nhas demonstrated a clear and established pattern of modified \nconsumption \nor \nabstinence \nin \naccordance \nwith \ntreatment \nrecommendations; and \n \n(d) the individual has successfully completed a treatment program along \nwith any required aftercare, and has demonstrated a clear and established \npattern of modified consumption or abstinence in accordance with \ntreatment recommendations. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s most recent alcohol-related offense was in 2013. He attended and \ncompleted alcohol counseling as a requirement of his probation. He stated that he has \nlearned from the experience, he does not currently drink to excess, and there will be no \nadditional alcohol-related incidents. However, Applicant\u2019s testimony about his arrests \nwas inconsistent, contradictory, and not worthy of belief. Without candor, I am unable to \nconclude that the conduct is unlikely to recur.   \n\n \n7 \n \n \nI find that Applicant\u2019s conduct continues to cast doubt on his current reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and good judgment. AG \u00b6 23(a) is not applicable. AG \u00b6\u00b6 23(b) and \n23(d) have some applicability, but they are insufficient to overcome concerns about his \nalcohol-related criminal conduct.  \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct  \n \n  \nThe security concern for personal conduct is set out in AG \u00b6 15, as follows: \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process. \n \n  \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. The following disqualifying conditions are potentially applicable: \n \n(c) credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is \nnot sufficient for an adverse determination under any other single \nguideline, but which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-\nperson \nassessment \nof \nquestionable \njudgment, \nuntrustworthiness, \nunreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and \nregulations, or other characteristics indicating that the individual may not \nproperly safeguard classified or sensitive information;  \n \n(d) credible adverse information that is not explicitly covered under any \nother guideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an adverse \ndetermination, but which, when combined with all available information, \nsupports a whole-person assessment of questionable judgment, \nuntrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply \nwith rules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that the \nindividual may not properly safeguard classified or sensitive information. \nThis includes, but is not limited to, consideration of: \n \n(1) untrustworthy or unreliable behavior to include breach of client \nconfidentiality, release of proprietary information, unauthorized \nrelease of sensitive corporate or government protected information; \n \n(2) any disruptive, violent, or other inappropriate behavior; \n \n(3) a pattern of dishonesty or rule violations; and \n \n(4) evidence of significant misuse of Government or other \nemployer\u2019s time or resources; and \n \n\n \n8 \n \n(e) personal conduct, or concealment of information about one\u2019s conduct, \nthat creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress by a \nforeign intelligence entity or other individual or group. Such conduct \nincludes: \n \n(1) engaging in activities which, if known, could affect the person\u2019s \npersonal, professional, or community standing.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s alcohol-related criminal conduct is cross-alleged under Guideline E. \nThat conduct reflects questionable judgment and an unwillingness to comply with rules \nand regulations. It also created vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, and duress. \nAG \u00b6 16(e) is applicable. AG \u00b6 16(c) is not perfectly applicable because Applicant\u2019s \nconduct is sufficient for an adverse determination under the alcohol consumption and \ncriminal conduct guidelines. However, the general concerns about questionable \njudgment and an unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations contained in AG \u00b6\u00b6 \n15 and 16(c) are established for the alcohol-related conduct.  \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.b alleges the 2013 DWI. SOR \u00b6 1.g alleges all of the alcohol-related \nconduct, including the 2013 DWI. There is no conduct in SOR \u00b6 1.b that is not also \nalleged in SOR \u00b6 1.g. When the same conduct is alleged twice in the SOR under the \nsame guideline, one of the duplicative allegations should be resolved in Applicant\u2019s \nfavor. See ISCR Case No. 03-04704 at 3 (App. Bd. Sep. 21, 2005). SOR \u00b6 1.b is \nconcluded for Applicant.  \n \nApplicant violated policy and security rules and procedures in 2007 by having \npornographic files on his network drive; in 2013, when he downloaded a file from his \npersonal e-mail account, which contained multiple usernames and passwords for DOD \naccounts and other personal account information; and again in 2013, when he plugged \nhis personal phone into his work computer. He was charged in 2014 with the \nmisdemeanor offense of reckless driving: improper brakes. He was found guilty of the \nlesser offense of improper control/driving. AG \u00b6 16(e) is applicable. AG \u00b6\u00b6 16(c) and \n16(d) are not perfectly applicable because the conduct is sufficient for an adverse \ndetermination under other guidelines. However, the general concerns about \nquestionable judgment and an unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations \ncontained in AG \u00b6\u00b6 15, 16(c), and 16(d) are established.  \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.e alleges that Applicant was removed from his position in October 2013 \nprior to his scheduled end date on the contract after he made threatening comments \ntoward the leadership. That allegation is not established by substantial evidence. SOR \u00b6 \n1.e is concluded for Applicant. \nAG \u00b6 17 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. The following \nare potentially applicable:  \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \n\n \n9 \n \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, \nunreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely \nto recur; and \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate \nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress. \n \nAny one or more of the allegations could be mitigated if they were considered on \ntheir own in a piecemeal basis. However, the number of allegations, combined with \nApplicant\u2019s lack of candor, preclude mitigation. Concerns about his reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and good judgment remain. Personal conduct security concerns are not \nmitigated. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the \npotentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and \ncircumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuidelines E and G in my whole-person analysis. I also considered Applicant\u2019s \nhonorable military service and his excellent character evidence. However, he has \nmultiple alcohol-related driving offenses and work problems, and he cannot be trusted \nto tell the truth. \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude Applicant did not \nmitigate the personal conduct and alcohol consumption security concerns.  \n\n \n10 \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline E:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.b:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.c-1.d: \n \n \nAgainst Applicant  \nSubparagraph 1.e:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.f-1.g: \n \n \nAgainst Applicant  \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline G:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nSubparagraphs 2.a-2.d: \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIt is not clearly consistent with the national interest to continue Applicant\u2019s \neligibility for a security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n \n________________________ \nEdward W. Loughran \nAdministrative Judge \n",

Applicant started working for federal contractors in 2000, and she has been consistently employed by federal contractors to present, except for two unemployment periods from October 2015 through June 2016 (nine months), and August 2016 through February 2017 (seven months). Applicant was granted a secret clearance in 2002, which was upgraded to a top-secret clearance in 2004.

Temple, Esq., Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro se  \n__________ \nDecision \n__________ \nRIVERA, Juan J., Administrative Judge: \nApplicant\u2019s periods of unemployment and underemployment contributed to or \naggravated her financial problems. Under her circumstances, she has been responsibly \naddressing her delinquent accounts. With her current earnings, she should be able to \npay for her family\u2019s living expenses and current debts. Her financial problems are being \nresolved. Clearance granted. \nStatement of the Case \nApplicant submitted a security clearance application (SCA) on September 18, \n2012, seeking to continue the clearance required for her position with a federal \ncontractor. After reviewing the information gathered during the background \ninvestigation, the Department of Defense (DOD) issued her a Statement of Reasons \n(SOR) on August 15, 2015, alleging security concerns under Guideline F (financial \nconsiderations). She requested a hearing before an administrative judge from the \nDefense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA).  \nThe Notice of Hearing (NOH) was issued on December 30, 2015, setting a \nhearing for January 25, 2016. That hearing was cancelled on January 14, 2016, after \nApplicant\u2019s employment was terminated and DOHA lost jurisdiction over her case. \n10/30/2018\n\n \n2 \n \n \nApplicant was rehired by a federal contractor on March 1, 2017. (Tr. 11) Her case was \nreopened as a \u201cpriority case,\u201d and DOHA assigned the case to me on June 7, 2018. A \nnew NOH was issued on June 20, 2018, setting the hearing for June 29, 2018. \nApplicant affirmatively waived her right to 15-days advanced notice of her hearing both \non June 11, 2018, and at her hearing. (See Hearing Exhibit 1; Tr. 11-13) \n \nAt the hearing, the Government offered two exhibits (GE 1 and 2). Applicant \ntestified and submitted two exhibits. (AE 1 and 2) All exhibits were admitted without \nobjection. DOHA received the hearing transcript (Tr.) on July 11, 2018. \n \nProcedural Issues \n \nDepartment Counsel moved to amend the August 2015 SOR on June 7, 2018. \nThe amendment requested the striking of SOR \u00b6 1.a, and substituting for it four new \nfinancial specifications: SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.d. Applicant did not object and the \namendment was granted as requested. (Tr. 14-15) The motion to amend the SOR, \ndated June 8, 2018, and Applicant\u2019s answers to the amended SOR, dated June 26, \n2018, were made part of the pleadings and are attached to the record. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nIn her Answer, Applicant did not specifically admit or deny any of the SOR \nallegations. However, through her comments, explanations, and the documentary \nevidence provided, she indirectly admitted all of the SOR allegations (\u00b6\u00b6 1.a through \n1.d). Applicant\u2019s admissions to the SOR and at her hearing are incorporated herein as \nfindings of fact. After a thorough review of the record evidence, including her testimony \nand demeanor while testifying, I make the following additional findings of fact:  \n \nApplicant is a 41-year-old employee of a federal contractor. She completed an \nassociate\u2019s degree in December 2006, and is currently working on her bachelor\u2019s \ndegree. She has never been married. She has three adult children, ages 26, 22, and 20.  \n \nApplicant started working for federal contractors in 2000, and she has been \nconsistently employed by federal contractors to present, except for two unemployment \nperiods from October 2015 through June 2016 (nine months), and August 2016 through \nFebruary 2017 (seven months). Applicant was granted a secret clearance in 2002, \nwhich was upgraded to a top-secret clearance in 2004. She has continuously held her \nclearance eligibility since 2002 to present, except for a period during which it was \nsuspended due to a lack of sponsor. There is no evidence showing any additional \nsecurity concerns, except for those in the current SOR.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s October 2015 employment termination apparently was due to \ndisciplinary or performance-related issues. (Tr. 34-37) Following her termination, \nApplicant was underemployed or unemployed. During her period of unemployment, \nApplicant took temporary jobs, including a job as a driver. She received unemployment \n\n \n3 \n \n \nbenefits, took loans, and used her credit to pay her living expenses and her children\u2019s \ncollege expenses.  \n \nApplicant explained that between October 2015 and July 2017, her income was \ninsufficient to pay her family\u2019s living expenses, assist her children with their college \nexpenses, and pay her debts. An investment property and her home were about to be \nforeclosed and she had numerous delinquent debts. Applicant sold the investment \nproperty and modified the home mortgage, taking it out of foreclosure and bringing the \nmortgage to current.  \n \nIn July 2017, Applicant\u2019s current employer, a federal contractor, hired her as a \nfinancial manager. Her income went from making $25 an hour, to a yearly salary of \n$115,000. Since July 2017, Applicant has been diligently addressing her delinquent \naccounts, many of which were not alleged in the SOR. Applicant was unable to start \npaying her delinquent accounts any sooner because she was the main breadwinner of \nthe family and her income was insufficient to pay all of their financial obligations at the \nsame time. Applicant had three children attending college. She elected to forego taking \nstudent loans for their children. Instead, she provided financial assistance to them to \nenable them to complete college without loans. \n \nIn her 2012 SCA, Applicant disclosed that she had financial problems that \nincluded a delinquent mortgage, delinquent student loans, personal loans in default, and \ndelinquent consumer credit accounts. The SOR alleged four delinquent or charged-off \naccounts. Based on Applicant\u2019s documentary evidence (submitted with the SOR \nresponse), the status of the alleged debts is as follows: \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.a (collection for $1,045). Applicant paid this account in May 2018. \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.b (charged-off debt for $4,080). Applicant paid $1,025 and decreased \nthe balance from $4,080 to $2,629 in April 2018. She anticipated paying off this debt by \nthe end of 2018. \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.c (charged-off car loan for $19,302). Applicant paid $1,331 in June \n2018. She established a monthly payment plan. The documentary evidence shows that \nshe decreased the balance from $19,302 to $10,647. \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.d (charged-off loan for $27,238). Applicant established a payment plan \nand has been paying $455 a month. She decreased the balance from $27,238 to \n$21,333. \n \nApplicant acknowledged that she should have been more diligent paying her \ndelinquent accounts. However, she believes she was doing the best she could do under \nher circumstances. She paid as much of her delinquent accounts as she could to \nbalance the payments of her other debts. She understands the seriousness of the \nsecurity concerns raised by her financial problems. She promised to timely pay her \ndebts in the future. Applicant highlighted her 18 years of employment with federal \n\n \n4 \n \n \ncontractors while holding a clearance during most of that period without any issues or \nconcerns, except for his financial problems. Applicant credibly promised to continue \npaying her debts and to resolve her financial problems. She believes that with her \ncurrent income, her financial situation is now stable, and she will be able to maintain her \nfinancial responsibility and eligibility for a clearance. Applicant has not received financial \ncounseling, but she is following a budget. (Tr. 50) \n \nPolicies \n \nThe SOR was issued under Executive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information Within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (Directive) \n(January 2, 1992), as amended; and the  Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining \nEligibility for Access to Classified Information or Eligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position \n(AG), implemented by the DOD on June 8, 2017.  \n \nEligibility for access to classified information may be granted \u201conly upon a finding \nthat it is clearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865, \u00a7 2. The \nU.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the Executive Branch \nin regulating access to information pertaining to national security, emphasizing that \u201cno \none has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. \n518, 528 (1988). \n \nThe AG list disqualifying and mitigating conditions for evaluating a person\u2019s \nsuitability for access to classified information. Any one disqualifying or mitigating \ncondition is not, by itself, conclusive. However, the AG should be followed where a case \ncan be measured against them, as they represent policy guidance governing access to \nclassified information. Each decision must reflect a fair, impartial, and commonsense \nconsideration of the whole person and the factors listed in SEAD 4, App. A \u00b6\u00b6 2(d) and \n2(f). All available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, must be considered.  \n \nSecurity clearance decisions resolve whether it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant or continue an applicant\u2019s security clearance. The Government \nmust prove, by substantial evidence, controverted facts alleged in the SOR. If it does, \nthe burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts. The \napplicant bears the heavy burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant or continue his or her security clearance.  \n \nPersons with access to classified information enter into a fiduciary relationship \nwith the Government based on trust and confidence. Thus, the Government has a \ncompelling interest in ensuring each applicant possesses the requisite judgment, \nreliability, and trustworthiness of those who must protect national interest as their own. \nThe \u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d standard compels resolution of any \nreasonable doubt about an applicant\u2019s suitability for access in favor of the Government. \n\u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d \n\n \n5 \n \n \nEgan, 484 U.S. at 531; SEAD 4, \u00b6 E(4); SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6\u00b6 1(d) and 2(b). Clearance \ndecisions are not a determination of the loyalty of the applicant concerned. They are \nmerely an indication that the applicant has or has not met the strict guidelines the \nGovernment has established for issuing a clearance. \n \nAnalysis \n \nFinancial Considerations \n \nAG \u00b6 18 articulates the security concern relating to financial problems:  \n \nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified information. Financial distress can also be caused or \nexacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other issues of \npersonnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental health \nconditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds . . .  \n \nApplicant\u2019s history of financial problems is documented in the record. She \ndeveloped financial problems around 2016, because she was terminated from her \nposition. Because of her periods of unemployment and underemployment, she acquired \nsubstantial debt. AG \u00b6 19 provides two disqualifying conditions that could raise a \nsecurity concern and may be disqualifying in this case: \u201c(a) inability to satisfy debts\u201d; \nand \u201c(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations.\u201d The record established the \ndisqualifying conditions, requiring additional inquiry about the possible applicability of \nmitigating conditions.  \n \nThe following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially applicable: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment;  \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or \nseparation, clear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity \ntheft), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n  \n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem from \na legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit counseling \n\n \n6 \n \n \nservice, and there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved \nor is under control; \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts;1 and \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue.  \n \nThe Appeal Board concisely explained Applicant\u2019s responsibility for proving the \napplicability of mitigating conditions as follows:  \n \nOnce a concern arises regarding an Applicant\u2019s security clearance \neligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance \nof a security clearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th \nCir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991). After the Government \npresents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the \napplicant to rebut or mitigate those concerns. See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. The \nstandard applicable in security clearance decisions is that articulated in \nEgan, supra. \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for \naccess to classified information will be resolved in favor of the national \nsecurity.\u201d Directive, Enclosure 2 \u00b6 2(b).  \n \nISCR Case No. 10-04641 at 4 (App. Bd. Sept. 24, 2013).  \n \n \nAll of the above financial considerations mitigating conditions are raised by the \nfacts in this case and mitigate the security concerns. Applicant\u2019s financial problems are \nongoing and recent because she is still paying her delinquent debts. However, her \nfinancial problems occurred under circumstances unlikely to recur and they do not cast \ndoubt on her current reliability, trustworthiness, or judgment.  \n \n                                            \n1 The Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a \u201cgood faith\u201d effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts:  \n \nIn order to qualify for application of [the \u201cgood faith\u201d mitigating condition], an applicant \nmust present evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \nsome other good-faith action aimed at resolving the applicant\u2019s debts. The Directive does \nnot define the term \u201cgood-faith.\u201d However, the Board has indicated that the concept of \ngood-faith \u201crequires a showing that a person acts in a way that shows reasonableness, \nprudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.\u201d Accordingly, an applicant must \ndo more than merely show that he or she relied on a legally available option (such as \nbankruptcy) in order to claim the benefit of [the \u201cgood faith\u201d mitigating condition]. \n \n(internal citation and footnote omitted) ISCR Case No. 02-30304 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2004) (quoting \nISCR Case No. 99-9020 at 5-6 (App. Bd. June 4, 2001)).   \n\n \n7 \n \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s financial problems could be attributed to, or were aggravated by, her \nperiods of unemployment or underemployment with the subsequent decrease in family \nearnings. It is not clear whether Applicant losing her job was due to her own \nmisconduct. Nevertheless, I find that Applicant\u2019s actions after losing her job \ndemonstrate financial responsibility. She took part-time jobs to supplement her \nunemployment income and used her savings and credit to pay for some of her \ndelinquent accounts. \n \n \nThe June 2018 credit report in evidence show 34 trade lines, with only the four \naccounts alleged in the SOR being delinquent. After obtaining full-time employment with \nher current employer in March 2017, Applicant started to address her delinquent \naccounts. She paid off one account and has reduced substantially her debt on the \nremaining three accounts. Applicant also identified as factors that prevented her from \npaying her debts more diligently including her mortgage payments, her financial support \nfor three children attending college, and the necessity to pay other debts and living \nexpenses.  \n \n \nApplicant is making a good-faith effort to resolve her debt. Her actions, although \nrecent, show diligence and responsibility in the handling of her financial obligations. \nApplicant has not received financial counseling, but she is following a budget. She is in \nthe process of addressing her financial obligations in a manner consistent with her \nfinancial resources.  \n \n \nI find that the evidence does not support a finding that she was negligent in the \npayment of her financial obligations. She simply was not able to pay all her debts at the \nsame time. She divided her financial resources between her financial obligations and \nher living expenses in order to provide for her children\u2019s education.  \n \nThe AGs do not require an Applicant to immediately resolve or pay each and \nevery debt alleged in the SOR, to be debt free, or to resolve first the debts alleged in the \nSOR. An applicant needs only to establish a plan to resolve financial problems and take \nsignificant actions to implement the plan. Applicant has implemented a plan to resolve \nher financial problems and she has made significant progress implementing her plan. \n \n \nConsidering the evidence as a whole, and including her recent actions, Applicant \ndemonstrated financial responsibility. She disclosed her financial problems in her 2012 \nSCA. Her financial situation is improving and there are clear indications that her \nfinancial problems are being resolved and are under control. She has been paying her \ndelinquent accounts and promised to continue to do so. Her earnings should be \nsufficient to pay for her family\u2019s living expenses and current debts. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case, and under the whole-person \nconcept. SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6\u00b6 2(a) and 2(d). I have incorporated my comments under \n\n \n8 \n \n \nGuideline F in my whole-person analysis. Some of these factors were addressed under \nthat guideline, but some warrant additional comment. \n \nApplicant is a 41-year-old employee of a federal contractor. She has worked for \nfederal contractors since 2000. She has held a clearance during most of her \nemployment without any issues or concerns, except for her financial problems. The \nrecord evidence is sufficient to establish that her financial problems are being resolved \nand are under control.  \n \nConsidering the evidence as a whole, Applicant demonstrated a recent track \nrecord of paying her financial obligations. She is fully aware of the security concerns \nraised by her failure to maintain financial responsibility. She promised to maintain her \nfinancial responsibility. The financial considerations security concerns are mitigated.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:          \n \n  \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:   \n \n \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n  \nSubparagraphs 1.a - 1.d:  \n \n \n \nFor Applicant  \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest of the United States to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance to Applicant. Clearance is granted. \n \n \n \n____________________________ \nJUAN J. RIVERA \nAdministrative Judge \n",

Cohen, Esq. \n__________ \nDecision \n__________ \nCurry, Marc, Administrative Judge: \nApplicant mitigated the security concerns generated by his contacts and financial \ninterests in the Philippines. The romantic relationship that he had with a Thai woman \nseveral years ago when he was working in Estonia generates no security concern. As \nfor security concerns under the personal conduct guideline, Applicant did not falsify his \n2012 security clearance application, and his acquaintances who are Filipino natives and \nresidents do not generate personal conduct security concerns. In sum, Applicant has \nmitigated all of the security concerns. Clearance is granted. \nStatement of the Case \nOn March 9, 2017, the Department of Defense (DOD) Consolidated \nAdjudications Facility (CAF) issued a statement of reasons (SOR) alleging security \nconcerns under Guideline B (foreign influence) and Guideline E (personal conduct). The \naction was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information \nwithin Industry (February 20, 1990), as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense \nIndustrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as \namended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG), which became effective on \nSeptember 1, 2006. \n01/25/2019\n\n \n2 \n                                                                                                                                              \nThe SOR further informed Applicant that, based on information available to the \nGovernment, DOD adjudicators could not make the affirmative finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the interests of national security to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s security \nclearance. It recommended that his case be submitted to an administrative judge for a \ndetermination whether his clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked. \n \nOn March 29, 2017, Applicant responded to the SOR, denying all of the \nallegations except 1.d and 1.e, and requested a hearing.1 The case was initially \nassigned to another administrative judge on June 13, 2018, before it was transferred to \nme on September 18, 2018. On September 21, 2018, the hearing was scheduled for \nOctober 5, 2018.  \n \nAt the hearing, Department Counsel submitted five documents for admission that \nI marked as Government Exhibits (GEs) 1 through 5. Counsel for Applicant objected to \nthe admission of GE 4 and GE 5. I sustained the objection, only admitting GEs 1 \nthrough 3 into the record. Upon reconsideration, I have decided to admit GE 4. \n \nCounsel for Applicant proposed 26 exhibits for admission. (Applicant Exhibit (AE) \nA \u2013 AE Z) I admitted all of these exhibits into the record except AE O, which I excluded \nafter considering Department Counsel\u2019s objection. \n \nAt the hearing, I also incorporated Department Counsel\u2019s list of Government \nExhibits (Hearing Exhibit (HE) I), and a copy of Department Counsel\u2019s discovery letter \n(HE II). In addition, Department Counsel submitted a memo (HE III) requesting that I \ntake administrative notice of the facts set forth in four U.S. Department of State \ndocuments regarding the Philippines (HE IV \u2013 HE VIII). Applicant\u2019s counsel objected. I \nstayed my decision on the administrative notice request, leaving the record open \nthrough October 26, 2018 to allow Applicant\u2019s counsel to respond to Department \nCounsel\u2019s request, and to submit administrative notice documents, if desired. Within the \ntime allotted, Applicant\u2019s counsel submitted a memo (HE IX) requesting that I take \nadministrative notice of the facts set forth in eight documents (HE X \u2013 XVIII). After \nconsidering all of the facts set forth in the exhibits provided by both parties, I have \ndecided to take administrative notice of all of them except HE XV, Human Rights Watch \n2016\u2014The United States, and HE XVI, Department of Justice Federal Bureau of \nInvestigation: 2016 Crime in the United States.  \n \nWhile my decision was pending, Security Executive Agent Directive 4 was issued \nestablishing National Security Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) applicable to all covered \nindividuals who require initial or continued eligibility for access to classified information \nor eligibility to hold a sensitive position. The AG supersede the adjudicative guidelines \n                                            \n1 There are six allegations under Paragraph 1 and five allegations under Paragraph 2. The Paragraph 1 \nallegations are correctly annotated as subparagraphs 1.a through 1.f. The Paragraph 2 allegations are \nerroneously annotated as 2.g through 2.k rather than 2.a through 2.e. After Department Counsel identified \nthis error at the hearing and discussed it with Applicant\u2019s counsel, the parties suggested that, as a matter \nof judicial economy, I forego amending the SOR,and rule upon the allegations, as written. I concurred. \n(Tr. 7-8) \n\n \n3 \n                                                                                                                                              \nimplemented in September 2006 and are effective for any adjudication made on or after \nJune 8, 2017. Accordingly, I have adjudicated Applicant\u2019s security clearance eligibility \nunder the new AG. The transcript was received on October 16, 2018. \n \nPreliminary Rulings \n \n \n1. Section 19 of the security clearance application that Applicant completed in \n2012 contains the following question: \n \nDo you have, or have you had, close and/or continuing contact with a \nforeign national within the last seven (7) years with whom you, or your \nspouse, or cohabitant are bound by affection, influence, common \ninterests, and/or obligation? . . .\u201d \n \nApplicant answered \u201cno,\u201d elaborating as follows: \n \nI have several women that I have met in my foreign travels, but none that I \nwould consider to be seriously bound by affection or obligatien [sic] with. \n \nSOR subparagraph 2.h alleges Applicant\u2019s \u201cno\u201d answer constitutes a falsification. \nCounsel for Applicant filed a motion to dismiss this claim, arguing that the allegation, on \nits face, does not state a justiciable claim.  \n \n \nWhether the nature of Applicant\u2019s relationships with these foreign women is as \ncasual as he believes them to be is certainly an issue to be addressed under the \nGuideline B security concerns, as alleged in Paragraph 1. Similarly, the nature and \nappropriateness of these relationships raise a Guideline E issue, as alleged in \nsubparagraph 2.g. However, Applicant\u2019s negative response to Section 19, in conjunction \nwith his disclosure that he has met several women over the years during his foreign \ntravels whom he is not bound by affection or obligation is sufficiently candid and \nforthcoming, so as not to raise any issue of falsification, on its face. Applicant\u2019s \ncounsel\u2019s motion to dismiss subparagraph 2.h is granted. (DoD Directive 5220.6, \nE3.1.10) \n \n \n2. Section 20B of the 2012 security clearance application required Applicant to \ndisclose if he had ever provided financial support for any foreign national. His negative \nanswer, together with his detailed elaboration,2 is candid and forthcoming. \nConsequently, subparagraph 2.i, on its face, raises no issue of falsification. Applicant\u2019s \ncounsel\u2019s motion to dismiss subparagraph 2.i is granted. (DoD Directive 5220.6, \nE3.1.10) \n \n                                            \n2There have been several foreign women I have given money to via Western Union in the \nPhilippines as gifts to help them, but I would not consider the gifts as long-term financial support. I \ndo not know their addresses to be able to answer the questions properly if I answered \u2018yes.\u2019 \n \n\n \n4 \n                                                                                                                                              \n \n3. Section 20A of the 2012 security clearance application required Applicant to \ndisclose whether he had any additional foreign financial interests. Applicant\u2019s negative \nresponse was not followed by any additional explanation. The issue of whether his \nresponse constitutes a falsification, as alleged in SOR subparagraph 2.j, must be \nevaluated through the record evidence developed at the hearing. Applicant\u2019s counsel\u2019s \nmotion to dismiss subparagraph 2.j is denied. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant is a 56-year-old single man who was married previously between 1987 \nand 1995. The marriage ended in divorce. He has a high school diploma and has \nearned some college credits. (Tr. 231) After graduating from high school, he enlisted in \nthe U.S. Air Force in 1982, serving through his retirement in 2003. (GE 2 at 13) Per a \nfellow Air Force veteran who served with him, he is an honest, trustworthy man who is \nhardworking and dependable. (AE W)  \n \nAfter retirement, Applicant worked stateside for a defense contractor for a year, \nthrough approximately May 2004. Since then, he has lived and worked for contractors \nalmost exclusively in combat zones. (Tr. 87; AE B) He is a radar technician who is \nresponsible for the installation, upgrade, maintenance, and repair of radars and radios. \n(Tr. 89; AE B) He has held a security clearance since 1982. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s work is extremely dangerous. He lives and works on base, embedded \nwith the soldiers, and he frequently comes under enemy fire. (Tr. 80, 86) He typically \nworks 12 hours per day for seven days a week. (Tr. 89) He shares his living space, a six \nfoot by eight foot converted cargo container, with three roommates. (Tr. 91-92) Per \nApplicant\u2019s employment contract, he is allowed to take vacation leave every six months. \nHe does not always use his leave \u201cbecause the needs of the military come first.\u201d (Tr. \n125) As of the hearing date, he had been working continuously without break for more \nthan 12 months. (Tr. 125)  \n \nPer a coworker, Applicant is \u201cthe go-to guy whenever systems [go] down, and is \none of the most talented technicians with whom he has ever worked.\u201d (AE X). According \nto another coworker, whom Applicant trained, he is a highly talented individual who \nprovided an unmatched level of support for the warfighters. (AE Y) Over the years, \nApplicant has won multiple awards for exceptional performance. (AE B, AE J, AE P; Tr. \n101-102) \n \nApplicant frequently vacations in the Philippines. During the course of his travels, \nhe has become acquainted with many people including women he dated and families he \nhelped financially. As a traveler who has visited and spent significant amounts of time in \ndeveloping countries, Applicant has witnessed abject poverty. Believing that much \nforeign aid, either from the U.S. government or from international charities, is \nsquandered by corrupt officials who govern many of these countries, Applicant finds it \nmore gratifying to assist needy people directly rather than through charitable donations. \n(Tr. 132) He is particularly interested in helping people be more self-sufficient. (Tr. 173) \n\n \n5 \n                                                                                                                                              \n \nOver the years, he has helped a family in the Philippines restore electric power \nthat had been lost after a typhoon. (Tr. 136) On another occasion, he helped repair a \nhome in the Philippines that had also been damaged in a typhoon. (AE Q at 3; AE T)   \n \nApplicant is equally committed to humanitarian assistance in the United States. \n(AE U, AE V) Several years ago, he gave $1,000 to a charity to help flood victims after a \nhurricane. In addition, on one occasion, he donated $1,000 to a U.S.-based disaster \nrelief charity. (AE U)  \n \n \nIn approximately 2008, during a visit to the Philippines, Applicant, while \nshopping, noticed a teenage girl (Acquaintance (A) 1) who appeared to be \u201cin a really \nbad way.\u201d (Tr. 208)) When he asked her what was wrong, she told him that she had not \neaten in three days. Applicant then took her to a fast-food restaurant. (GE 2 at 17)  After \nApplicant left the Philippines, he corresponded with her approximately two to three \ntimes a year via the internet.  \n \n \nApplicant returned to the Philippines in 2010. He had no contact with A1. In 2011, \nApplicant returned to the Philippines, staying approximately two to three weeks. He \nvisited A1, meeting with her for 20 to 30 minutes. In 2013, when Applicant visited the \nPhilippines, he met A1\u2019s family. Noticing that they had no electricity, and a makeshift \nroof composed of tin and bamboo leaves, Applicant helped them install electric service \nand repair the roof. (Tr. 135) During the trip, Applicant also provided financial assistance \nto A1. He helped send her to sewing school, and he paid her $2,500 in five increments \nto help her start a 7-11 style market. Since 2013, Applicant and A1 have communicated \nsporadically by phone. (GE 2 at 18) He neither had sexual intercourse with A1, nor \npropositioned her for sex. (Tr. 207) \n \n \nWhile on a vacation to the Philippines in early 2010, as referenced in the \nparagraph above, Applicant met A2. She worked at a moped rental shop and cleaned \nhomes for a living. Shortly after meeting, they began dating and became intimately \ninvolved. Applicant saw her three times over the two weeks that he was in the \nPhilippines. (Tr. 211) After leaving the Philippines, Applicant remained in touch with her \ndaily via Skype between 2010 and 2012. (GE 2 at 14)  When Applicant was dating A2, \nhe sent her approximately $300 to help pay for medical expenses. (Tr. 169)  By 2013, \nApplicant\u2019s contact with A2 had become less frequent. He has had no contact with her \nsince March 2016. (Tr. 212) \n \n \nIn either 2010 or 2011, Applicant met A3 while visiting the Philippines. She is a \nwaitress. He dated her for three to four weeks. While dating, he gave her $1,500, \nincluding gifts, money to buy a bicycle, and sewing school tuition. After returning from \nvacation, he stayed in touch with her sporadically, but stopped after realizing that she \nwas using him to get money for her family. (GE 2 at 4)  His last contact with her was in \n2011. (GE 2 at 18) \n \n\n \n6 \n                                                                                                                                              \n \nApplicant met A4, a prostitute, while on vacation in the Philippines in October \n2011. (Tr. 209) He paid her to have sex with him. (Tr. 209) Before leaving, he \npurchased her a refrigerator and helped her start a convenience store. (Tr. 168) After \nreturning to work, he stayed in touch with her via Skype once or twice per week. (GE 2 \nat 15; Tr. 207) Their last contact consisted of e-mail correspondence exchanged over \nthe holidays in 2013. (GE 2 at 14) \n \n \nApplicant met A5, a Filipino foreign national, on an airplane in 2011. She is the \nmother of four children and works as a house cleaner. Applicant gave her $1,700 to \nhelp her pay for a contracting agency that places clients, typically from developing \ncountries, in housecleaning jobs in wealthier countries. (Tr. 168) They never had sexual \nintercourse.  \n \n \nApplicant met A6 online. They have never subsequently met in person. (Tr. 216) \nShe has a bachelor\u2019s degree in business. (GE 2 at 17) With Applicant\u2019s help, she \nstarted a pig farming business. He invested $2,500 in the business. A6 paid him back in \nthe amount of $2,800. Three hundred dollars constituted return on investment. Applicant \nentered into this arrangement approximately six to eight months after he completed the \nsecurity clearance application. Their relationship was not intimate. \n \n \nApplicant met A7 while visiting the Philippines in February 2013. They were \nintimately involved. For seven to ten days, he enjoyed his vacation with her, shopping \nand sightseeing. (Tr. 215) He gave her $4,500 to help her start a fried chicken stand. He \ngave her this money incrementally over a period of several months. (Tr. 168) Although \nthey stay in touch periodically, they have not been romantically involved since Applicant \nfirst met her in 2013. His last contact with her was by phone in September 2018. (Tr. \n215) \n \n \nApplicant met A8 on the same trip that he met A7. He stayed in touch with her \ntwice per month electronically after returning from vacation. They have had no contact \nsince the fall of 2013. (GE 2 at 19) Their relationship was not intimate. \n \n \nApplicant met A9 while traveling to the Philippines in April 2013. She is a \nconstruction worker. Their relationship was not sexual. Applicant gave her between \n$800 and $1,600 to help pay for her diabetes treatment. (GE 2 at 17) After he returned \nfrom vacation, they initially stayed in touch several times per week via texting or Skype. \nTheir contact gradually decreased to electronic communication twice per month.  They \nare not currently in touch. \n \n \nApplicant met A10 on the same trip to the Philippines in 2013 that he met A9. \nShe is a restaurant hostess. Applicant had an intimate relationship with her. They spent \nthree days together dining out, shopping, and visiting her at her home. After Applicant \nreturned to base from vacation, they communicated electronically approximately twice a \nmonth through January 2014. (GE 2 at 17) In approximately April 2014, Applicant gave \nher $500 to help her pay her rent. (GE 2 at 17-18) \n \n\n \n7 \n                                                                                                                                              \n \nIn approximately 2014, Applicant purchased a condo in the Philippines for \n$34,000 USD. (Tr. 116) It is roughly the size of a hotel suite. (AE R) Applicant \npurchased it because, given the frequency that he visits the Philippines, it is cheaper to \nown a condo rather than to pay hotel costs for each trip. (Tr. 123) Also, the Philippines \nis \u201ca great jumping off spot to travel to other locations\u201d around the world. (Tr. 124) The \ncondo\u2019s current value is approximately $8,000 USD. (Tr. 123) Applicant does not rent it \nto anyone when he is not occupying it. (Tr. 125) \n \n \nApplicant has money deposited in seven bank accounts. Five bank accounts are \nin the United States and two of the bank accounts are in the Philippines. (Tr. 107) \nCollectively, he has approximately $8,000 USD deposited in the Philippines accounts. \nHe opened the first account to facilitate the purchase of his condo in 2014. (Tr. 111; AE \nD at 3) He uses it to pay condo fees, utilities, and property taxes. Now, he uses it for his \nvacation expenses. He opened the account, in part, to avoid exorbitant ATM conversion \nfees that his U.S. bank charges for foreign transactions. Applicant opened the second \nbank account in the Philippines to take advantage of a perk in which the bank waives \nthe $100 USD fee that the country charges foreign visitors seeking to apply for visa \nextensions. (Tr. 112) \n \n \nApplicant purchased his primary property in the United States in 2007. Because \nhe is home only once every 18 to 24 months, he generally keeps it boarded. Applicant \nrents his other two U.S. properties.  (Tr. 118) Applicant\u2019s combined annual salary and \nretirement income totals approximately $322,000.  (Tr. 103; AE D at 3) His net worth is \n1.7 million dollars. \n \n \nFor approximately four months in 2012, before taking his current job, and after \nfinishing his previous job in a combat zone, Applicant performed contract work in \nFinland. (Tr. 87) While there, he became romantically involved with a waitress who was \na citizen of Thailand. He had sex with her twice. Their relationship never became close \nbecause of their language barrier. \n \n \nIn the past, Applicant considered settling down, moving to the Philippines and \npursuing a serious relationship with a Filipino woman. Now, he is no longer interested in \nmarrying anyone from the Philippines because of the communication gap that he has \nfound which often exists between him and the women he has dated over the years. He \nno longer visits his ex-girlfriends when he travels to the Philippines. He now \nunderstands that the only reason many of them want to \u201chang out\u201d with him is because \nof the possibility that he may buy them good food and great gifts. (Tr. 140)  As for \nrelocating to the Philippines, Applicant ruled this out because his condo is too small. \nAfter living for years in a cramped, Spartan space while working on base, he prefers to \npurchase a home where he can \u201cspread his legs out.\u201d (Tr. 231) Applicant occasionally \n\u201cget[s] random contacts out of the clear blue, but there\u2019s nothing close to close and \ncontinuing happening\u201d with any of the women he has met while traveling to the \nPhilippines. (Tr. 213) \n \n\n \n8 \n                                                                                                                                              \n \nWhile Applicant was working in Finland, he took a ferry boat ride to Estonia and \nstayed there for two to three days. He spent the time in Estonia sightseeing. (Tr. 86, \n177)  \n \n \nApplicant completed a security clearance application in September 2012. He \nanswered \u201cno\u201d in response to Section 20B, which required him to disclose foreign \ninterests. (See Preliminary Ruling Section, supra) The SOR alleges that he failed to \ndisclose business consulting and financial support he provided to several women who \nwere citizens and residents of the Philippines. Applicant contends that whatever advice \nhe gave to Filipino women that he helped start businesses was limited to basic \ncommon-sense suggestions such as reminding them not to forget to subtract inventory \ncosts from sales revenue when calculating profit. (Tr. 173) Applicant also testified that \nany profit from their businesses was so small by U.S. standards that if he were to have \nrequested a share, it \u201cwould [have] defeat[ed] the purpose . . . of trying to help them.\u201d \n(Tr. 167)  \n \nApplicant did receive a return on his investment in the pig farming business. \nApplicant helped the Filipino woman with the pig farming venture after he completed the \nsecurity clearance application. He earned $300 from the investment. \n \nIn response to Section 20C of Applicant\u2019s security clearance application, \nregarding whether he had travelled outside of the United States in the past seven years, \nhe answered, \u201cyes.\u201d In the second question under Section 20C, asking whether the \nforeign travel was solely for Government business, Applicant also answered \u201cyes.\u201d (GE \n1 at 28) The Government alleges in SOR subparagraph 2.k that Applicant\u2019s failure to \ndisclose trips to the Philippines in 2010 and 2011, a trip to Estonia in 2012, and a trip to \nFinland in July 2012 constitutes a falsification. Applicant testified that he always \nreported his foreign travel to his supervisor per company policy, and that his facility \nsecurity officer (FSO) told him that he was only required to list travel to adversarial \ncountries. (AE M; AE Q at 2; Tr. 174-175)  \n \nAdministrative Notice \n \n \nThe Philippine government is a multi-party, constitutional republic with a \nbicameral legislature. (HE IV at 1) The relationship between the United States and the \nPhilippines is based on a strong historical and cultural link. (HE XII) The United States \nand the Philippines maintain a robust relationship through several person-to-person \ncultural exchanges sponsored by both governments, as well as non-governmental \norganizations. (Id.) Approximately 220,000 U.S. citizens live in the Philippines. (Id.) \nManila, the capital of the Philippines, is home to the only U.S. Bureau of Veterans \nAffairs office and health care clinic outside of the United States. (HE XI at 1-2) The \nlargest U.S. cemetery outside of the United States is in the Philippines. \n \n \nManila is a high-threat location for crime directed at, or affecting U.S. government \ninterests. (HE VII at 1) The U.S. Department of State advises all U.S. citizens \ncontemplating travel to the Philippines to exercise increased caution due to crime, \n\n \n9 \n                                                                                                                                              \nterrorism, and civil unrest. (HE VIII) Certain regions of the Philippines have been acutely \naffected by Islamic State-sponsored terrorism.  (HE V) The Philippines government has \nconsistently acknowledged the danger from such groups and has welcomed assistance \nfrom the United States. (HE V)  \n \n \nAlthough the Philippines is a democratic republic, its human rights record is poor. \nOver an 18-month period between July 2016 and October 2017, government agents \nand their informal allies arbitrarily and unlawfully killed thousands of people allegedly \nconnected to the distribution of illegal drugs. (HE IV at 2) Other problems include torture \nof prisoners, life-threatening prison conditions, arbitrary jailing of political prisoners, and \nwarrantless arrests by security forces. (HE IV at 1) \n \nPolicies \n \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the \nExecutive Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security \nemphasizing, \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. \nEgan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the \nauthority to control access to information bearing on national security and to determine \nwhether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. \nat 527. The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d  Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended.    \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable.  \n \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if they must, \non the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline B, Foreign Influence \n \n  \nUnder this guideline, \u201cforeign contacts and interests, including, but not limited to, \nbusiness, financial, and property interests, are a national security concern if they result \nin divided allegiance.\u201d (AG \u00b6 6) The following disqualifying conditions are potentially \napplicable under AG \u00b6 7: \n\n \n10 \n                                                                                                                                              \n \n(a) contact, regardless of method, with a foreign family member, \nbusiness or professional associate, friend, or other person who is a \ncitizen of or resident in a foreign country if that contact creates a \nheightened risk of foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, \npressure, or coercion; and \n \n(f) substantial business, financial, or property interests in a foreign \ncountry, or in any foreign-owned or foreign-operated business that could \nsubject the individual to a heightened risk of foreign influence or \nexploitation or personal conflict of interest.  \n \n  \nThe Philippines is an ally of the United States and is a partner in fighting \nterrorism. However, terrorism and civil unrest is pervasive in parts of the country, crime \nis rampant, and the government has a history of brutally disregarding the human rights \nof its citizens in enforcing the rule of law. Under these circumstances, Applicant\u2019s \nrelationship with girlfriends over the years and various other people whom he has \nhelped financially, raises the issue of whether AG \u00b6 7(a) applies, and Applicant\u2019s \nproperty interest in the Philippines raises the issue of whether AG \u00b6 7(f) applies. \n \n  \nNone of Applicant\u2019s romantic relationships were long-term or serious. Although \nApplicant spent thousands of dollars over the years helping Filipino citizens and \nresidents, buying gifts for his then-girlfriends and helping them financially, this money \nwas minimal in relation to his total net worth. The most recent evidence of a romantic \nrelationship with a citizen and resident of the Philippines occurred approximately five \nyears ago. Any residual contact with ex-girlfriends is casual and infrequent. \nConsequently, the casual, infrequent nature of Applicant\u2019s relationship with his friends \nand acquaintances who are citizens and residents of the Philippines renders the \npossibility of foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion \nminimal. AG \u00b6 7(a) does not apply. Assuming for the sake of argument that the \nconcerns about crime, terrorism, and human rights abuses in the Philippines were \nsufficient to trigger the application of AG \u00b6 7(a), it is mitigated by AG \u00b6 8(c), \u201ccontact or \ncommunication with foreign citizens is so casual and infrequent that there is little \nlikelihood that it could create a risk for foreign influence or exploitation.\u201d I resolve \nsubparagraphs 1.a and 1.b in Applicant\u2019s favor. \n \n  \nThe value of Applicant\u2019s condo and his bank accounts in the Philippines are \nminimal in relation to the value of his properties in the United States and to his total net \nworth. Consequently, the possibility that it could create the potential for coercion, \ninfluence, or exploitation is minimal. AG \u00b6 8(f), \u201cthe value or routine nature of the foreign \nbusiness, financial, or property interests is such that they are unlikely to result in a \nconflict and could not be used to effectively influence, manipulate, or pressure the \nindividual,\u201d applies. I resolve SOR subparagraph 1.d and 1.e in Applicant\u2019s favor.  \n \n  \nA clear and accurate assessment of a country\u2019s geo-political position vis a vis the \nUnited States is crucial in a heightened risk analysis. (ISCR Case No. 05-11292 at 4, \n\n \n11 \n                                                                                                                                              \nn.1 (App. Bd. Apr. 12, 2007) The Government presented no such evidence about either \nThailand or Finland. Under these circumstances, Applicant\u2019s past relationship with a \nThai citizen residing in Finland does not generate a security concern. I resolve SOR \nsubparagraph 1.c in Applicant\u2019s favor. \n \n  \nApplicant disclosed that he has met several women during his foreign travels on \nhis 2012 security clearance application. He identified and discussed his relationships \nwith them comprehensively during the investigative process. Consequently, I resolve \nSOR subparagraph 1.f, alleging that he failed to report association with foreign \nnationals, in his favor. In sum, Applicant has mitigated the Guideline B security concern. \n  \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \n \n  \nUnder this guideline, \u201cconduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, \ndishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified or \nsensitive information.\u201d (AG \u00b6 15) Moreover, \u201cof special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security investigative \nor adjudicative processes.\u201d (Id.) \n \n  \nThe personal conduct security concern is not applicable to Applicant\u2019s purchase \nof property in the Philippines to use during his occasional visits because it is not \nreflective of dishonesty, untrustworthiness, or bad judgment. Any security concerns \nregarding the property were addressed under the Guideline B section above. \n \n  \nApplicant is a single man who has lived nearly continuously in combat zones for \nthe past 15 years, working seven days per week for his employer under extraordinarily \nstressful and austere conditions. These facts, together with his testimony, lead me to \nconclude that emotional fulfillment was not what Applicant was primarily seeking when \nhe entered into romantic relationships with his various paramours in the Philippines \nduring his brief vacation time over the years. Conversely, he was not intimately involved \nwith every woman he met while vacationing in the Philippines, and he assisted them \nfinancially regardless of whether he was having sexual intercourse with them. Moreover, \nhe has not had an intimate relationship with any citizens and residents of the Philippines \nin approximately five years. Applicant has a history of helping people in need, giving \n$2,000 over the years to U.S. charities to help flood victims. Under these \ncircumstances, the altruism Applicant demonstrated by helping women when visiting the \nPhilippines was not diminished by whether or not he was romantically involved with \nthem. I conclude that SOR subparagraph 2.g generates no security concern. \n \n  \nAs for Applicant\u2019s response to Section 20B of his security clearance application \nregarding foreign interests in the Philippines, Applicant\u2019s help to Philippine foreign \nnationals consisted of financial support to help them start businesses or attend trade \nschool. The advice that he has occasionally provided to them over the years was limited \nto innocuous, common-sense suggestions. Under these circumstances, I conclude that \n\n \n12 \n                                                                                                                                              \nApplicant did not falsify Section 20B of his security clearance application, as alleged in \nSOR subparagraph 2.j.  \n \n  \nApplicant\u2019s FSO told him that he was only required to report foreign trips to \nadversarial countries. He always reported his foreign travel to his supervisor in advance \nof his trips. Under these circumstances, I conclude that his failure to disclose two trips to \nthe Philippines, a trip to Finland, and a trip to Estonia,  when he answered \u201cno\u201d to \nQuestion 20C regarding foreign, non-work related travel over the past seven years, did \nnot constitute a falsification, and at worst, constituted a careless, but honest mistake. In \nreaching this conclusion, I considered his explanation, together with his forthcoming \nresponses to the other security clearance application questions, and his good character. \nI conclude Applicant has mitigated the personal conduct security concerns. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nApplicant has held a security clearance for more than 35 years, and he has spent \nnearly his entire adult life serving the country, first as an enlisted Airman, and after \nretirement, as a contractor, working nearly year round in combat zones for the past 15 \nyears. While working abroad, Applicant has largely sacrificed a conventional, \ncomfortable life stateside for an ascetic life with the near-constant threat of physical \nharm. I considered these facts in assessing his credibility, and in my disposition of the \ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions of the alleged guidelines.  \n \n \nFormal Finding \n \nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:          \n \n  \nParagraph 1, Guideline B:   \n \n \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n  \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.f:  \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n  \n \n \n \n\n \n13 \n                                                                                                                                              \n  \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \n \n \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n  \nSubparagraphs 2.g \u2013 2.k:  \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with the security interests of the United States to grant Applicant \neligibility for a security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is \ngranted. \n \n \n__________________________ \nMarc Curry \nAdministrative Judge \n",

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant is 59 years old and employed by a defense contractor. He is married, with no children. Applicant was honorably retired from the Air Force as a technical sergeant (E-6) in 2001, and has an Associate of Arts degree. He is seeking to retain national security eligibility for a security clearance in connection with his employment. (Government Exhibit 1 at Sections 12, 13C, 15, 17.) Paragraph 1 (Guideline I, Psychological Conditions) The Government alleges in this paragraph that Applicant is ineligible for clearance because he suffers from an emotional, mental or personality condition that can impair his judgment, reliability or trustworthiness. Applicant admitted all the allegations in the SOR with explanations. He also submitted additional documentation to support a finding of national security eligibility. Applicant\u2019s mental health issues were first identified when he attempted to commit suicide on November 14, 2009. He changed his mind, called the police, and was committed to a hospital for observation and mental health treatment. (Government Exhibits 6, 7; Tr. 31.) Applicant was discharged from the hospital on November 25, 2009, with a diagnosis of Major Depressive Disorder, Recurrent, Severe, With Psychotic Features. Progress notes from his hospitalization are found in Government Exhibit 8. The notes are replete with statements by Applicant that he felt he was being covertly observed, even while he was in the hospital. (See Tr. 33.) 3 Pertinent exce",

(Government Exhibit 1.) On December 28, 2017, \nthe Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications Facility (DoD CAF) issued a \nStatement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant, detailing security concerns under Guideline I \n(Psychological Conditions). The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information Within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; \nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security \nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the National \nSecurity Adjudication Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified \n \n\n \n \n2 \n \n \nInformation or Eligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position, effective within the Department of \nDefense after June 8, 2017. \n  \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing (Answer) on January 22, 2018, and \nrequested a hearing before an administrative judge. Department Counsel was prepared \nto proceed on March 1, 2018. The case was assigned to me on March 7, 2018. The \nDefense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Notice of Hearing on March \n15, 2018. I convened the hearing as scheduled on April 25, 2018. The Government \noffered Government Exhibits 1 through 10, which were admitted without objection. \nApplicant offered Applicant Exhibits A through C, which were admitted without objection, \nand testified on his own behalf. DOHA received the transcript of the hearing on May 3, \n2018.  \n  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant is 59 years old and employed by a defense contractor. He is married, \nwith no children. Applicant was honorably retired from the Air Force as a technical \nsergeant (E-6) in 2001, and has an Associate of Arts degree. He is seeking to retain \nnational security eligibility for a security clearance in connection with his employment. \n(Government Exhibit 1 at Sections 12, 13C, 15, 17.)  \n \nParagraph 1 (Guideline I, Psychological Conditions) \n \n \nThe Government alleges in this paragraph that Applicant is ineligible for clearance \nbecause he suffers from an emotional, mental or personality condition that can impair his \njudgment, reliability or trustworthiness. Applicant admitted all the allegations in the SOR \nwith explanations. He also submitted additional documentation to support a finding of \nnational security eligibility. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s mental health issues were first identified when he attempted to commit \nsuicide on November 14, 2009. He changed his mind, called the police, and was \ncommitted to a hospital for observation and mental health treatment. (Government \nExhibits 6, 7; Tr. 31.) \n \n \nApplicant was discharged from the hospital on November 25, 2009, with a \ndiagnosis of Major Depressive Disorder, Recurrent, Severe, With Psychotic Features. \nProgress notes from his hospitalization are found in Government Exhibit 8. The notes are \nreplete with statements by Applicant that he felt he was being covertly observed, even \nwhile he was in the hospital. (See Tr. 33.) \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n3 \n \n \n \nPertinent excerpts from his Discharge Summary (Government Exhibit 9) are as \nfollows: \n \nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: This is a 50-year-old Caucasian male \nwith no past psychiatric diagnosis. He was brought in by police on a 5150 \nfor danger to self after patient [Applicant] cut both of his wrists superficially \nand was observed to be sitting in warm water in a bathtub. The patient \nstated, \u201cI cut a little more initially, but it didn\u2019t work. I got scared and called \nthe police.\u201d The patient stated that he had been feeling that people were \nfollowing him for the last year and a half. The patient believed they were \nmilitary personnel. The patient was unsure why they were following him, but \nthey were looking at him in the home as well as following him around \nwherever he went. The patient stated he believed he was being monitored, \n\u201cBecause I stare at children too long.\u201d . . . The patient denied auditory or \nvisual hallucinations. The patient however was preoccupied with his \ndelusions to the point of feeling that people were following him even in the \nhospital. The patient reported history of recurrent episodes of depression, \nbut no psychosis in the past. . . The patient stated that he felt that he needed \nto kill himself to save his wife.  \n \n \nThe hospital records further state, under \u201cCOURSE OF HOSPITALIZATION\u201d: \n \nThe patient demonstrated gradual improvement to his symptoms with \ntreatment. . . The patient reported significant decrease in the intensity and \nfrequency of his paranoid delusions. The patient states that he was no \nlonger bothered by them. The patient initially had thoughts of ending his life \nto save his wife. The patient, however, reported resolution of any suicidal or \nhomicidal ideations.  \n \n \nApplicant was prescribed drugs, and also advised to obtain counseling. He \ncontinues on a drug regimen, as well as counseling, as further described below. \n(Applicant Exhibits A and B.) \n \n \nApplicant was interviewed by an investigator for the Office of Personnel \nManagement (OPM) on September 11, 2014. The investigator prepared a Report of \nInvestigation \n(ROI), \nwhich \nstated \nas \nfollows \nconcerning \nApplicant\u2019s \n\u201cPSYCHOLOGICAL/EMOTIONAL HEALTH\u201d: \n \nThe subject\u2019s anxiety stems from the constant feeling that people are \nwatching him, at work, going to the bathroom, at home, when he is driving, \nto \u201csuggest he is doing things he isn\u2019t supposed to do\u201d in order to get rid of \nhim. The subject could not elaborate on what he meant by \u201cthings he isn\u2019t \nsupposed to do.\u201d These feelings first started in about 2003 date not recalled, \nat home, then in about 2005, date not recalled, at work. The subject has \nspoken with his supervisor about his belief that people are watching him to \n\n \n \n4 \n \n \nget him on something. The subject\u2019s supervisor has told the subject that no \none is trying to watch him or get things on him. The subject thinks that his \nsupervisor thinks he is \u201ca bit off.\u201d The subject has not had any disciplinary \nactions or confrontations. (See Tr. 26-27.) \n \nThe subject\u2019s counseling and medication have helped him to understand \nthat people are not out to get him, but he still can\u2019t help getting the feeling \nthat people are watching him. (Government Exhibit 2 at 2.)  \n \n \nBased in part on this interview a staff psychologist at the DoD CAF recommended \nthat Applicant receive a medical evaluation. The psychologist stated, \u201cEven in the face of \nthe very limited favorable medical testimony, a concern exists about the subject\u2019s \njudgment and reliability based upon his intrusive thoughts/anxieties he expressed to the \nOPM investigator during his 11 SEP 14 PSI [Personal Subject Interview].\u201d (Government \nExhibit 4.) \n \n \nApplicant received a psychological evaluation from a licensed psychologist/clinical \nneuropsychologist (Evaluator) on November 3 and 10, 2017. (See Tr. 36.) The \nEvaluator\u2019s report is Government Exhibit 3. Pertinent excerpts from this document are as \nfollows: \n \nCOLLATERAL INTERVIEWS (CONDUCTED BY PHONE): \n \n[Applicant] provided a signed authorization for this evaluator to speak with \nhis treating psychiatrist Dr. [A]. On November 8, 2017, Dr. [A] reported that \n[Applicant] is being treated for Major Depressive Disorder, recurrent, \nsevere, with psychotic features and Delusional Disorder. He has been \ntreating [Applicant] since December 2009. Dr. [A] first began providing \ntreatment on a monthly basis and reduced it to one time every two months. \n[Applicant] is reported to be consistent with is appointments. The current \nprescribed psychotropic medications are as follows: Risperdal .5 mg, \nWellbutrin 150 mg, Lexapro 20 mg, and Klonopin .5 mg. Dr. [A] is aware of \n[Applicant\u2019s] persecutory/paranoid delusions, and reports Risperdal .5 mg \nis a low dose, but he has been unable to increase the dose due to reported \nside-effects. Dr. [A], reports Risperdal is about the only antipsychotic \nmedication that [Applicant] will tolerate. Some of the paranoid delusions that \nDr. [A] is aware of are as follows: Co-workers are talking about him, playing \ngames with him, his work is trying to fire him, he is being monitored by his \ncomputer and his telephone. Dr. [A] reports that [Applicant] is guarded and \ndoes not go into detail about the paranoid delusions. Dr. [A] reports that he \ndoes not believe that there would be a problem in [Applicant\u2019s] judgment or \nreliability in safeguarding secret/confidential information because of the \nfollowing: He has known [Applicant] for so long, he is able to perform his \njob, has been relatively free of disciplinary actions, has not been fired from \nhis job, and [Applicant] is at baseline/not deteriorating. \n\n \n \n5 \n \n \nBRIEF HISTORY OF RELEVENT ISSUES:   \n \n \n \n \n \n. \n. \n. \n. \n \n \nAlthough he continues to work as a . . . Assistant Site Manager, and \nhas been with the same company for many years, [Applicant] reports having \nthe following complaints (persecutory/paranoid delusions): His work is \ntrying to fire him because he stares at women too long; co-workers are \ntalking about him, playing games with him; he is being monitored by his \ncomputer and his telephone, \u201cPeople are working on getting me fired; they \ntrack how many times I look at women; security guards on the base can \nread my mind or put things in my mind.\u201d [Applicant] reports ongoing \ntreatment with Dr. [A], psychiatrist, for medication management, and [Dr. B], \nPhD, MFCC, for individual therapy. [Applicant] reports ongoing discussions, \non the above ideations, with both treatment providers. Dr. [A] reports he is \naware of the above delusions.  \n \n \nPSYCHOLOGICAL EVALUATION/TESTING RESULTS:  \n \nMental Status Exam: . . . [Applicant] reported suffering stress due to people \nat his work trying to get him fired . . . No obvious or unusual anxiety \nsymptoms were noticed, beyond closing his eyes when reporting paranoid \nideations. [Applicant\u2019s] thought process was linear; his thought content was \nirrational when discussing paranoid delusions; thought content was relevant \nto the topic being discussed. . . . \n \nPersonality Assessment Inventory (PAI): This evaluator administered the \nPAI to [Applicant], which resulted in a valid profile, validity indices were well \nwithin the normal range, suggesting that he answered in a consistent \nmanner, attended appropriately to the item content, and had an ability to \nidentify positive and negative qualities/attributes about himself. \n \n[Applicant] elevated several of the clinical scales, indicating that he suffers \nfrom significant anxiety, depression, and psychotic symptoms. The most \nsignificantly elevated clinical scales suggest that [Applicant] is hypervigilant \nand overly suspicious; he spends much time monitoring his environment for \nevidence that others are trying to harm or discredit him. He also has \npersecutory beliefs that people are plotting against him in some sort of \nconspiracy (e.g., \u201cPeople want to fire me\u201d). People may view him as odd \nand eccentric, due to his hypervigilance and unconventional ideas. As a \nresult of his paranoid ideations (e.g., \u201cSecurity guards on base can read my \nmind and put things in my mind\u201d) and related anxiety, he socially isolates \nand detaches, which may serve to decrease his social discomfort. \n \n \n \n \n \n. \n. \n. \n. \n\n \n \n6 \n \n \nAlthough he is not aware that many of his thoughts are delusional in nature, \nhe acknowledges that he has major emotional difficulties and believes he \nneeds help.  \n \n \nBased on the foregoing, under the section \u201cDIAGNOSTIC IMPRESSIONS,\u201d the \nEvaluator found the following diagnoses, which are consistent with those of Dr. A, set \nforth above: Major Depressive Disorder, recurrent, severe, with psychotic features; and, \nDelusional Disorder, Persecutory Type.  \n \n \nThe report concludes: \n \nIMMEDIATE AND LONG-TERM PROGNOSIS \n \nLong-term prognosis is fair if [Applicant] is willing/able to tolerate an \nincrease \nin \nRisperdal \n(or \nanother \nantipsychotic \nmedication \nas \nrecommended by Dr. [A]). In the past, [Applicant] adhered to a higher dose \nof Risperdal, resulting in an improved mental state and stability. However, \nat this time, [Applicant\u2019s] immediate prognosis is poor. He continues to have \nsignificant paranoid delusions, depressed mood, anxiety, and periodic \nsuicide ideation. Insight into his delusions is currently poor. There is \ncurrently significant interpersonal functional impairment in [Applicant\u2019s] life. \nHe also has a history of occupational difficulties (e.g., Unable to work as a \nresult of psychiatric hospitalization in 2009, security clearance was revoked \nin 2009) without mental health treatment. Without an increase in Risperdal \n(or another antipsychotic), his prognosis is likely to remain poor. \n \nCONCLUSIONS/RECOMMENDATIONS \n \nAt this time, [Applicant\u2019s] current mental state and functioning impacts his \nability, reliability, judgment, stability and trustworthiness in handling or \nsafeguarding classified information. I agree with Dr. [A] that [Applicant] is \nable to perform his job, and does not have a history of aggression or being \nfired from his place of employment. However, [Applicant] is not in touch with \nreality, at this time, due to his continued paranoid delusions; furthermore, \nhe continues to experience depression and anxiety, and periodic suicide \nideation; this dysregulation of neurotransmitters could affect the frontal \nlobes, and areas involved in decision making and metacognition. As a result \nof his current mental state, and poor insight, there is significant concern that \n[Applicant] could pose a risk of unauthorized disclosure or mishandling of \nclassified information.  \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n7 \n \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s treating psychiatrist, Dr. A, provided a written statement dated April 23, \n2018. It is Applicant Exhibit A and reads as follows: \n \nPlease be advised that [Applicant] has been under my psychiatric care since \n12/15/2009 for the medication management of major depression with \npsychotic features and the delusional disorder, persecutory type. He is seen \nevery one to two months for medication management and his current \nmedications are Lexapro 20 mg at bedtime, Zyprexa 2.5 mg at bedtime and \nKlonopin 0.5 mg as needed.2 [Applicant] attends his sessions regularly and \nhas \nbeen \ncompliant \nwith \nthe \nrecommendations \nfor \nmedication \nmanagement.  \n \n \nApplicant testified that his psychiatrist had changed his prescription from Risperdal \nto Zyprexa because of some suicidal thoughts he was having. He also thought that Dr. A \nput him on Zyprexa because of the recommendation from the Evaluator that Applicant\u2019s \nmedication either be changed or increased. (Tr. 37-38.) \n \n \nApplicant also has a treating psychologist, Dr. B, who also submitted a written \nstatement, dated March 22, 2018. He has been seeing Applicant since approximately \n2005. (Tr. 25, 38-39.) The statement is Applicant Exhibit B and reads as follows: \n \nI am writing this letter to confirm that [Applicant] has been in individual \ncounseling with me. [Applicant] has been showing good progress in dealing \nwith his anxiety issues. We have been utilizing Cognitive Behavioral \nTherapy and Solution Focused Therapy as the basis for affecting change in \nhis life. [Applicant] reports improvement in dealing with the stressors of his \nlife. He is a very willing and cooperative client who has an excellent \nprognosis. \n \n \nApplicant testified concerning his issues at some length. He confirmed that his \nissues began in 2004 or 2005 with a constant feeling that people were watching him at \nwork, while going to the bathroom, at home, while he was driving, and suggesting that he \nwas doing things he wasn\u2019t supposed to be doing. Applicant testified that he continued to \nhave these feelings today about his fellow workers. He also believed at the time of the \nhearing that such observation was being done covertly by his management and \ninvestigators, though not as much as during earlier days. (Tr. 24-32.)  \n \n \n \n                                                 \n2 I take administrative notice of the following facts concerning the drugs that are currently prescribed for \nApplicant. Lexapro is an anti-depressant. (WebMD, Lexapro, https://www.webmd.com/drugs/2/drug-\n63990/lexapro-oral/details (accessed December 28, 2018).) Zyprexa is an anti-psychotic. (WebMD, \nZyprexa, https://www.webmd.com/drugs/2/drug-1699/zyprexa-oral/details (accessed December 28, \n2018).)  Klonopin is used to treat panic disorder and anxiety. (WebMD, Klonopin, https://www.webmd.com/ \ndrugs/2/drug-920-6006/klonopin-oral/clonazepam-oral/details (accessed December 28, 2018).) \n\n \n \n8 \n \n \n \nApplicant testified that he did not believe the security guards at work were reading \nhis mind and putting thoughts in his head. He further testified: \n \nThere\u2019s this one Security outfit that has some kind of device or something, \nif you\u2019ve seen on the news and whatnot. They\u2019ve had ways where they can \ngo, where people can go and use hearing \u2013 brain-connecting hearing aids \n\u2013 to brain waves so deaf people can hear and whatnot. So, it\u2019s not really a \nstretch for those same waves to be \u2013 if they have the right frequency \u2013 could \ngo and listen and understand them. (Tr. 46.) \n \n \nHe was asked by me, \u201cAnd you believe this is happening with you?\u201d Applicant \nresponded, \u201cIt happened yes.\u201d I also asked him, \u201cIs it currently happening, or in the past?\u201d \nApplicant stated, \u201cIn the past, yes, Your Honor.\u201d (Ibid.) \n \n \n \nApplicant provided a letter of recommendation from a retired member of the Air \nForce who knows Applicant well. The writer met Applicant at church, believes Applicant \nto be a trustworthy person, and recommends him to receive national security eligibility. \n(Applicant Exhibit C; Tr. 39-40.) \n \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for national security eligibility, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines (AG) list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility. \n \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. The entire \nprocess is a conscientious scrutiny of applicable guidelines in the context of a number of \nvariables known as the whole-person concept. The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires, \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. I have not drawn inferences based on mere speculation or \nconjecture.  \n \n\n \n \n9 \n \n \n \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.14, requires the Government to present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, \u201cThe applicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d  \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants national \nsecurity eligibility. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the \napplicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as \nto potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified or sensitive information. \nFinally, as emphasized in \u00a7 7 of Executive Order 10865, \u201cAny determination under this \norder adverse to an applicant shall be a determination in terms of the national interest \nand shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d \nSee also Executive Order 12968, \u00a7 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access to \nclassified or sensitive information.) \n \n \nAnalysis \n \nParagraph 1 (Guideline I, Psychological Conditions) \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Psychological Conditions is set \nout in AG \u00b6 27: \n \nCertain emotional, mental, and personality conditions can impair judgment, \nreliability, or trustworthiness. A formal diagnosis of a disorder is not required \nfor there to be a concern under this guideline. A duly qualified mental health \nprofessional (e.g., clinical psychologist or psychiatrist) employed by, or \nacceptable to and approved by the U.S. Government, should be consulted \nwhen evaluating potentially disqualifying and mitigating information under \nthis guideline and an opinion, including prognosis, should be sought. No \nnegative inference concerning the standards in this guideline may be raised \nsolely on the basis of mental health counseling. \n \nThe guideline at AG \u00b6 28 contains five conditions that could raise a security \nconcern and may be disqualifying. Three conditions are established: \n \n(a) behavior that casts doubt on an individual's judgment, stability, reliability, \nor trustworthiness, not covered under any other guideline and that may \nindicate an emotional, mental, or personality condition, including, but not \n\n \n \n10 \n \n \nlimited to, irresponsible, violent, self-harm, suicidal, paranoid, manipulative, \nimpulsive, chronic lying, deceitful, exploitative, or bizarre behaviors;  \n \n(b) an opinion by a duly qualified mental health professional that the \nindividual has a condition that may impair judgment, stability, reliability or \ntrustworthiness; and \n \n(c) voluntary or involuntary inpatient hospitalization. \n \n \nApplicant has been suffering from several diagnosed, severe, mental health \nconditions since at least 2009. He was psychiatrically hospitalized at that time because \nof a suicide attempt. His diagnosed conditions include major depression with psychotic \nfeatures, and a delusional disorder, persecutory type. These delusions are specifically \nrelated to his work, where he believes he is being covertly watched, that his management \nis conspiring against him, and that a security outfit has been able to use a device to read \nhis mind and put ideas into his head. Applicant testified about his delusions, which he \ncontinues to believe. In addition, Government Exhibit 3 is an extensive report from a DoD-\napproved mental health consultant who opined that Applicant\u2019s conditions are not under \ncontrol and may impair his judgment, stability, reliability, and trustworthiness. \n \nThe guideline at AG \u00b6 29 contains four conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns: \n \n(a) the identified condition is readily controllable with treatment, and the \nindividual has demonstrated ongoing and consistent compliance with the \ntreatment plan; \n \n(b) the individual has voluntarily entered a counseling or treatment program \nfor a condition that is amenable to treatment, and the individual is currently \nreceiving counseling or treatment with a favorable prognosis by a duly \nqualified mental health professional; \n \n(c) recent opinion by a duly qualified mental health professional employed \nby, or acceptable to and approved by, the U.S. Government that an \nindividual's previous condition is under control or in remission, and has a \nlow probability of recurrence or exacerbation; and \n \n(e) there is no indication of a current problem. \n \n \nAfter evaluating all the available evidence, I find that none of these mitigating \nconditions apply with force enough to overcome the weight of evidence. First, it must be \nunderstood that there is no allegation that Applicant has ever mishandled classified \ninformation. However, that is not the determining factor in this case. \n \n\n \n \n11 \n \n \n \nMitigating condition \u00b6 29(a) does not apply because there is little to no evidence \nthat Applicant\u2019s condition is controllable with treatment. He is compliant with the treatment \nplan, but the evidence shows that he is still subject to delusions. \n \n \nMitigating condition \u00b6 29(b) does not supply sufficient mitigation because there is \nlittle evidence that the counseling Applicant is receiving has resulted in a relevant \nfavorable prognosis by either of his mental health professionals. The Government is \nconcerned with Applicant\u2019s diagnosed delusions and depressive psychosis. The letter \nfrom Dr. A merely stated that Applicant is medication compliant. Dr. B\u2019s letter stated that \nApplicant has an \u201cexcellent prognosis.\u201d However, it is noted that the letter also stated that \nApplicant is being treated by Dr. B for \u201canxiety issues,\u201d which are distinct from the \ndepressive, psychotic, and delusional mental health concerns diagnosed by the \npsychiatrist.  \n \n \nMitigating conditions \u00b6 29(c) does not apply because the Evaluator had specific \nconcerns about Applicant, set forth in Government Exhibit 3, which have not been \nanswered. He found that Applicant\u2019s condition is not under control or remission, and that \nthere was a high probability of exacerbation. \n \n \nFinally, mitigating condition \u00b6 29(e) does not apply. Based on the report of the \nEvaluator, and Applicant\u2019s testimony, there is more than sufficient evidence of a current \nproblem. \n \n \nThe simple fact is that Applicant does not currently meet the conditions for a \ngranting of national security eligibility. There is always the possibility that his condition will \nstabilize, and that he will receive a favorable prognosis specifically concerning his \ndiagnoses of major depression with psychotic features, and delusional disorder, \npersecutory type. Until that happens, he is not eligible. Paragraph 1 is found against \nApplicant.  \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant=s eligibility for a national security eligibility by considering the totality of the \napplicant=s conduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should \nconsider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG & 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual=s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n\n \n \n12 \n \n \n \nUnder AG & 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant national security \neligibility for a security clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon \ncareful consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.    \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \npertinent facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant has not mitigated the \nconcerns regarding his psychological conditions, which are involuntary but serious and \nlikely to continue. Overall, the record evidence creates substantial doubt as to Applicant=s \npresent suitability for national security eligibility, and a security clearance. \n \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by & E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline I:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a through 1.d:  \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant=s national \nsecurity eligibility for a security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is \ndenied. \n                                                \n \n \n \n \nWILFORD H. ROSS \nAdministrative Judge \n",

    "summary": "Findings of Fact2 In Applicant\u2019s answer to the SOR, she admitted the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.f. She did not admit or deny the delinquent debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.g. Her admissions have been incorporated in my findings of fact. Applicant is a 37-year-old employee of a federal contractor.

Eligibility for a public trust position is denied. \nStatement of the Case \nApplicant submitted an application for a public trust position on September 29, \n2014. On September 17, 2017, the Department of Defense (DOD) sent her a Statement \nof Reasons (SOR), citing trustworthiness concerns under Guideline F. DOD acted under \nDOD acted under DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security \nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the \nadjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated in Security Executive Agent Directive 4, \nNational Security Adjudicative Guidelines (December 10, 2016). \nApplicant answered the SOR on October 17, 2017, and requested a hearing before \nan administrative judge. Applicant was separated from employment on April 19, 2018, \nand processing of the case was terminated for lack of jurisdiction.  \n1 Applicant married after the Statement of Reasons (SOR) was issued. This decision is captioned with her \nmarried name instead of the name reflected in the SOR. \n01/30/2019\n\n2 \n \nApplicant was employed by another defense contractor on November 7, 2018, and \nthe case was reopened and assigned to me on November 15, 2018. The Defense Office \nof Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) sent her a notice of hearing on November 26, 2018, \nscheduling the hearing for December 19, 2018. I convened the hearing as scheduled. \nGovernment Exhibits (GX) 1 through 5 were admitted in evidence without objection. \nApplicant testified and submitted Applicant\u2019s Exhibit (AX) A, which was admitted without \nobjection. I kept the record open until January 11, 2019, to enable her to submit additional \ndocumentary evidence. She timely submitted AX B through I, which were admitted without \nobjection. DOHA received the transcript (Tr.) on January 4, 2019. \n \nFindings of Fact2 \n \n \nIn Applicant\u2019s answer to the SOR, she admitted the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.f. \nShe did not admit or deny the delinquent debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.g. Her admissions have \nbeen incorporated in my findings of fact.  \n \n \nApplicant is a 37-year-old employee of a federal contractor. She has worked for \nher current employer since November 2018. She has never held a security clearance or \neligibility for a public trust position. \n \n \nApplicant attended college from October 2000 to September 2001 and received a \ncertificate of completion for training as a legal office assistant. She attended college from \nJanuary 2006 to August 2007 and October 2009 to September 2011 but did not receive \na degree. She has student loans totaling about $74,000, on which deferment ended in \nDecember 2018. (Tr. 69.) The student loans are not alleged in the SOR. \n \n \nApplicant married in July 2011. (GX 1 at 6.) Around December 2011, her husband \nleft her. She filed for divorce in 2012, and the divorce was final in May 2014. She has an \n11-year-old daughter from her previous marriage, for whom she receives child-support \npayments of $800 per month. She also has a 15-year-old son from a previous relationship, \nfor whom she receives child support of $147 per month. She remarried in 2017 and has \na 19-month-old daughter from this marriage. (GX 2 at 2-3; Tr. 30-31.) \n \n \nApplicant has worked for federal contractors since at least February 2002 as a \nreceptionist, technical assistant, executive assistant, administrative specialist, human-\nresources specialist, performance-management analyst, and payroll time-and- \nattendance specialist. She was unemployed from June to November 2011, when her \nemployer\u2019s contract ended. Her previous jobs did not offer medical insurance, and she \nincurred debts for medical care. She had a full-time day job and worked at full-time night \njobs at fast-food restaurants during the summer of 2012. She worked part time at a fast-\nfood restaurant for three months in 2012 or 2013. (GX 2 at 2.) In each case, she quit her \nnight job because she was physically unable to work two jobs. \n \n \nApplicant purchased a home in 2005 with an adjustable-rate mortgage. Her \nhusband\u2019s pay was reduced when he was moved from a supervisory position to a lower-\n                                                          \n2 Applicant\u2019s personal information is extracted from her application for a public trust position (GX 1) unless \notherwise indicated by a parenthetical citation to the record. \n\n3 \n \npaying non-supervisory position. (Tr. 46.) They filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy in \nSeptember 2007 because they could not afford to pay the mortgage loan and could not \nobtain a loan modification. The bankruptcy also included her then husband\u2019s car loan, \nmedical bills, and her then husband\u2019s credit-card debt. They received a discharge in June \n2009. About $259,000-$280,000 was discharged. (GX 2 at 5; Tr. 32.) \n \n \nAfter Applicant\u2019s first husband left her, she remained in the marital home, which \nshe had purchased in July 2010. Her mother, who has since passed away, also was living \nwith and supported by her. Applicant stayed in the marital home for about two months, \nmoved in with a friend, and then sold the marital home in a short sale. The credit report \nfrom April 2017 reflects that the mortgage loan was paid. (GX 4 at 1.) Her friend was \nretired military and employed full time. They agreed to split their living expenses, but \nApplicant found herself paying most of the expenses. She could not afford to move out, \nand so she continued to live with her friend for about two years. (Tr. 37-39.)  \n \nAround 2015, Applicant began living with a co-worker, and they married in 2017. \n(Tr. 30.) Her current husband is retired military and she is entitled to military medical \nbenefits as a military family member. Her current husband has given her financial \nguidance and has joined her in managing the family finances. (Tr. 40-41.) She testified \nthat her husband has prepared a spreadsheet for her, setting out a plan to resolve her \ndelinquent debts. It lists specific creditors and specific payment amounts to each creditor. \nShe did not submit the spreadsheet at the hearing. She promised to submit a copy of it, \nbut it was not included in her post-hearing submission. (Tr. 75-76.)  \n \n \nThe SOR alleges the Chapter 7 bankruptcy (SOR \u00b6 1.a), a delinquent car loan \n(SOR \u00b6 1.b), and five medical debts (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c-1.g). The bankruptcy and delinquent \ndebts are reflected in credit reports from November 2018 (GX 3), April 2017 (GX 4), and \nOctober 2014 (GX 5.)  \n \nThe allegations of delinquent medical debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d-1.g do not comply with \nthe requirement for specificity in Directive \u00b6 E3.1.3, which requires that the SOR \u201cshall be \nas detailed and comprehensive as the national security permits.\u201d The SOR does not \nidentify the creditors or collection agents and provides no account numbers. The April \n2017 credit report on which they are based lists only the date each account was opened. \nHowever, Applicant was able to track down each of these medical debts. The evidence \nconcerning the delinquent debts is summarized below. \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.b: delinquent car loan charged off for $10,375. Applicant testified that \nthis debt was jointly incurred during her previous marriage. (Tr. 47.) The account was \nopened in December 2011, and the debt was charged off in June 2014. (GX 3 at 5; GX 5 \nat 3.) In a personal subject interview (PSI) in November 2014, Applicant told an \ninvestigator that she was negotiating with this creditor. She admitted this debt in her \nanswer to the SOR and stated that she would resolve it after she resolved other smaller \ndebts. At the hearing, she testified that she contacted the creditor and was offered a \nsettlement for $8,000, but she could not afford to accept it. (Tr. 47-48.) She did not provide \nany documentary evidence of the settlement offer. In her post-hearing submission, she \nasserted that this creditor informed her that it would not attempt to collect this debt \n\n4 \n \nbecause it is barred by the statute of limitations. (AX D.) She provided no documentary \nevidence to support her assertion regarding the statute of limitations.  \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.c: medical debt for eye surgery, past due for $172. This debt was \nincurred in December 2014, and the last payment was in March 2015. (GX 3 at 6; GX 4 \nat 2.) The total amount due on this debt is $2,826. (GX 4 at 2.) Applicant underwent laser \nsurgery after her vision declined and she began wearing glasses. She decided that the \nsurgery made more financial sense than paying for new glasses whenever her vision \nchanged. (Tr. 51.) Applicant has promised to make biweekly $75 payments beginning on \nJanuary 19, 2019. (AX I.) As of the date the record closed, she had not made any \npayments.  \n \n \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d: medical debt for $651. This debt was incurred when Applicant went \nto an emergency room after an automobile accident in 2013. She testified that she \ndisputed the amount of the debt because she left the emergency room for an unspecified \npersonal emergency before being treated. She settled the debt for a lesser amount on \nNovember 30, 2018, after she received the SOR. (AX A; Tr. 53-54.) \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.e: medical debt for $331. This debt was paid in full on September 28, \n2017, after Applicant received the SOR. (AX H.) \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.f: medical debt for $156. This debt was paid in full in March 2016. (AX \nG.) \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.g: medical debt for $47. This debt was paid in full on January 9, 2017. \n(AX F.) \n \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s annual pay is about $96,000, which is a substantial increase from her \nprevious job, which paid $65,000 per year. Her take-home pay ranges from about $2,000 \nto $2,300. She has no savings. (Tr. 80.) Her husband is retired military, and his annual \npay is about $104,000. (Tr. 80.) Applicant does not know how much he receives in military \nretired pay. Her husband has four children from his previous marriage and pays child \nsupport for two of them. He also is still jointly liable for the mortgage payments on his \nprevious marital home. (Tr. 88.) Applicant\u2019s rent is $2,700. She pays $1,700, and her \nhusband pays $1,000, plus the utilities. They have a monthly car payment of $554. (Tr. \n67.) She did not provide any other information about her monthly living expenses. \n \n \nApplicant testified that she did not contact the various creditors alleged in the SOR \nuntil recently, because she did not have sufficient income to make payments, and she did \nnot want to make a payment agreement that she would be unable to afford. (Tr. 86.) Her \ncurrent employment contract is for three years, and she is confident that her income will \nnot decrease during the duration of the contract and may increase. (Tr. 83.) \n \nPolicies \n \nADP positions are sensitive positions, and applicants for ADP positions are entitled \nto the procedural protections in the Directive before any final unfavorable access \n\n5 \n \ndetermination may be made. The standard for assignment to sensitive duties is that the \nperson\u2019s loyalty, reliability, and trustworthiness are such that assigning the person to \nsensitive duties is clearly consistent with the interests of national security.   \n \nA person who seeks access to sensitive information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, \nby necessity, consideration of the possible risk the applicant may deliberately or \ninadvertently fail to safeguard sensitive information.  \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a public trust position, the \nadministrative judge must consider the disqualifying and mitigating conditions in the AG. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of \nhuman behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the \nwhole person. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial \nand commonsense decision. An administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable.  \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. Under AG \n\u00b6 2(b), \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to [sensitive] \ninformation will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d The Government must present \nsubstantial evidence to establish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 \nE3.1.14. Once the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, \nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-\n31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). An applicant has the ultimate burden of \ndemonstrating that it is clearly consistent with national security to grant or continue \neligibility for access to sensitive information.  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18:  \n \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. . . . An individual who is financially \noverextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or otherwise \nquestionable acts to generate funds. . . .  \n \n \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified or sensitive information to raise money. It encompasses concerns \nabout a person\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting \n\n6 \n \nclassified or sensitive information. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be \nirresponsible, unconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified or \nsensitive information. See ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s admissions and the documentary evidence submitted at the hearing \nestablish the following disqualifying conditions under this guideline: AG \u00b6 19(a) (\u201cinability \nto satisfy debts\u201d); AG \u00b6 19(b) (\u201cunwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to \ndo so\u201d); and AG \u00b6 19(c) (\u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations\u201d). \n \n \nThe following mitigating conditions are potentially relevant: \n \nAG \u00b6 20(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not \ncast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \nAG \u00b6 20(b): the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \nAG \u00b6 20(c): the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling \nfor the problem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit \ncredit counseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem \nis being resolved or is under control; and \n \nAG \u00b6 20(d): the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to \nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(a) is not fully established. Applicant\u2019s delinquent debts are numerous and \nrecent, and the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b and 1.c were not incurred under \ncircumstances making them unlikely to recur. The medical debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d-\n1.g are less likely to recur, because Applicant\u2019s recent marriage entitles her to military \nmedical benefits. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(b) is established for Applicant\u2019s Chapter 7 bankruptcy. It was caused by \nher then husband\u2019s pay reduction and upward adjustment in her mortgage-loan \npayments, which were conditions largely beyond her control. Under the circumstances, \nfiling a Chapter 7 bankruptcy petition was a prudent decision.  \n \nAG \u00b6 20(b) is not established for the debts incurred after Applicant\u2019s bankruptcy. \nHer marital breakup and the resulting income reduction, unemployment from June to \nNovember 2011, unemployment from April to November 2018, and uninsured medical \ndebts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d-1.g were conditions largely beyond her control. However, \nher medical debt for laser surgery alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.c was voluntarily incurred. The \n\n7 \n \nrecord does not reflect why her employment was terminated in April 2018, but there is no \nevidence that it was voluntary or due to any misconduct.  \n \nHowever, Applicant has not acted responsibly regarding the debts alleged in SOR \n\u00b6\u00b6 1.b, 1.d, and 1.e. The car loan in SOR \u00b6 1.b was incurred in December 2011, while \nshe was employed, and she acted responsibly for a while by working second jobs in 2012 \nand 2013. However, she stopped making payments in June or July 2014, well before she \nlost her job in April 2018. She has provided no documentary evidence of any efforts to \nresolve the debt, except for her reliance on a statute of limitations. She provided no \nevidence of efforts to resolve the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.c until after the hearing, and she has \nmade no payments on the debt. She did not resolve the medical debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 \n1.d and 1.e until after she received the SOR.  \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(c) is not established. Other than the financial counseling required by the \nbankruptcy court in 2008, she presented no evidence of financial counseling, and her \nfinancial situation is not under control. \n \nAG \u00b6 20(d) is established for the medical debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.f and 1.g, \nwhich Applicant resolved before she received the SOR. She claimed that the creditor \nalleged in SOR \u00b6 1.b told her that it would not attempt to collect the debt because it was \nbarred by the statute of limitations, but she submitted no evidence to support her claim. \nFurthermore, reliance on the non-collectability because of a statute of limitations does not \nconstitute a good-faith effort to resolve that debt. ISCR Case No. 11-08274 (App. Bd. May \n2, 2013).  \n \nApplicant submitted a specific plan to resolve the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.c, but she \nsubmitted no evidence that the creditor had agreed to the plan and no evidence of any \npayments under the plan. Her resolution of the medical debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d and \n1.e after she received the SOR does not amount to a good-faith effort. Evidence of past \nirresponsibility is not mitigated by payment of debts only under pressure of qualifying for \na public trust position. An applicant who does not resolve debts until an application for a \npublic trust position is in jeopardy may lack the good judgment expected of those with \naccess to sensitive information. See ISCR Case No. 16-01211 (App. Bd. May 30, 2018) \nciting ISCR Case No. 15-03208 at 5 (App. Bd. Mar. 7, 2017).  \n \nApplicant has made some progress in attaining financial stability, tracking down \nand resolving several medical debts. However, she has not established a track record of \nfinancial responsibility. She testified that she had a plan to resolve all her debts and that \nthe plan was laid out in a detailed spreadsheet, but she did not submit it at the hearing or \nin her post-hearing submission.  \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(e) is not established. Applicant claimed that she disputed the amount of \nthe medical debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.d, but she provided no documentation to support her \nclaim. However, she eventually settled the debt. She has not disputed any of the other \ndebts alleged in the SOR.  \n \n \n \n\n8 \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \npublic trust position must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-\nperson concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a public \ntrust position by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances and applying the adjudicative factors in AG \u00b6 2(d).3  \n \n \nI have incorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis \nand applied the adjudicative factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). After weighing the disqualifying and \nmitigating conditions under Guideline F, and evaluating all the evidence in the context of \nthe whole person, I conclude Applicant has not mitigated the trustworthiness concerns \nraised by her delinquent debts. Accordingly, I conclude she has not carried her burden of \nshowing that it is clearly consistent with national security to grant her eligibility for a public \ntrust position. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F (Financial Considerations): AGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.b-1.e: \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.f and 1.g: \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the interests of national security to \ngrant Applicant eligibility for a public trust position. Eligibility for a public trust position is \ndenied. \n \n \n \n \nLeRoy F.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant admitted the SOR allegations. He is a 58-year-old industrial security specialist employed by a U.S. defense contractor since June 2016. He has been employed in related positions since February 1999, with periods of unemployment from January-June 2011 and January-June 2016. He has previously had favorable background investigations in June 2002 and July 2009. This is a periodic reinvestigation of that clearance (GE 1). The SOR alleges, Government exhibits substantiate, and Applicant admits six delinquent debts totaling over $122,000. The debts comprise a $20,619 Internal Revenue Service (IRS) tax lien filed in May 2010, and five delinquent education loans 3 totaling $101,629. Applicant obtained the education loans to pay for his children\u2019s college expenses. Applicant disclosed the fact, but not the amount, of the tax lien on his August 2014 clearance application (GE 1). He did not disclose any delinquent education loans on his clearance application, but discussed them with a Government investigator during a February 2015 interview (GE 2) based on an August 2014 credit report (GE 4). Applicant\u2019s July 2016 credit report (GE 3) reflects the education loan amounts alleged in the SOR.

Applicant timely answered the SOR, requesting a hearing before the\n2\nDefense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA). DOHA assigned the case to me 20\nJuly 2017 and I convened a hearing 30 August 2017. DOHA received the transcript 7\nSeptember 2017, and the record closed.\nConsisting of the transcript (Tr.), Government exhibits (GE) 1-4, and hearing exhibit (HE) I.\n1\nDoD acted under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information Within Industry (February 20,\n2\n1960), as amended; DoD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program\n(January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) effective within the DoD on\n1 September 2006. However, on 10 December 2016, the Director of National Intelligence (DNI) signed\nSecurity Executive Agent Directive 4, implementing new AG, effective with any decision issued on or after 8\nJune 2017. My decision is the same under both guidelines.\n1\n   12/17/2018\n\nFindings of Fact\nApplicant admitted the SOR allegations. He is a 58-year-old industrial security\nspecialist employed by a U.S. defense contractor since June 2016. He has been\nemployed in related positions since February 1999, with periods of unemployment from\nJanuary-June 2011 and January-June 2016. He has previously had favorable\nbackground investigations in June 2002 and July 2009. This is a periodic reinvestigation\nof that clearance (GE 1).\nThe SOR alleges, Government exhibits substantiate, and Applicant admits six\ndelinquent debts totaling over $122,000. The debts comprise a $20,619 Internal\nRevenue Service (IRS) tax lien filed in May 2010,  and five delinquent education loans\n3\ntotaling $101,629. Applicant obtained the education loans to pay for his children\u2019s\ncollege expenses. Applicant disclosed the fact, but not the amount, of the tax lien on his\nAugust 2014 clearance application (GE 1). He did not disclose any delinquent education\nloans on his clearance application, but discussed them with a Government investigator\nduring a February 2015 interview (GE 2) based on an August 2014 credit report (GE 4).\nApplicant\u2019s July 2016 credit report (GE 3) reflects the education loan amounts alleged in\nthe SOR. Applicant\u2019s January 2017 Answer contains a December 2016 loan account\nstatement showing a $103,546 combined principal balance.  \n4\nApplicant attributed his financial problems to being laid off in January 2011. At\nthe time, he was making $145,000-150,000 annually, and was generally not having any\nproblems keeping up with his financial obligations. He received an unstated amount of\nseverance pay (GE 2). He was unemployed until June 2016, when he obtained\nemployment paying $125,000 annually. In January 2012, he obtained a different job,\nearning $128,000 annually. In January 2016, he resigned that position, and remained\nunemployed until June 2016, when he obtained his current position, earning $124,000\nannually (Tr. 41).\nApplicant did not explain why he had Federal income tax liens filed against him in\n2010, only that his January 2011 layoff made it difficult for him to keep up his payment\nplan, which he otherwise did not document. Similarly, during his February 2015\ninterview, he claimed to have just arranged a repayment plan on his education loans, to\npay $120 monthly. He could not recall the start or payoff dates for his repayment plan\n(GE 2). At hearing, he claimed, without corroboration to be paying $1,000 monthly\nthrough direct withdrawal for about the last six months (Tr. 35-36).\nApplicant had two other tax liens filed in 2010, which were satisfied (GE 4). Also not alleged in the SOR,\n3\nApplicant had state tax garnishments issued against him in March and July 2013, which were satisfied. He\nhad a June 2014 garnishment order for $91,464.12 in delinquent education loans. In June 2014, he had a\n$27,826 IRS levy for tax years 2005-2007 (GE 2). Applicant provided no independent documentation of his\ncurrent tax status.\nThe account statement showed no past-due amounts. The $1,100 January monthly payment included unpaid\n4\nfees, not otherwise specified. \n2\n\nApplicant documented no credit or financial counseling, and did not submit a\nbudget. He provided no work or character references, or evidence of community\ninvolvement.\nPolicies\nThe adjudicative guidelines (AG) list factors for evaluating a person\u2019s suitability\nfor access to classified information. Administrative judges must assess disqualifying and\nmitigating conditions under each issue fairly raised by the facts and situation presented.\nEach decision must also reflect a fair, impartial, and commonsense consideration of the\nfactors listed in AG \u00b6 2(a). Any one disqualifying or mitigating condition is not, by itself,\nconclusive. However, specific adjudicative guidelines should be followed where a case\ncan be measured against them, as they represent policy guidance governing access to\nclassified information. Considering the SOR allegations and the evidence as a whole,\nthe relevant adjudicative guideline is Guideline F (Financial Considerations).\nSecurity clearance decisions resolve whether it is clearly consistent with the\nnational interest to grant or continue an applicant\u2019s security clearance. The Government\nmust prove, by substantial evidence, controverted facts alleged in the SOR. If it does, \nthe burden shifts to applicant to refute, extenuate, or mitigate the Government\u2019s case.\nBecause no one has a right to a security clearance, the applicant bears a heavy burden\nof persuasion.\nPersons with access to classified information enter into a fiduciary relationship\nwith the Government based on trust and confidence. Therefore, the Government has a\ncompelling interest in ensuring each applicant possesses the requisite judgement,\nreliability, and trustworthiness of those who must protect national interests as their own.\nThe \u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d standard compels resolution of any\nreasonable doubt about an applicant\u2019s suitability for access in favor of the Government.5\nAnalysis\nThe Government established a case for disqualification under Guideline F, and\nApplicant failed to fully mitigate the security concerns. Applicant\u2019s unresolved May 2010\nIRS tax lien highlights ongoing tax issues which Applicant has neither explained nor\ndocumented any resolution of. These issues appear to predate his January 2011 layoff,\nand the subsequent decline in income explains only the difficulty meeting any\nrepayment obligations undertaken, not the need for a repayment plan. Similarly, the\ndecline in income explains why the education loans fell delinquent, but does not\nSee, Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518 (1988).\n5\n3\n\ndocument any repayment efforts undertaken upon regaining employment, albeit at\nreduced salary.6\nApplicant \nonly \npartially \nmeets \nthe \nmitigating \nconditions \nfor \nfinancial\nconsiderations. The precipitating layoff occurred over six years ago, not recent, and the\ncircumstances are not likely to recur.  However, while the circumstances of that layoff\n7\nwere beyond his control,  he has not documented that he behaved responsibly under\n8\nthe circumstances. As early as February 2015, Applicant claimed to have taken steps to\nresolve his IRS and education loan issues, but aside from a single data point in\nDecember 2016, he has not documented the claimed regular payments on his\neducation loans or documented any actions taken regarding the IRS lien.9\n \nApplicant has neither claimed nor documented any credit or financial counseling,\nand there is a dearth of evidence to show that his financial problems have been\nresolved or are under control.  This failure of evidence precludes a conclusion that\n10\nApplicant has made a good-faith effort to address his debts.  Moreover, he submitted\n11\nno work or character evidence which might support a whole-person assessment to\novercome the security concerns raised by his conduct. I conclude Guideline F against\nApplicant.\n Formal Findings\nParagraph 1. Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs a-f:\nAgainst Applicant\n\u00b619(a) inability to satisfy debts; (b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so; (c) a history\n6\nof not meeting financial obligations; (e) consistent spending beyond one\u2019s means or frivolous or irresponsible\nspending . . . ;\n\u00b620(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such circumstances that\n7\nit is  unlikely to recur . . . \nBut not so his January 2016 resignation from his job, the financial impact of which Applicant did not\n8\ndocument.\n\u00b620(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s control . . . and\n9\nthe individual acted responsibly under the circumstances;\n\u00b620(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem . . .  and there are clear indications\n10\nthat the problem is being resolved or is under control;\n\u00b620(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise\n11\nresolve debts.\n4\n\nConclusion\nUnder the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for\nApplicant. Clearance denied.  \n                                              \n                                             \nJOHN GRATTAN METZ, JR\nAdministrative Judge\n5\n",

He joined the Navy Reserve in February 2010, and in October 2012, he resigned his commission due to a pending Federal investigation. While serving as a government contracting officer in Iraq, Applicant had been accused of setting up a sham company, bribery, and receiving monetary kickbacks for awarding contacts to companies involved in the scheme.

National security eligibility for access to classified information is denied.  \n Statement of the Case \nOn August 26, 2014, and August 3, 2017, Applicant submitted security clearance \napplications (SCA). On March 6, 2018, the Department of Defense Consolidated \nAdjudications Facility (DOD CAF) issued Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR), \ndetailing security concerns under Guideline E (Personal Conduct). The action was taken \nunder Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry \n(February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel \nSecurity Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and \nthe Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) effective within the DOD on June 8, 2017.    \nApplicant answered the SOR on April 23, 2018, and he provided four documents \nwith his response. He admitted SOR allegations \u00b6\u00b6 1.b - 1.f, and denied \u00b6 1.a.   \nApplicant obtained counsel and requested a hearing before an administrative judge. \nDepartment Counsel provided discovery and an amendment to the SOR to Applicant\u2019s \n\n \n2 \n \n \nCounsel by letter dated November 5, 2018. The amendment included SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.g - 1.n; \nall falsification allegations cited under Guideline E. On November 30, 2018, Applicant \ndenied SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.g - 1.n. On December 31, 2018, the Defense Office of Hearings and \nAppeals (DOHA) issued a notice of hearing, setting the hearing for January 17, 2019. \nOn January 4, 2019, the case was assigned to me. \n \n \nDuring the hearing, Department Counsel offered Government Exhibit (GE) 1-14, \nbut only GE 1-10 were admitted into evidence without objection. Applicant\u2019s Counsel \nobjected to GE 11-14, as noted under Procedural Matters addressed below. In addition, \nCounsel offered Applicant Exhibit (AE) B, C, E, F, G, and L,1 which I admitted into \nevidence without objection. (Tr. 26-32) Applicant called his wife to testify on his behalf. I \nheld the record open until February 17, 2019, in the event either party wanted to submit \nadditional documentation. On January 22, 2019, Applicant\u2019s counsel provided two \nadditional documents. I admitted AE M and N into evidence without objection. DOHA \nreceived the hearing transcript (Tr.) on January 28, 2019, and the record was closed on \nFebruary 17, 2019. \n \n \n \n \n \n \nProcedural Matters \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s Counsel objected to GE 11-14, which are reports of Applicant\u2019s \nbackground interviews during various security clearance investigations. Applicant\u2019s \nCounsel believed the reports of subject interview were incomplete reports, and claimed \nthe falsification allegations were taken out of context. Department Counsel stated that \nthe subject interview reports were complete summary reports, but Applicant\u2019s Counsel\u2019s \nclaim of \u201cstatements taken out of context\u201d was due to him not receiving Applicant\u2019s \nentire report of investigation. (ROI) She correctly noted that DOHA is not authorized to \nprovide the entire ROI since it is the property of Office of Personnel Management \n(OPM). I reviewed GE 11-14, and I determined that the summary of Applicant\u2019s \ninterview was complete in all four documents. The summary covered the beginning, \nmiddle, and the end of Applicant\u2019s interview, without any missing pages. Of course, the \ninterviews are summaries and are not verbatim. They do not provide complete \ninformation from the interviews. I also advised Applicant\u2019s Counsel to clearly state \nduring Applicant\u2019s testimony if there were any discrepancies in the summary of the \nbackground interviews, which I would take into consideration. (Tr. 20-25) \n \n \nThe subject interview summary is an investigative report produced by OPM, a \nFederal government agency. OPM is required to complete subject interviews in the \nDOD security clearance investigations. Applicant\u2019s admissions are of a party opponent \nand according to Federal Rule of Evidence (Fed. R. Evid.) 801(d)(2), they are not \nhearsay. In the alternative, the summary is admissible as a record of a regularly \nrecurring activity\u2013in this case a security clearance investigation under Fed. R. Evid. \n803(6). ISCR Case No. 16-02536 at 3 (App. Bd. Mar. 11, 2019). [Except OPM \ninvestigative records. See n. 3.] Thus, I overruled Counsel\u2019s objection to the four subject \n                                                          \n1 Some tabs from Applicant\u2019s notebook of exhibits were removed prior to the hearing. The notebook \ncontained a table of contents, but not all of the tabs listed in the table of contents were included in the \nnotebook that was provided to me at the hearing. \n\n \n3 \n \n \ninterview summaries of Applicant. I admitted GE 11-14 into evidence, and I have \naccorded the facts therein the appropriate weight given the record as a whole.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nHaving thoroughly considered the evidence in the record, I make the following \nfindings of fact:  Applicant is 38 years old. He earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in 2005, and \na master\u2019s degree in 2007. Applicant was married in 2003 and divorced in 2009. He \nremarried in 2009. He has a daughter, age 12, and an adult stepdaughter, age 21. \nApplicant enlisted in the U.S. Air Force in March 2003. He was on active duty until \nDecember 2005, when he received an honorable discharge due to hardship. He joined \nthe Navy Reserve in February 2010, and in October 2012, he resigned his commission \ndue to a pending Federal investigation. While serving as a government contracting \nofficer in Iraq, Applicant had been accused of setting up a sham company, bribery, and \nreceiving monetary kickbacks for awarding contacts to companies involved in the \nscheme. He could not be promoted in the Navy Reserves while a Federal investigation \nwas on-going, and he received an honorable discharge. (Tr. 12-14, 33, 38, 42, 46-48, \n77-78, 119, 121-122; GE 1, GE 3-6; AE M, AE N) \n \nSince 2012, Applicant is the chief executive officer and 51% service disabled \nveteran owner of a federal consulting company that has 150 employees and does $10 \nmillion in business annually. He manages many different operations in the company. \nApplicant does not currently possess a DOD security clearance, but he previously held \na DOD security clearance and a DOD facility clearance until 2015. Applicant is \nrequesting that he be granted a personal DOD security clearance, and as Key \nManagement Personnel, his company could then be granted a DOD facility clearance. \n(Tr. 12-14, 33, 38, 46-49, 77-78; GE 1) \n \nSOR allegation \u00b6 1.a alleges that in 2009, while Applicant was working as a U.S. \nGovernment Contracting Officer in Iraq, he was investigated for bribery and conspiracy \nto commit bribery. In his response to the SOR, Applicant denied this allegation, and also \nnoted that this adverse information occurred a decade ago. On May 18, 2015, Applicant \nreceived notice via certified mail from the U.S. Army Procurement Fraud Division that \nafter completion of a Federal investigation, Applicant and his company were being \nconsidered for debarment from future contracting with any agency in the Executive \nbranch of the U.S. Government. (AE M) He denied receiving any notice from the \nGovernment. He found out about the proposed debarment from his business partner, \nwho had checked the website listing debarred federal contractors and individuals. (Tr. \n97-98) Applicant obtained counsel, disputed the findings of the investigation, and \nargued that debarment was not appropriate in this matter. (AE N) On February 25, \n2016, the U.S. Army Procurement Fraud Division agreed to establish an administrative \ncompliance agreement, and required Applicant to take a business ethics course. (SOR \nresponse attachment 2)  A Memorandum from the U.S. Department of Justice, Federal \nBureau of Investigation (FBI), dated August 6, 2012, stated that although there was not \nenough corroboration obtained during the investigation to charge Applicant with bribery, \nand attempted bribery, the case agents from FBI, Defense Criminal Investigative \n\n \n4 \n \n \nServices, Army Criminal Investigation Command, and Special Inspector General for Iraq \nReconstruction believe that Applicant was involved in criminal activity. (Tr. 95-102; GE \n3-7; AE C, AE M, AE N)  \n \nSOR allegation \u00b6 1.b alleges that in 2011, while Applicant was employed as an \nemployee of the United States Peace Corps, he accessed pornographic websites on his \nassigned government computer. Applicant admitted this allegation in his response to the \nSOR. He stated that he had just filed a complaint with the Office of Inspector General \n(OIG) against his supervisor for selling illegal drugs to Peace Corps employees, \nnepotism, and possible contract fraud. She also discriminated against military members. \nApplicant testified that his supervisor asked him directly if he wanted to be part of a \ncontract bribery scam. After hearing her offer, Applicant admitted to being \nunprofessional, and he said some curse words to his supervisor. He claimed his \nsupervisor then placed him on a performance improvement plan. (PIP) About three \nweeks after he filed an OIG complaint against his supervisor, a computer check \nrevealed that Applicant had been visiting pornography websites on his work computer. \nThere were also allegations of him reporting to work late and leaving work early. \nApplicant was called into an office with an OIG representative, and he signed the \npaperwork that was provided to him. He said the paper included an admission of guilt, \nwhich he agreed to sign since he was guilty of accessing pornographic websites on his \nwork computer. Applicant noted that he signed the paperwork without the benefit of \nhaving legal representation. (Tr. 60-70)  \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.g alleges Applicant intentionally failed to disclose his employment with \nthe U.S. Peace Corps when he completed his 2014 SCA. Applicant denied this \nallegation, and believes the omission was either a computer glitch, the result of a \u201cgag \norder\u201d he thought was in effect, or just oversite. SOR \u00b6 1.m alleges that during his \nbackground interview in September 2014, Applicant volunteered information about his \nemployment with the U.S. Peace Corps. When initially asked by the investigator \nwhether he had any difficulties with this employment, Applicant denied any difficulties, \nand said no one from the Peace Corps would question his conduct or behavior at this \nemployment. He did not violate any oral, written or otherwise recorded agreements \nmade with this employer. He admitted to the investigator that he clicked on links \nprovided by his father which, unbeknownst to him, turned out to be pornographic \nwebsites. At the hearing, Applicant accepted full responsibility for intentionally visiting \npornographic websites on his government computer. He did not disclose on his SCA \nthat he was terminated for accessing pornography on his government computer. (Tr. 70-\n73, 102-103, 107-108, 124-127; 136-137, 139; GE 2, GE 11; AE L) \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.n alleges that Applicant intentionally lied to the investigator during his \nbackground interview in September 2014 when he told the investigator that he had been \nemployed by the Peace Corps, but he was under a gag order and could no longer \ndiscuss his employment with the Peace Corps during his interview. Applicant stated that \nhe believed the gag order was valid, and he was required to keep his \u201cmouth shut.\u201d (Tr. \n70-73, 102-103,109,136; GE 2, GE 11; AE L)  \n \n\n \n5 \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.j alleges that Applicant falsified his 2017 SCA when he answered \u201cno\u201d \nto the question if within the last seven years, had he ever received a written warning, \nbeen officially reprimanded, suspended, or disciplined for misconduct in the workplace. \nApplicant denied this allegation. He believed he was under a \u201cgag order\u201d and could not \ndisclose any information about his misconduct while employed by the U.S. Peace \nCorps. He claimed paragraph 3, of an unsigned settlement agreement, (AE L) was the \ndriving force in this matter. Applicant said he also knew this adverse information was \nreadily available during his investigation, so he was not attempting to hide this \ninformation. Later during the hearing, Applicant stated that he did not know the exact \ntime period, and going back 7 years, he should have listed his misconduct for viewing \npornography while employed by the Peace Corps, but he mistakenly missed the seven-\nyear cut-off by \u201cdays.\u201d Applicant did not list his termination from the Peace Corps for \nviewing pornography on the SCA. He stated he was not trying to hide the information. \nAfter reading Paragraph 3 of AE L, I find that it does not contain any language which \nwould prevent Applicant from discussing his Peace Corps employment misconduct \nduring the course of his background investigation. (Tr. 60-73, 104, 129, 140-14; GE 1, \nGE 2; AE L, paragraph 3)   \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.k alleges Applicant falsified material facts during a December 2011 \nsubject interview when he told the investigator that he was under a gag order as a result \nof a lawsuit he filed against the Peace Corps. He had filed a complaint against the \nPeace Corps and the matter was settled out of court. He could not provide additional \ninformation, due to a gag order issued by the presiding judge. (GE 14) In addition, \nApplicant deliberately withheld the circumstances that led to him being placed on paid \nadministrative leave, due to viewing pornographic websites on his government \ncomputer. Applicant testified that he has always admitted his misconduct of viewing \npornography whenever questioned, and also admitted he lost his employment position \ndue to viewing pornography. Later in the hearing, Applicant said he was not forthcoming \nwith his pornography misconduct due to the gag order, and he recommended the \ninvestigator obtain his employment history directly from the Peace Corps. (Tr. 73-75, \n105, 113) \n \nSOR allegation \u00b6 1.l alleges that Applicant gave conflicting accounts during his \nbackground interviews concerning the circumstances of viewing pornography on his \nwork computer. During his March 2012 interview, Applicant told the investigator that he \nhad looked at pornographic sites on his Government computer when he was on his \npersonal e-mail account. The websites were sent to him by his military friends. He did \nnot consider viewing pornographic websites from his personal e-mail a problem or in \nviolation of any policy. During his September 2014 background interview, Applicant said \nhe clicked on links provided by his father, which he did not know contained \npornographic as well as shopping websites. (Tr. 106-107; GE 11, GE 13) \n \nSOR allegation \u00b6 1.c alleges that Applicant was counseled while employed with \nU.S. General Services Administration (GSA) for misuse of his Government credit card. \nIn 2012, his employment with GSA was terminated. Applicant admitted this allegation in \nresponse to the SOR. He denied that the misuse of his Government credit card was \n\n \n6 \n \n \nintentional. His wife inadvertently pulled this credit card out of a stack of personal credit \ncards Applicant kept at home. When GSA notified him of the fraudulent activity, he \nimmediately paid the balance billed to his Government credit card. He claimed to have \nself-reported the misuse of his Government credit card to his supervisor. His supervisor \ntold Applicant that this incident was a minor issue. Applicant was later called into an \noffice with his supervisor and the chief of staff, approximately six weeks before the \nexpiration of his employment probationary period. They asked him to commit contract \nfraud, which he immediately refused. The chief of staff slipped a piece of paper to him, \nand he discovered that he was being placed on a PIP for insubordination, and misuse of \na Government credit card. Applicant stated he turned over the PIP document and wrote \nthat he immediately resigned his position with GSA. Before he walked out of the room, \nhe was told that he could not resign from a government job. It was his understanding \nthat he resigned from GSA. Upon further question at the hearing, Applicant was asked \nwhy he had denied being fired from GSA, as he indicated that he thought he was simply \nlet go during his probationary period. Applicant said this statement was correct, as he \nwas unsure of his status when he left employment with GSA. (Tr. 76-77, 83-93, 146; AE \nE) \n \nSOR allegation \u00b6 1.h alleges that Applicant falsified his 2014 SCA when he listed \nthat he left employment with GSA to start his own business. SOR \u00b6 1.i alleges Applicant \nfalsified information on the same SCA when he denied he was fired, quit after being told \nhe would be fired, or left employment by mutual agreement for misconduct or \nunsatisfactory performance. (GE 2) Applicant denied these allegations. He did start his \ncompany after leaving GSA, and he had resigned from his position. (Tr. 93-95, 103-104, \n127-128) \n \nDuring the hearing, his attorney asked Applicant:  \n \nCounsel: \u201cAnd it was your understanding that you resigned and they \n(GSA) said no, you can\u2019t resign.\u201d \n \nApplicant: \u201cThat is correct.\u201d \n \nCounsel: \u201cAnd they fired you.\u201d \n \nApplicant: \u201cThat is correct.\u201d \n \nCounsel: \u201cBut you weren\u2019t aware of that?\u201d \n \nApplicant: \u201cNo I wasn\u2019t. Once again I didn\u2019t hire legal counsel. Once \nagain [I] walked out of the building the same day.\u201d (Tr. 93) \n \n\u2026and later during the hearing:  \n \nCounsel: \u201cAnd it says when in fact you were terminated from that \n(GSA) position. Did you understand you were terminated?\u201d \n\n \n7 \n \n \n \nApplicant: \u201cNo, not at that time I did not know I was terminated.\u201d (Tr. \n103) \n \nOn the 2017 SCA completed by Applicant, he listed his reason for leaving \nGSA as follows: \n \nI was terminated for insubordination. I was asked by my entire team \nof executives to illegally award several contracts, valued in the $100s \nof millions of dollars, to companies of their choosing. I told them that \nit was illegal, and that I respectfully refused. When I did that, I was \nstill under my \u20181 year probationary\u2019 period, and was terminated from \nmy employment.\u201d (GE 1 pg. 14) [ \n \nOn page 15 of his 2017 SCA, Applicant said, \u201c\u2026When I refused, respectfully, I was \nissued termination papers, and left the same day. If I had to do it again, I would do \nit EXACTLY the same way. No questions.\u201d \n \nDuring the hearing Applicant was questioned about his contradictory statements. \nHe stated that he learned much later that he had been terminated by GSA in 2012. \nWhen he filled out the SCA in 2014, he reflected that termination information he just \nonly recently discovered. When asked how he found out about his termination from \nGSA, he said, \u201cI don\u2019t remember. There\u2019s somehow I did find out. I don\u2019t remember. I \ndon\u2019t recall.\u201d (Tr. 147-149) \n \nSOR allegation \u00b6 1.d alleges that Applicant was arrested in May 2012 for assault \nof a family member (wife). Applicant testified that during this time he was having \ndifficulty with his wife. He claimed she was addicted to illegal drugs. He admitted during \nthe hearing to being arrested in state A for having an open container in public, but he \ndenied ever being arrested in May 2012 or convicted of domestic assault. (Tr. 49-52) \nDuring Applicant\u2019s background interview in January 2013, he told the investigator that \nhis neighbors called the police whenever he and his wife got into a loud argument. The \npolice were called three times to their apartment, and his wife was arrested on all three \noccasions. Applicant stated he was never arrested or charged with domestic \ndisturbance on any of those occasions. (GE 12) State A criminal record and an FBI \nidentification record both show that Applicant was arrested in May 2012 for assault of a \nfamily member. Two months later, in July 2012, the charge was nolle prossed. (GE 9-\n10) Applicant did not disclose his May 2012 arrest for assault of a family member on his \n2014 or 2017 SCA. (GE 1-2) It is important to note that during his interview in \nSeptember 2014, Applicant provided a different account of the incident. He stated the \npolice were called to their apartment in May 2012 due a loud argument, and the policy \nof State A police is that one of the individuals involved in the domestic disturbance must \nbe arrested if the police are called to investigate. In May 2012, Applicant volunteered \n(emphasis added) to go with the police because his wife already had several criminal \nconvictions. He spent about eight hours in jail, he met with a magistrate, paid a fine, and \n\n \n8 \n \n \nwas then released. Applicant did not list the arrest on the SCA as he was unaware that \nhe had been charged with any criminal offense. (GE 11)  \n \nSOR allegation \u00b6 1.e alleges that Applicant was arrested in December 2015 for \nassault of a family member (wife). As indicated previously, Applicant claimed the \nneighbors called the police on multiple occasions whenever he and his wife got into a \nloud argument. On this particular night, he and his wife were having a loud verbal \nargument. He left the residence and stayed overnight in a hotel. The next morning, \nApplicant was arrested by the police for assault after leaving his hotel room. Since it \nwas a holiday weekend, he was held in jail for three days before he could see a judge. \n(Tr. 52-54; GE 9; AE G) \n \nWhile sitting in jail, Applicant realized he had a company payroll cycle that \nneeded attention, but he did not have his business partner\u2019s telephone number \nmemorized. The only phone number he had memorized was his wife\u2019s phone number. \nApplicant claimed he did not realize that a protective order had been issued, so he \ncalled his wife from jail. They had a cordial conversation, and he asked her to call his \nbusiness partner to handle the company payroll. Applicant was then rearrested for \nviolation of a protection order. (SOR \u00b6 1.f) The protective order remained valid for a \nperiod of five months. Applicant had to move into his own apartment. Applicant \naccepted a deferred sentence agreement which required him to successfully complete \n24 weeks of an anger management program, and successfully complete two years of \nprobation without further violations. The violation of a protective order was nolle prossed \nin March 2016. Applicant successfully completed the anger management program in \nSeptember 2016, and the assault of a family member charge was dismissed in March \n2018. (Tr. 54-58; GE 9; AE G) \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the AG. In addition to brief introductory explanations \nfor each guideline, the AG list potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating \nconditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified \ninformation. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \n\n \n9 \n \n \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 an \u201capplicant is responsible \nfor presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate \nfacts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the ultimate \nburden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\u201d  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk that an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline E: Personal Conduct \n \n \nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the security concern for personal conduct:  \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \nprovide truthful and candid answers during national security investigative \nor adjudicative processes. \u2026 \n \n \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and be \ndisqualifying. The following are potentially applicable under the established facts \nin this case: \n \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or \nsimilar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment \n\n \n10 \n \n \nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine national security \neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities; \n \n(b) deliberately providing false or misleading information; or concealing or \nomitting information, concerning relevant facts to an employer, \ninvestigator, security official,\u2026 in making a recommendation relevant to a \nnational security eligibility determination, and  \n \n(d) credible adverse information that is not explicitly covered under any \nother guideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an adverse \ndetermination, but which, when combined with all available information, \nsupports a whole-person assessment of questionable judgment, \nuntrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply \nwith rules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that the \nindividual may not properly safeguard classified or sensitive information.  \nThis includes, but is not limited to: \n \n \n(3) a pattern of dishonesty or rule violations; and \n \n(4) evidence of significant misuse of Government or other \nemployer\u2019s time or resources. \n \n \nApplicant deliberately falsified SCAs and background interviews concerning his \nemployment and termination history with the Peace Corps and GSA. He intentionally \nfailed to fully disclose the circumstances of his workplace misconduct, and he provided \ncontradictory and inconsistent statements throughout multiple security clearance \ninvestigations. While serving as a government contracting officer in Iraq, Applicant was \naccused of setting up a sham company, bribery, and receiving monetary kickbacks for \nawarding contacts to companies involved in the scheme. He was arrested on more than \none occasion for assault on a family member, and he was arrested for violation of a \nprotection order. As recently as 2018, the court dismissed an assault charge against \nApplicant after his completion of anger management classes and two years of \nprobation. Applicant did not disclose his full criminal history on the SCAs, and he \nprovided contradictory statements about his May 2012 assault arrest during two \nbackground interviews. Applicant admitted to intentionally accessing pornography on a \ngovernment computer, but his previous accounts of how he accessed these websites, \nand whether he did so intentionally, were also inconsistent. The above disqualifying \nconditions apply. \n \n \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns \narising from personal conduct. The following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 17 are \npotentially applicable: \n \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts;  \n \n\n \n11 \n \n \n(b) the refusal or failure to cooperate, omission, or concealment was \ncaused or significantly contributed to by advice of legal counsel or of a \nperson with professional responsibilities for advising or instructing the \nindividual specifically concerning security processes. Upon being made \naware of the requirement to cooperate or provide the information, the \nindividual cooperated fully and truthfully; \n \n(c) the offense is so minor or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; and  \n \n(d) the individual acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling to \nchange the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, \nunreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely \nto recur. \n \n \n \nNone of the mitigating conditions apply. I did not find Applicant\u2019s testimony \ncredible. He has not made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct omissions or \nfalsifications provided during the course of several security clearance investigations. His \nclaim that either a judge\u2019s ruling, or a company settlement agreement, preventing him \nfrom disclosing his workplace misconduct pursuant to a \u201cgag order\u201d is self-serving and \nunconvincing. He demonstrates a pattern of dishonesty, which casts doubt on his \nreliability, trustworthiness, and overall good judgment. Many of his statements and \nexplanations were uncorroborated. After reviewing his history of misconduct and deceit, \nI find that it is probable Applicant\u2019s inappropriate behavior is likely to recur. \n \n \n \n \n \n  Whole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \n\n \n12 \n \n \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the \npotentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and \ncircumstances surrounding this case. This SOR highlights serious offenses that \nprovides insight to Applicant\u2019s character and integrity. Applicant is not remorseful for his \nmisconduct or deceit. His explanations are self-serving and insincere. I conclude that \nApplicant has not mitigated security concerns raised by his personal conduct. \nAccordingly, Applicant has not carried his burden of showing that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant his eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline E:  \n \n      AGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.n: \n \n \n      Against Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national security to grant Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security \nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n                \n \n \nPamela C. Benson \nAdministrative Judge \n",

Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nStatement of the Case \nApplicant submitted a security clearance application (e-QIP) on February 6, 2015. \nOn October 13, 2017, the Department of Defense (DOD) sent him a Statement of \nReasons \n(SOR), \nalleging \nsecurity \nconcerns \nunder \nGuidelines \nF \n(Financial \nConsiderations). The DOD acted under Executive Order (Ex. Or.) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) implemented by \nDOD on June 8, 2017.  \nApplicant submitted his Answer to the SOR on November 30, 2017, and requested \na hearing before an administrative judge. Department Counsel was ready to proceed on \nFebruary 21, 2018, and the case was assigned to me on March 20, 2018. On May 22, \n2018, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) notified Applicant that the \n04/10/2019\n\n2 \n \nhearing was scheduled for June 7, 2018. I convened the hearing as scheduled. \nGovernment Exhibits (GX) 1 and 2 were admitted into evidence without objection. \nApplicant testified, called one witness, and submitted Applicant\u2019s Exhibit (AX) A, which \nwas admitted without objection. DOHA received the transcript (Tr.) on June 12, 2018. \n \nProcedural Issues \n \n \nApplicant appeared at the hearing with a personal representative. However, both \nApplicant and the personal representative were unfamiliar with the hearing process. It \nwas Applicant\u2019s intention for the personal representative to testify on Applicant\u2019s behalf. \nWe resolved this issue as follows: Both parties waived opening statements and the \npersonal representative testified on Applicant\u2019s behalf, and then acted as Applicant\u2019s \npersonal representative. \n \n \nAt the start of the hearing, Department Counsel moved to amend the SOR \nallegations, and further stated that he might make an additional motion at the end of the \nhearing. I granted Department Counsel\u2019s motion and Applicant was initially uncertain as \nto whether or not he was prepared to proceed with the hearing. I stated that I would leave \nthe record open for 30 days in order to permit Applicant to more fully respond to the \namended allegations and to submit additional documentation. Under these conditions, \nApplicant determined that he was prepared to proceed with the hearing. Department \nCounsel moved to amend the SOR to conform to the evidence, and I granted his motion \nwithout objection. The record remained open until July 9, 2018. Applicant timely submitted \nAX B through H, which included a statement addressing the SOR amendments. I admitted \nthe additional evidence without objection. \n  \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant, 56, is a senior software systems engineer currently employed by a \ndefense contractor since April 2008. He was previously employed in the same position by \ndefense contractors since at least 2002. Applicant worked as a Federal employee from \n1988 until 1997. He earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in electrical engineering in 1985. He and \nhis wife married in 1982 and have three adult children. He was granted his first security \nclearance in 1988. (GX 1.)  \n \nUnder Guideline F, the SOR as amended alleges that Applicant failed to timely file \nhis state and federal tax returns for tax years 2011 through 2016. Applicant admits the \nSOR allegations. The delinquent tax filings are documented in Applicant\u2019s responses to \ninterrogatories, Answer, and documentary submissions. His admissions are incorporated \nin my findings of fact. \n \nApplicant does not have any formal training in tax preparation. He prepares and \nfiles his own tax returns using tax-preparation software, due in large measure to his \nconcern that accountants and tax preparers are likely targets of hacking. For many years, \nApplicant erroneously believed that if he was entitled to a refund from the IRS, he was \nnot required to file his tax return on the annual deadline, but was instead required to file \n\n3 \n \nwithin three years of the annual deadline or he would forfeit his refund. (GX 2; Tr. 37-38; \nAnswer.) Applicant also stated that his state of residence withholds refunds after two \nyears, so he historically tried to file his Federal and state taxes within two years of the \ndeadline. (Tr. 37-38.) \n \nApplicant attributes his late tax filings primarily to the complexity of his taxes, his \nmisconception about filing requirements, and his efforts to maintain balance in his family \nand work lives. (Answer.) The issues and events that Applicant identifies as having made \nhis tax accounting and preparation complex, and his filings and payments delinquent, are \ndiscussed more fully below. \n \nIn 2002, Applicant\u2019s wife was in a serious car accident in which she was gravely \ninjured. She suffered from ongoing health issues for many years that required frequent \nmedical attention. Applicant incurred significant medical costs, and itemized these on his \ntax returns. (GX 2; Tr. 50.) Applicant\u2019s wife\u2019s health deteriorated in 2012 and 2013, and \nshe underwent surgery in 2014 as a result of the injuries she received in the accident. \nThrough the years, Applicant prioritized his wife\u2019s medical care and concern over her \nhealth over preparing his tax returns. (Answer.) \n \nIn approximately 2008, Applicant started a two-pronged business venture. He \npurchased a used recreational vehicle (RV) with the intention of refurbishing it and \nreselling it. He also bought an online subscription service that was theoretically designed \nto permit Applicant to purchase deeply discounted vacation packages to resell. A \ncomponent of the vacation-sale business was to recruit other people to purchase and sell \nthe packages, and Applicant would receive a percentage of their sales. Applicant did not \ngenerate any reportable income from either part of the business, nor did he ever obtain a \nbusiness license. (GX 2; Answer.) However, the business did generate expenses that \nApplicant itemized on his tax returns. Applicant did not keep business records in real time \nand this complicated his ability to gather information in order to timely file his tax returns. \n(Tr. 53-58.) Applicant officially closed the business in June 2016. (Answer.) \n \nIn tax year 2011, Applicant\u2019s then-employer issued stock options to its employees, \nincluding Applicant. Because of the way the employer issued the stock options, the value \nof the options was imputed to the employees as income, which necessarily increased \ntheir tax obligations. The employer sent Applicant an IRS Schedule K-1 that was incorrect. \nApplicant contacted the employer, which in turn contacted the IRS to amend the Schedule \nK-1s. It took several years for this issue to be corrected, and Applicant did not file his tax \nreturns while the issue was pending. (GX 2.) It is unclear when the schedule K-1 was \namended. Applicant sold the stocks in April 2017 and received his last Schedule K-1 in \nMarch 2017. (Tr. 63-65.) \n \nIt took Applicant approximately 440 hours to do the accounting and tax preparation \nfor tax year 2014. Despite this large investment of time, Applicant miscalculated his tax \nobligation and owed approximately $90. He filed the 2014 Federal return in July 2017, \nand paid the amount due in September 2017. (GX 2; Tr. 45-46; Answer.) \n \n\n4 \n \nApplicant spoke extensively about his delinquent tax filings during his personal \nsubject interview (PSI) in May 2015. Applicant identified tax year 2011 as the year he \nbegan having difficulty in his tax accounting and preparation in both his e-QIP and his \nPSI. He stated because of his difficulties filing his 2011 tax returns, he was unable to \ntimely file 2012, 2013, and 2014. He filed his 2011 Federal return on April 21, 2015. He \nanticipated filing his 2013 and 2014 tax returns soon. Additionally, the IRS sent inquiries \nto Applicant for non-filing of tax returns in at least 2012, 2013, and 2016. (GX 2; Answer.) \n \nApplicant signed his responses to DOHA\u2019s interrogatories on October 4, 2017. The \ninterrogatories required Applicant to submit IRS account transcripts for tax years 2011 \nthrough 2016. Applicant stated that his 2016 state and Federal tax returns remained \nunfiled. However, his 2015 state and Federal returns were also unfiled. He filed his 2015 \nFederal return on October 10, 2017. Applicant filed for an extension for his 2016 Federal \nreturn. However, he missed the October 15, 2017, deadline and filed the return on \nNovember 24, 2017. (GX 2; Tr. 43-45; Answer.). \n \nThe instructions section of IRS Form 1040, updated annually, specifically sets forth \nthe filing requirements for that tax year. For example, in 2011 married couples filing jointly \nwith both spouses under the age of 65 with a gross income of at least $20,600 were \nrequired to file a Federal return by April 18, 2016.1 Applicant\u2019s income has exceeded the \nannual minimum gross income for tax years 2011 through 2016.2 (Answer.) Applicant was \ngenerally entitled to receive refunds from the IRS. However, he forfeited his 2011 refund \nby filing the return more than three years after the filing deadline on April 21, 2015. \nApplicant filed automatic extensions for several tax years, but did not meet the October \n15 deadlines. (GX 2; Tr. 40-43; Answer.)  \n \nApplicant filed an extension for his 2017 Federal tax return, which moved his \ndeadline to October 15, 2018. However, Applicant\u2019s accounting and tax preparation \nresulted in Applicant\u2019s owing Federal tax for 2017. He was required by Federal law to \nsubmit his payment by the April 2018 filing deadline. On May 31, 2018, Applicant filed the \nreturn with a check for $2,500 for tax payment. (AX A.) Further, this submission occurred \none week after Applicant acknowledged receipt of the Notice of Hearing.3 Regarding his \n2017 return, Applicant stated: \n \nIt is interesting that my 2017 \"Application for Automatic Extension of Time \nto File\" projects us receiving a $300 refund while my actual tax filing shows \nus owing additional taxes. In other words, we made yet another mistake. It \nis a humbling lesson learned for me going forward that estimates (just like \n2014) can be wrong. (AX B.) \n \n                                            \n1 The relevant pages from 2011 1040 instructions from www.irs.gov are appended to the record as Administrative \nExhibit (AD EX) IV. \n \n2 See www.irs.gov. \n \n3 The email acknowledging receipt of the Notice of Hearing is appended to the file as AD EX II. Appellant\u2019s sheet of \ncorrections of the transcript is amended to the file as AD EX III. \n\n5 \n \nIt is unclear when Applicant realized he was required to file by the IRS deadlines \nregardless of whether or not he was entitled to a refund, but it was at some point prior to \nfiling his Answer on November 30, 2017. However, Applicant also stated in his Answer \nthat his \u201cprevious security investigations revealed this same issue since [his] wife\u2019s wreck \nin 2001 and since the start of [his] business in 2008.\u201d Upon receiving the SOR, he realized \nthat his practice of delinquently filing his tax returns could have a negative impact on his \nsecurity clearance. (Tr. 67-70.)  \n \nApplicant does not owe any balance for his 2014 state tax. However, as of \nSeptember 28, 2017, Applicant had not filed his 2015 and 2016 state tax returns. \n(Answer.) Applicant filed his 2017 state tax return on May 31, 2018. (AX A.) \n \nApplicant thinks filing his tax returns will be simplified now that he no longer has to \nwait for a Schedule K-1 or incorporate the information from it into his tax calculations, but \ninstead receives a standard employee W-2. (Tr. 66.) Applicant stated that because he \nwas operating under the misconception that he had three years to file if he was owed a \nrefund from the IRS, he did not think he was violating any laws. (Tr. 70.) Applicant stated \nseveral times that he remains circumspect about hiring a tax preparer or accountant out \nof concern that Applicant\u2019s personal information will be hacked. His current intention is to \ncontinue preparing his own tax returns. (Tr. 64-73.) Applicant does not have any \ndelinquent accounts or other financial issues. (AX C-AX H.) Now that Applicant is aware \nof the negative impact his delinquent filing of his Federal and state tax returns could have \non his security eligibility, he intends to timely file all future tax returns. (Tr. 70-71.) \n  \n \nApplicant\u2019s witness, a security specialist who has worked with Applicant for more \nthan 11 years, holds a security clearance. She is aware of the SOR allegations. She \ntestified that Applicant is trustworthy and reliable, stating that he has identified and helped \nto rectify several data spillages that were potentially damaging, and that he has never \ncaused a security-related incident. (Tr. 28-31.) Applicant provided character references \nfrom his supervisor since 2003, a friend of over 30 years, a coworker since 2008, and a \nformer coworker and friend of 28 years. Each is aware of the SOR allegations. \nCollectively, they stated that Applicant is a person of integrity who is skilled in his \nprofession. Given Applicant\u2019s character and trustworthiness, they highly recommend \nApplicant for continued access to classified information. (Answer.) \n \nPolicies \n \n \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended.  \n \n\n6 \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant\u2019s meeting the \ncriteria contained in the AG. These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, \nrecognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge applies these \nguidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative \njudge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available and reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable. \n \n \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d  See Exec. Or. \n10865 \u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the \napplicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense \nhave established for issuing a clearance. \n \n \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 92-1106 at 3, \n1993 WL 545051 at *3 (App. Bd. Oct. 7, 1993).  \n \n \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, \nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-\n31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).  \n \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-\n20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b).  \n \n \n \n \n\n7 \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18:  \n \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness \nto abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about an \nindividual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified or \nsensitive information. \n \n \n \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an individual might knowingly \ncompromise classified information in order to raise money. It encompasses concerns \nabout an individual\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting \nclassified information. An individual who is financially irresponsible may also be \nirresponsible, unconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified \ninformation. See ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \n \n \nThe record evidence establishes the following disqualifying condition: \n \nAG \u00b6 19(f): failure to file . . . annual Federal, state, or local income tax \nreturns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired.  \n \n \nThe following mitigating conditions are potentially applicable: \n \nAG \u00b6 20(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not \ncast doubt on the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \nAG \u00b6 20(b): the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; and \n \nAG \u00b6 20(g): the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax \nauthority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \n \n \nApplicant did not timely file his Federal and state tax returns for 2011 through 2016, \ndespite receiving extensions for many years. He did not timely pay his 2014 and 2017 tax \nobligations. The 2011 inaccurate tax reporting by Applicant\u2019s employer and Applicant\u2019s \nwife\u2019s medical expenses were conditions that were beyond Applicant\u2019s control. These \n\n8 \n \nconditions added complexity to Applicant\u2019s accounting and tax preparation, which \ncontributed to his inability to timely file his tax returns. It is understandable that Applicant \nwanted to maintain balance with his personal and professional lives and to prioritize his \nwife\u2019s care. Further, it is not unreasonable for Applicant to be concerned that his personal \ninformation could be at risk through hacking. Nevertheless, Applicant did not act \nresponsibly under the circumstances. There are a myriad of options that Applicant could \nhave employed to protect his personal information when using the services of a tax \nprofessional. For example, Applicant could ensure that the tax professional computed \nApplicant\u2019s taxes without entering his personal information. The computed tax information \ncould then be entered by Applicant and submitted to the taxing authority. \n \n \nApplicant also attributes his pattern of failing to timely file his tax returns to his \nmisconception about his filing requirements. Applicant is college educated and has \nworked as a software systems engineer since at least 2002. The 1040 instructions clearly \nset forth the filing requirements and these requirements have applied to Applicant for all \ntax years in question. It is unclear exactly when Applicant fully understood that he is \nrequired to file his Federal tax return annually by the IRS deadlines established by the \nIRS. \n  \n \nFurther, Applicant has been given notice that the government is concerned about \ntimely filing of taxes by the questions asked on his 2015 e-QIP, and likely during his \nprevious background investigations. Applicant was also questioned extensively about his \nfailure to timely file his taxes during his May 2015 PSI. Applicant had to have understood \nthe security concern raised by his pattern of delinquently filing his tax returns when he \nreceived DOHA\u2019s interrogatories in September 2017. The fact that Applicant filed his 2015 \ntax return the day after he completed his responses to interrogatories underscores the \nfact that Applicant understood that his failure to timely file his tax returns had security \nclearance implications.  \n \n \nHowever, despite having received the SOR in October 2017, Applicant did not file \nhis 2016 Federal tax return until November 24, 2017, well after the extension deadline. \nHe did not timely pay his 2018 Federal tax obligation. Applicant filed his 2017 return, the \nfirst return filed within an extension period, and paid his tax obligation only after receiving \nthe hearing notice. Applicant asserted that he will timely file his future tax returns now that \nhe is aware of the security clearance implications. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s overarching motivation for his last-minute efforts to comply with his tax-\nfiling obligations, as well as his future promise of compliance, is protecting his security \nclearance. The appeal board has regularly held that \u201capplicants who only begin to address \ntheir security-significant conduct when their personal interests are at stake may be lacking \nin judgment and reliability. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 15-06707 at 3 (App. Bd. Aug. 15, \n2017.)  \n \n \nIn specifically addressing mitigating condition 20(g) in ISCR Case No. 17-01807 \n(App. Bd. Mar. 7, 2018), the appeal board observed: \n \n\n9 \n \nThe mere filing of delinquent tax returns or the existence of a payment \nagreement with an appropriate tax authority does not compel a Judge to \nissue a favorable decision. As with the application of any mitigating \ncondition, the Judge must examine the record evidence and decide whether \nthe favorable evidence outweighs the unfavorable evidence or vice versa. \nThe timing of corrective action is an appropriate factor for the judge to \nconsider in the application of [this mitigating condition]. pp 3-4. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s pattern of failing to timely file his Federal and state tax returns is recent \nand raises concerns about his willingness to abide by rules and regulations, and his \ncurrent reliability and judgment. While many factors contributed to Applicant\u2019s failure to \ntimely file his Federal and state tax returns for many years, he did not act reasonably \nunder those circumstances. None of the mitigating conditions apply. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-\nperson concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances in light of the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2.  \n \n \nI have incorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. \nSome of the factors in AG \u00b6 2 were addressed under that guideline, but I have also \nconsidered the following: \n \n \n \nApplicant has held a security clearance since 1988. His supervisor, coworkers, and \nfriends highly recommend Applicant for a continued security clearance. He is a skilled \nprofessional. However, through his failure to timely file and pay his taxes, Applicant has \nnot demonstrated the judgment and reliability required of individuals granted access to \nclassified information. \n \n \nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under Guideline F, and \nevaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has \nnot mitigated the security concerns raised by his failure to timely file his tax returns taxes \nas required. Accordingly, I conclude he has not carried his burden of showing that it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant him continued eligibility for access to \nclassified information. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n10 \n \nFormal Findings \n \nAs required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, I make the following \nformal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \n \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F (Financial Considerations): AGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a and 1.b: \n  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to continue \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information \nis denied. \n \n \n \nStephanie C. Hess \nAdministrative Judge \n \n \n \n \n",

Sykstus, Esq. \n______________ \nDecision \n______________ \nHESS, Stephanie C., Administrative Judge: \nThis case involves security concerns raised under Guideline J (Criminal Conduct). \nApplicant has mitigated the security concerns raised by his 2012 arrest for felony \naggravated child abuse. Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \nStatement of the Case \nApplicant submitted a security clearance application (e-QIP) on May 21, 2013. On \nDecember 23, 2016, the Department of Defense (DOD) sent him a Statement of Reasons \n(SOR), alleging security concerns under Guideline J. The DOD acted under Executive \nOrder (Ex. Or.) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, \n1960), as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security \nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the \nadjudicative guidelines (AG) implemented by the DOD on September 1, 2006.  \nApplicant answered the SOR and requested a hearing before an administrative \njudge. Department Counsel was ready to proceed on February 22, 2017, and the case \nwas assigned to me on March 20, 2018. On May 21, 2018, the Defense Office of Hearings \nand Appeals (DOHA) notified Applicant that the hearing was scheduled for June 6, 2018. \n03/14/2019\n\n2 \n \nI convened the hearing as scheduled. Government Exhibits (GX) 1 through 4 were \nadmitted in evidence without objection. Applicant testified, submitted Applicant\u2019s Exhibits \n(AX) A through Q, which were admitted without objection, and called four witnesses. \nDOHA received the transcript (Tr.) on June 14, 2018. \n \nThe SOR was issued under the AG implemented on September 1, 2006. The DOD \nimplemented the amended AG on June 8, 2017, while this decision was pending. This \ndecision will be decided based on the amended AG effective June 8, 2017.  \n \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant is a 52-year-old engineering manager currently employed by a defense \ncontractor since October 2015, and employed in the defense industry since 1993. He has \nheld a clearance since 1996. He earned a bachelor of science degree in mathematics in \n1993. He and his current wife married in 2004. They have a blended family with three \nchildren ages 19, 18, and 11. (GX 1.)  \n \nThe SOR alleges under Guideline J that Applicant was arrested in October 2012 \nand charged with felony aggravated child abuse. The arrest was based on accusations \nmade by Applicant\u2019s oldest son and Applicant\u2019s ex-wife. Applicant admits that he was \narrested, but denies that he committed any criminal act. \n \nApplicant and his ex-wife married in 1996 and divorced in November 2004. At the \ntime of the divorce, Applicant and his ex-wife had a 5-year-old son. Following the divorce, \nApplicant and his ex-wife have repeatedly returned to court over issues of custody and \nchild support. Their relationship is contentious, at best. (AX A - AX E.) \n \nIn October 2012, Applicant and his ex-wife had joint custody of their 12-year-old \nson. At the request of his ex-wife, Applicant went to her house to discipline their son. \nApplicant\u2019s ex-wife met Applicant in the driveway and showed him marks on her wrists \nwhere their son had grabbed her while she was trying to punish him for failing math. \nApplicant entered the house and confronted his son. Applicant, in the presence of his ex-\nwife, removed his belt and hit his son three times with it for being disrespectful to his \nmother. Applicant further told his son that he would not be permitted to participate in any \nextracurricular activities until his math grade improved. (Tr. 28-31.) \n \nThe following week, Applicant had custody of his son. Applicant learned from a \nfriend of his daughter\u2019s that Applicant\u2019s son had posted, \u201cI hate my f-ing dad\u2019s guts\u201d on a \nsocial media account. Applicant was distressed by the post, but was also distressed \nbecause he did not allow his children to have social media accounts. (Tr. 32-33.) \n \nApplicant logged in to the site and pulled up his son\u2019s post. Applicant showed the \npost to his son and demanded that his son read the post aloud. His son was clearly afraid, \nand refused to read the post. Applicant \u201cpopped\u201d his son in the back of the head and \nagain demanded that his son read the post aloud. His son refused. Applicant grabbed his \nson by the front of the shirt and catching his son\u2019s leather necklace, a scuffle ensued, and \n\n3 \n \nApplicant\u2019s son ended up on the kitchen floor, screaming and crying. Applicant told his \nson to calm down and go to bed. (Tr. 32-36.) \n \nThe next morning, Applicant\u2019s son wore a shirt buttoned to the neck to school. In \nthe early afternoon, Applicant got a telephone call informing him that he needed to go to \nthe county\u2019s child advocacy center for some issues with his son. When Applicant arrived, \nhis ex-wife\u2019s car was already there. Applicant was met by county officers who wanted to \ndiscuss aggravated child abuse charges with Applicant. Applicant\u2019s ex-wife had told the \nofficers about the incident the night before, as well as the spanking incident the previous \nweek, which combined, rose to the level of felony aggravated child abuse. (Tr. 36-40.) \n \nApplicant was shown photographs of his son\u2019s neck which had multiple red marks \non it. Applicant did not see any marks on his son\u2019s neck following the scuffle or the next \nmorning because of his son\u2019s fully buttoned shirt, but believes they were possibly caused \nin part by the leather necklace, but were primarily self-inflicted by his son. (Tr. 90-91; GX \n2; Tr. 61-63.) \n \nApplicant was indicted by a grand jury, arrested, and charged with felony \naggravated child abuse. (GX 4.) He properly reported the arrest to his facility security \nofficer who instructed Applicant to keep the security office informed. Applicant\u2019s ex-wife \nimmediately filed for child support and sole custody of their son. Following the indictment, \nthe contract on which Applicant was working went to another contractor and Applicant \nwas laid off. Despite submitting hundreds of job applications, Applicant was unemployed \nfor approximately 11 months. (Tr. 38-41.)   \n \nAfter approximately two years, in September 2014, on the advice of his attorney, \nApplicant pled guilty to third-degree assault, a misdemeanor. He was sentenced to one \nyear in prison, which was suspended for two years; two years\u2019 supervised probation; a \n$500 fine; $250 restitution; and 40 hours community service. Applicant was also required \nto complete: a domestic violence program; a parenting program; an anger management \nprogram; and undergo an assessment for drug or alcohol abuse. A protective order in \nApplicant\u2019s son\u2019s favor was entered against Applicant which required him to have no \ncontact with his son. (GX 4.) Applicant completed restitution in March 2016, all other court \nrequirements between 2013 and 2015, and was released from probation without violation \nin October 2015. (AX F - AX J.) Applicant has not had any contact with his son since \n2012. (Tr. 40-41.) \n \nApplicant\u2019s wife, who was present during the incident with Applicant\u2019s son, \nrecounted the events in accord with Applicant. The following day, she met Applicant at \nthe child advocacy center, and was interviewed and gave a written statement to the police \nwherein she emphatically stated that Applicant had not abused his son. Applicant\u2019s wife \nwas shown pictures of the marks on Applicant\u2019s son\u2019s neck, and was shocked. She \ntestified that there were no markings or injuries on Applicant\u2019s son\u2019s neck when he went \nto bed after the incident. (Tr. 77-85.) She further testified to the strength of character of \nApplicant, and stated that Applicant is a devoted father to all of their children and would \nnever abuse any of them. (Tr. 75-76.)  \n\n4 \n \nApplicant\u2019s mother testified that Applicant has never been an overly strict \ndisciplinarian, and has been a very involved father for all of his children. (Tr. 100-102.) \nApplicant\u2019s friend, who is also a pastor, stated that Applicant discussed the situation with \nhis son with him, and that Applicant was deeply affected by the situation. (Tr. 107.) \nApplicant\u2019s friend of over 13 years, who is a public school nurse and was previously an \nemergency room nurse, has witnessed victims of child abuse. She has observed \nApplicant and his wife around all of their children and has never witnessed any type or \npattern of abuse in their household. (Tr. 112 \u2013 113.) \n \nApplicant\u2019s testimony was credible and remorseful. The summary of Applicant\u2019s \npersonal subject interview (PSI) and his Answer are consistent with his testimony and his \nwife\u2019s testimony. Applicant has never been accused of any other abuse. Applicant wrote \na letter to his son at the time of the incident stating \u201cI\u2019m here for you.\u201d He has maintained \nthe same cell phone numbers and hopes and prays that someday his son will contact \nhim. (Tr. 66.) \n \n \nPolicies \n \n \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended.  \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant\u2019s meeting the \ncriteria contained in the AG. These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, \nrecognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge applies these \nguidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative \njudge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available and reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable. \n \n \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d  See Exec. Or. \n10865 \u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the \n\n5 \n \napplicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense \nhave established for issuing a clearance. \n \n \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 92-1106 at 3, \n1993 WL 545051 at *3 (App. Bd. Oct. 7, 1993).  \n \n \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, \nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-\n31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).  \n \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-\n20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nThe concern under Guideline J (Criminal Conduct) is set out in AG \u00b6 30:  \n \nCriminal activity creates doubt about a person's judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person's ability or \nwillingness to comply with laws, rules and regulations.  \n \nThe following disqualifying condition applies under this guideline:  \n \nAG \u00b6 31(b) evidence (including, but not limited to, a credible allegation, \nadmission, and matters of official record) of criminal conduct, regardless of \nwhether the person was formally charged, formally prosecuted, or \nconvicted. \n \n \nThe following mitigating conditions are potentially applicable: \n \nAG \u00b6 32(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior \nhappened, or it happened under such unusual circumstances, that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; and \n\n6 \n \n \nAG \u00b6 32(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including, but not \nlimited to, the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, \nrestitution, compliance with the terms of parole or probation, job training or \nhigher education, good employment record, or constructive community \ninvolvement. \n \nApplicant was indicted for felony aggravated child abuse. He later pled guilty to \nthird-degree assault, a misdemeanor. He has not had any contact with his son since 2012. \nHe completed all court-ordered requirements and was released from probation without \nviolation in 2015. Applicant admits that he spanked him on one occasion and that he \nsmacked the back of his son\u2019s head and grabbed him up out of the chair by the front of \nhis shirt on another occasion. There is no history of reported abuse prior to these two \nincidents that occurred in 2012, nor are there any more recent allegations of any type of \nabuse of Applicant\u2019s other two children. These two incidents with Applicant\u2019s son occurred \nmore than six years ago under circumstances that are not likely to recur. The incidents \ndo not cast doubt on Applicant\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment. \nSince 2012, Applicant paid restitution, successfully completed all requirements of \nprobation, has regained employment with a defense contractor, and continues to be a \nyouth-sports coach in his community. He regrets the loss of his relationship with his son \nand hopes he will contact him in the future. AG \u00b6\u00b6 32(a) and 32(d) apply. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-\nperson concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process \nfactors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a).  \n \nApplicant has held a security clearance since 1996. He properly reported his arrest \nto his employer. Applicant is remorseful for his past conduct. \n \nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under Guideline J, and \nevaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has \nmitigated the security concerns raised by his arrest. Accordingly, I conclude he has \ncarried his burden of showing that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant \nhim eligibility for access to classified information. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n7 \n \nFormal Findings \n \nAs required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, I make the following \nformal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline J (Criminal Conduct) \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nI conclude that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant\u2019s \neligibility for a security clearance.

Katauskas, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro se\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nMETZ, John Grattan, Jr., Administrative Judge:\nBased on the record in this case,  I deny Applicant\u2019s clearance.\n1\nOn 20 August 2016, the Department of Defense (DoD) sent Applicant a\nStatement of Reasons (SOR) raising security concerns under Guideline F, Financial\nConsiderations, Guideline J, Criminal Conduct, and Guideline E, Personal Conduct.2\nApplicant timely answered the SOR, requesting a decision without hearing by the\nDefense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA). The record in this case closed 25\nMarch 2017, when Applicant\u2019s response to the FORM was due. Applicant provided no\nadditional documents. DOHA assigned the case to me 1 October 2017.\nConsisting of the File of Relevant Material (FORM), Items 1-8 .\n1\nDoD acted under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information Within Industry (February 20,\n2\n1960), as amended; DoD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program\n(January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) effective within the DoD on\n1 September 2006. On 10 December 2016, the Director of National Intelligence (DNI) signed Security\nExecutive Agent Directive 4, implementing new AG, effective with any decision issued on or after 8 June 2017. \n1\n   12/11/2018\n\nFindings of Fact\nApplicant is a 46-year-old configuration manager employed by a U.S. defense\ncontractor since October 2013. She has served previously in similar positions with a\nseries of defense contractors since May 1992. She has had small gaps in employment\nas her currently employer lost its bid on the renewal contract, only to have herself be\nhired by the successor contractor. The longest such gap was from December 2005 to\nJune 2006. She seeks to retain the clearance she was issued in July 2007 (Item 5, 6).\nThe SOR alleges, and Government exhibits (Items 6-8) establish,12 delinquent\ndebts totaling nearly $12,000, and a May 2005 Chapter 7 bankruptcy petition which was\ndischarged in June 2005. Applicant admitted some debts, and the bankruptcy; claimed\nthat some debts had been included in her bankruptcy; and claimed to have been\nunaware of some other debts. She listed no delinquent debts on her December 2014\nclearance application (Item 5), but was confronted with them during an April 2015\ninterview with a Government investigator (Item 6) based on a January 2015 credit report\n(Item 7). She similarly failed to disclose a handful of criminal arrests/citations (SOR 2.a-\n2.f), but was confronted with them during her interview.3\nApplicant documented no efforts to address her debts, either after her interview or\nafter she received the SOR. She attributed her 2005 bankruptcy filing to her August 1997\ndivorce, but it is difficult to see this as anything but attenuated. She provided no budget\nor financial statement. She has not documented any financial or credit counseling. She\nprovided no work or character references, or any evidence of community involvement.\nPolicies\nThe adjudicative guidelines (AG) list factors for evaluating a person\u2019s suitability for\naccess to classified information. Administrative judges must assess disqualifying and\nmitigating conditions under each issue fairly raised by the facts and situation presented.\nEach decision must also reflect a fair, impartial, and commonsense consideration of the\nfactors listed in AG \u00b6 2(d). Any one disqualifying or mitigating condition is not, by itself,\nconclusive. However, specific adjudicative guidelines should be followed where a case\ncan be measured against them, as they represent policy guidance governing access to\nclassified information. Considering the SOR allegations and the evidence as a whole, the\nrelevant adjudicative guidelines are Guideline F (Financial Considerations). Guideline J\n(Criminal Conduct), and Guideline E (Personal Conduct).\nApplicant claimed that she thought the felony question (SOR 2.f) referred to the last seven years, and in any\n3\nevent, she had discussed the offense during her 2007 background investigation. She provided no\ncorroboration for this latter claim, but given the age of the offense (nearly 25 years at the time of her clearance\napplication) I find the allegation to hold little security significance. Regarding her omissions of her more-recent\ncriminal history and financial problems, she variously claimed to have forgotten them or to have listed them\non her clearance application. These explanations are less credible.\n2\n\nSecurity clearance decisions resolve whether it is clearly consistent with the\nnational interest to grant or continue an applicant\u2019s security clearance. The Government\nmust prove, by substantial evidence, controverted facts alleged in the SOR. If it does, \nthe burden shifts to applicant to refute, extenuate, or mitigate the Government\u2019s case.\nBecause no one has a right to a security clearance, the applicant bears a heavy burden\nof persuasion.\nPersons with access to classified information enter into a fiduciary relationship\nwith the Government based on trust and confidence. Therefore, the Government has a\ncompelling interest in ensuring each applicant possesses the requisite judgement,\nreliability, and trustworthiness of those who must protect national interests as their own.\nThe \u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d standard compels resolution of any\nreasonable doubt about an applicant\u2019s suitability for access in favor of the Government.4\nAnalysis\nThe Government established a case for disqualification under Guideline F, and\nApplicant did not mitigate the security concerns. Applicant has an extensive history of\nfinancial difficulties for which she did not provide any documentation of efforts to resolve\nher debts.5\nApplicant meets none of the mitigating conditions for financial considerations. \nShe has not clearly documented any efforts to resolve them.  Applicant did not document\n6\nthat her financial problems were due to circumstances beyond her control, and she\ndocumented no efforts to resolve them, either after her subject interview or after she\nreceived the SOR or FORM.  Applicant has had no credit or financial counseling, and\n7\nthere is no evidence any of the debts are being resolved.  Her lack of effort does not\n8\nconstitute a good-faith effort to address her debts.  In addition, Applicant has not\n9\ndemonstrated a track record of living within her means. Furthermore, Applicant provided\nno \u201cwhole-person\u201d evidence to mitigate the security concerns raised by her inaction on\nthe debts. Accordingly, I conclude Guideline F against Applicant.\nSee, Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518 (1988).\n4\n19(a) inability to satisfy debts; (b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so; (c) a history\n5\nof not meeting financial obligations;\n\u00b620(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such circumstances that\n6\nit is unlikely to recur . . . \n\u00b620(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s control . . . and\n7\nthe individual acted responsibly under the circumstances;\n\u00b620(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and there are clear indications that\n8\nthe problem is being resolved or is under control;\n\u00b620(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.\n9\n3\n\n \nIn similar fashion, the Government established cases for disqualification under\nGuidelines J and E. At a minimum, the circumstances of her criminal conduct and her\nclearance application omissions bespeak an inattentiveness to detail which is\ninconsistent with access to classified information. Her response to the SOR is largely a\nplea to save her job, but without a more thorough explanation of her criminal conduct\nand the clearance application omissions, she cannot mitigate the security concerns\nraised by these allegations. Accordingly, I conclude Guidelines J and E against\nApplicant.\n Formal Findings\nParagraph 1. Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs a-m:\nAgainst Applicant\nParagraph 2.

Or.) 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry, February 20, 1960; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense \nIndustrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (Directive), January 2, 1992; \nand Security Executive Agent Directive 4, establishing in Appendix A the National \nSecurity Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified \nInformation or Eligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position (AGs), effective June 8, 2017.   \nThe SOR detailed reasons why the DOD CAF did not find under the Directive that \nit is clearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant or continue a \nsecurity clearance for Applicant and recommended referral to an administrative judge to \ndetermine whether a clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked. \n01/08/2019\n\n \n2                                                                                                                                             \nSpecifically, the SOR set forth security concerns arising under the foreign influence and \nforeign preference guidelines.  \n \nOn October 30, 2016, Applicant responded to the SOR and requested a hearing. \n(Hearing Exhibit (HE) 3) On March 22, 2018, Department Counsel was ready to \nproceed. On May 2, 2018, the case was assigned to another administrative judge. On \nAugust 14, 2018, the case was transferred to me. On November 8, 2018, the Defense \nOffice of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a notice of hearing, setting the hearing \nfor December 13, 2018. (HE 1) Applicant\u2019s hearing was held as scheduled.  \n \nDuring the hearing, Department Counsel offered three exhibits; Applicant \nprovided eight exhibits; there were no objections; and all proffered exhibits were \nadmitted into evidence. (Transcript (Tr.) 13-17, 33-36; Government Exhibits (GE) 1-3; \nApplicant Exhibits (AE) A-I) On January 2, 2019, I received the transcript of the hearing.  \n \nProcedural Ruling \n \nDepartment Counsel offered summaries for administrative notice concerning \nforeign influence and foreign preference security concerns raised by Applicant\u2019s \nconnections to Iraq. Applicant did not object to me taking administrative notice of facts \nconcerning Iraq, and I granted Department Counsel\u2019s motion. (Tr. 9) Department \nCounsel and Applicant indicated they had no objection to me taking administrative \nnotice of facts from the U.S. Department of State website concerning Iraq.1 (Tr. 9-10) \nAdministrative or official notice is the appropriate type of notice used for administrative \nproceedings. See ISCR Case No. 16-02522 at 2-3 (App. Bd. July 12, 2017); ISCR Case \nNo. 05-11292 at 4 n. 1 (App. Bd. Apr. 12, 2007); ISCR Case No. 02-24875 at 2 (App. \nBd.

Immigration and Naturalization Service, 802 F.2d 89, 93 n. 4 (3d Cir. 1986)). \nUsually administrative notice at ISCR proceedings is accorded to facts that are either \nwell known or from government reports. See Stein, ADMINISTRATIVE LAW, Section 25.01 \n(Bender & Co. 2006) (listing fifteen types of facts for administrative notice).  \n \nPortions of the Department Counsel\u2019s requests are quoted without quotation \nmarks and footnotes in the Iraq section of this decision, infra.

(Tr. 10; HE \n3) He also provided mitigating information. (HE 3) His admissions are incorporated \nherein as findings of fact. After a complete and thorough review of the evidence of \nrecord, I make the following findings of fact. \n \nApplicant is a 56-year-old linguist, and DOD contractors have employed him \nsince April 2015 in Iraq. (Tr. 23) Shortly after his hearing, he returned to Iraq to continue \nhis linguist duties. (Tr. 26) His annual salary as a linguist is $80,000. (Tr. 23) Before \nbecoming a linguist, he worked in a hotel as a cook. (Tr. 23) In Iraq, before coming to \nthe United States, he worked in the oil industry. (Tr. 47) Applicant and his family are \nRoman Catholic,3 and he and his wife are from the Kurdistan region of Iraq. (Tr. 51-52, \n54)    \n \nIn 1984, Applicant received a technical degree with a specialty in petroleum. (AE \nA) From 1985 to 1987, he performed mandatory service in the Iraqi army. (AE A) In \n1989, he married, and his children are ages 24, 27, and 28. (Tr. 18-20) His spouse is 56 \nyears old. (Tr. 22) His children are citizens and residents of the United States. (Tr. 19-\n21) His father-in-law and mother-in-law are citizens and residents of the United States, \nand in 2006, they arranged for Applicant, his spouse, and their children\u2019s immigration to \nthe United States from Iraq. (Tr. 21-22, 53) In 2012, Applicant and his spouse were \nnaturalized as U.S. citizens. (Tr. 52) He has property in the United States including a \nhome and about $22,000 in his U.S. bank account. (Tr. 24; AE F) \n \nThe SOR alleges that Applicant has three relatives living in Iraq. His father and \none sister are citizens and residents of Kurdistan, a region of Iraq. (Tr. 26; SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a \nand 1.b; GE 1) His father and sister live together. (Tr. 27) His father is 84 years old and \nsuffers from cancer and high blood pressure. (Tr. 38) His mother is deceased. (Tr. 40) \nHis most recent visit with his father was in 2012, and he most recently communicated \nwith his father or sister two or three years ago. (Tr. 27-28) He does not send money to \nhis father or sister in Iraq. (Tr. 28) He does not own property or bank accounts in Iraq. \n(Tr. 28-29) When his father dies, he does not plan to go to Iraq for his father\u2019s funeral, \nand his father\u2019s property in Iraq will go to his sister in Iraq. (Tr. 39-41) His only visits to \nIraq after 2012 were on behalf of his employer. (Tr. 41) \n \nApplicant has a sister who lived in Iraq and is a citizen of Iraq. She currently \nresides in Germany with her husband. (Tr. 29; SOR \u00b6 1.c) He communicates with his \nsister in Germany, who provides information to Applicant about his family in Iraq. (Tr. \n39) \n \n                                            \n2 The facts in this decision do not specifically describe employment, names of witnesses, names \nof other groups, or locations in order to protect Applicant\u2019s and his family\u2019s privacy. The cited sources \ncontain more specific information. \n \n3 In accordance with \u201cwell established DoD policy [Applicant and his family\u2019s] religious affiliation \nplay[ed] no part\u201d in this decision. ISCR Case No. 08-06795 at 6 n. 3 (App. Bd. May 25, 2012). \n\n \n4                                                                                                                                             \nForeign Preference \n \nApplicant is not fluent in English. He admitted twice that he voted in an Iraqi \nelection in 2014. (Tr. 30; SOR response; Officer of Personnel Management (OPM) \npersonal subject interview (PSI); GE 2) In his OPM PSI, which is the investigator\u2019s \nsummary of his statement, he said he voted because he wanted to help Iraq become a \nbetter democratic country like the United States. (Tr. 44; GE 2) He may have simply \nagreed with the OPM investigator\u2019s statements about voting. Applicant explained in \nbroken English, \u201cIt\u2019s not a vote. There was misunderstood for me in that question, \nbecause they, did you practice or did you exercise this election. I said yes. Yeah I work \non it. I\u2019m not vote in it.\u201d (Tr. 31) He said he did not understand English \u201cvery good,\u201d and \u201cI \nwork there. It\u2019s not vote.\u201d (Tr. 44) \u201cI see a lot of Iraqis they come to vote. That one they \nvote in Iraq and they vote. For that I say it\u2019s allowed to Iraqis to vote who\u2019s living in the \nU.S. . . . So for that I say they allowed to me. But I\u2019m not voted on.\u201d (Tr. 45-46) He was \nunable to clarify the content of the summary in his OPM PSI, possibly because he could \nnot understand the questions about it; however, he insisted that he did not vote in the \nIraqi election. (Tr. 49) \n \nIn 2010 and 2014, Applicant worked as a volunteer while living in the United \nStates to help expatriate Iraqis living in the United States vote in Iraqi elections. (Tr. 31-\n32, 47) He was paid in 2014; however, he was unsure if he was paid in 2010 for this \nwork. (Tr. 31-32; 42-43) He did not say whether or not the Iraqi or U.S. government or \nsome other entity paid him in 2014. \n \nApplicant did not believe he continued to have Iraqi citizenship, and in any event, \nhe was willing to renounce his Iraqi citizenship. (Tr. 50)4 In 2012, he took the \nNaturalization Oath of Allegiance to the United States of America (AE H) which states: \n \nI hereby declare, on oath, that I absolutely and entirely renounce and \nabjure all allegiance and fidelity to any foreign prince, potentate, state, or \nsovereignty, of whom or which I have heretofore been a subject or citizen; \nthat I will support and defend the Constitution and laws of the United \nStates of America against all enemies, foreign and domestic; that I will \nbear true faith and allegiance to the same; that I will bear arms on behalf \nof the United States when required by the law; that I will perform \nnoncombatant service in the Armed Forces of the United States when \nrequired by the law; that I will perform work of national importance under \ncivilian direction when required by the law; and that I take this obligation \nfreely, without any mental reservation or purpose of evasion; so help me \nGod.5 \n                                            \n4 The Iraqi Council of the Presidency issued Article 10(I), which states, \u201cAn Iraqi who acquires a \nforeign nationality shall retain his Iraqi nationality, unless he has declared in writing renunciation of his \nIraqi nationality.\u201d Iraqi Official Gazette Issue 4019 dated March 7, 2006, No. 26, https://www.refworld.org/ \npdfid/4b1e364c2.pdf.  \n \n5 The language of the current Oath of Allegiance is found in the Code of Federal Regulations \nSection 337.1 and is closely based upon the statutory elements in Section 337(a) of the Immigration and \nNationality Act. U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1448, https://www.uscis.gov/us-\ncitizenship/naturalization-test/naturalization-oath-allegiance-united-states-america. \n\n \n5                                                                                                                                             \nCharacter Evidence \n \nApplicant serves as a linguist for the U.S. Army in Iraq. (Tr. 25) He goes on \npatrols outside his base with soldiers, and he wears a helmet and vest outside his base. \n(Tr. 25; AE I) He is not permitted to carry a weapon. (Tr. 26) He does not visit his family \nin Iraq. (Tr. 26) He is not authorized to leave the Army base or to have visitors at the \nArmy base. (Tr. 26) He provided photographs of Army personnel he served with in Iraq. \n(Tr. 32-36; AE I) He was present in camp when an Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIL) \nvehicle-borne improvised explosive device (IED) exploded and caused damage to his \ncamp. (Tr. 36-37; AE I) ISIL or some other terrorists fired at his patrol three times when \nhe was in Iraq; however, he was not injured. (Tr. 51) \n \nOn April 19, 2018, an Army colonel and Task Force commander, who served \nwith Applicant in Iraq from August 2017 to April 2018, wrote: \n \n[Applicant\u2019s] dedication, professionalism and positive demeanor positively \nimpacted the Task Force\u2019s ability to communicate, coordinate and execute \noperations in close partnership with Iraqi senior leaders. [Applicant] could \nalways be counted upon to assist with requirements, going above and \nbeyond to accomplish the mission. His superb knowledge of the language \nand culture directly impacted the unit\u2019s ability to achieve mission success \nand he was an indispensable member of the team. \n \n(AE B). A major who served with Applicant in 2017 lauded Applicant for his \nprofessionalism, diligence, and contributions to mission accomplishment. (AE B) In 2016, \nan Infantry lieutenant colonel commanding a battalion observed that Appellant \nenthusiastically volunteered to move with the unit into a more dangerous and \ninhospitable area of the conflict. (AE B) He too lauded Appellant\u2019s professionalism and \ncontributions to mission accomplishment. (AE B)   \n \n \nApplicant provided five certificates of appreciation from units in Iraq praising him \nfor his contributions to mission accomplishment. (AE C) They described his diligent, \nprofessional, and honorable service as a linguist. (AE C) \n \nIraq \n \nThe U.S. Mission in Iraq remains dedicated to building a strategic partnership with \nIraq and the Iraqi people. The December 2011 departure of U.S. troops from Iraq marked \na milestone in our relationship as Iraq continues to develop as a sovereign, stable, and \nself-reliant country. Iraq is now a key partner for the United States in the region as well \nas a voice of moderation and democracy in the Middle East. Iraq has functioning \ngovernment institutions including an active legislature, is playing an increasingly \nconstructive role in the region, and has a bright economic future as oil revenues surpass \npre-Saddam production levels with continued rapid growth to come. The United States \nmaintains vigorous and broad engagement with Iraq on diplomatic, political, economic, \nand security issues in accordance with the U.S.-Iraq Strategic Framework Agreement. \n \n\n \n6                                                                                                                                             \nThe Strategic Framework Agreement (SFA) between Iraq and the United States \nprovides the basis for the U.S.-Iraq bilateral relationship. It covers the range of bilateral \nissues including political relations and diplomacy, defense and security, trade and \nfinance, energy, judicial and law enforcement issues, services, science, culture, \neducation, and environment. Efforts to implement the SFA are overseen by the Higher \nCoordinating Committee and several Joint Coordination Committees, which meet \nperiodically. \n \nThe U.S. State Department warns that U.S. citizens in Iraq are at high risk for \nviolence and kidnapping, and advises U.S. citizens not to travel to Iraq. The current \ntravel advisory level is Level 4: Do not travel.  \n \nThe ability of the U.S. Embassy to provide consular services to U.S. citizens \noutside Baghdad is limited given the security environment. Anti-U.S. sectarian militias \nmay threaten U.S. citizens and western companies throughout Iraq. Kidnappings and \nattacks by IEDs occur in many areas of the country, including Baghdad. Methods of \nattack have included explosively formed penetrators (EFPs), magnetic IEDs placed on \nvehicles, human and vehicle-borne IEDs, mines placed on or concealed near roads, \nmortars and rockets, and shootings using various direct fire weapons. Such attacks may \ntake place in public venues such as cafes and markets.  \n \nIraq witnessed continued terrorist activity in 2016, primarily as a result of the \nactions of ISIL. In 2016, ISIL remained the greatest terrorist threat globally, maintaining a \nformidable force in Syria, including a large number of foreign terrorist fighters. ISIL\u2019s \ncapacity and territorial control in Iraq has dramatically eroded in the past two years. \nAccording to estimates from the UN Assistance Mission for Iraq, acts of terrorism and \nviolence killed more than 7,000 civilians and injured more than 12,000 in 2016. By the \nend of 2017, Iraqi Security Forces had liberated all territory from ISIL, drastically \nreducing ISIL\u2019s ability to commit abuses and atrocities. Human rights violations continue \nto be a problem with allegations of unlawful killings and other abuses being made \nagainst the Iraqi Security Forces and Popular Mobilization Forces.  \n \nIn its annual human rights report, the U.S. Department of State reported that \nsevere human rights problems were widespread. Sectarian hostility, widespread \ncorruption, and lack of transparency at all levels of government and society weakened \nthe government's authority and worsened effective human rights protections. Iraqi \nSecurity Forces, members of the Federal Police, and the Peshmerga committed some \nhuman rights violations, and there continued to be reports of Popular Mobilization Forces \nkilling, torturing, kidnapping, and extorting civilians. ISIL committed the overwhelming \nmajority of serious human rights abuses, including attacks against: civilians, (particularly \nShia but also Sunnis who opposed ISIL); members of other religious and ethnic \nminorities; women; and children. \n \nObservers also reported other significant human rights-related problems: harsh \nand life-threatening conditions in detention and prison facilities; arbitrary arrest and \nlengthy pretrial detention, denial of fair public trial; insufficient judicial institutional \ncapacity; ineffective implementation of civil judicial procedures and remedies; arbitrary \ninterference with privacy and homes; child soldiers; limits on freedom of expression, \n\n \n7                                                                                                                                             \nincluding press freedoms; violence against and harassment of journalists; undue \ncensorship; social, religious, and political restrictions in academic and cultural matters; \nlimits on freedoms of peaceful assembly and association; limits on religious freedom due \nto violence by extremist groups; restrictions on freedom of movement; refugee and \ninternally displaced persons (IDP) abuse; both forced IDP returns and preventing IDPs \nfrom returning home; discrimination against and societal abuse of women and ethnic, \nreligious, and racial minorities, including exclusion from decision-making roles; trafficking \nin persons; societal discrimination and violence against lesbian, gay, bisexual, \ntransgender, and intersex (LGBTI) persons; seizure of property without due process; and \nlimitations on worker rights. \n \nThe United States\u2019 extraordinary commitment to Iraq is balanced against the \ninherent dangers of the ongoing conflict in Iraq to its citizens and residents and the Iraqi \ngovernment\u2019s problems developing and complying with the rule of law. A top national \nsecurity goal of the United States is to establish relationships, cooperation, training, and \nsupport of the Iraqi Government and military in the ongoing war against terrorism. \n \nPolicies \n \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the \nExecutive Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security \nemphasizing, \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. \nEgan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the \nauthority to control access to information bearing on national security and to determine \nwhether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. \nat 527. The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended.    \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable.  \n \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nabout potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nClearance decisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be \na determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 7. \nSee also Exec. Or. 12968 (Aug. 2, 1995), \u00a7 3.1. Thus, nothing in this Decision should \nbe construed to suggest that I have based this decision, in whole or in part, on any \n\n \n8                                                                                                                                             \nexpress or implied determination about applicant\u2019s allegiance, loyalty, or patriotism. It is \nmerely an indication the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President,  \nSecretary of Defense, and DNI have established for issuing a clearance. \n \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in \nthe personal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant \nfrom being eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden \nof establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the \ncriteria listed therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 \nat 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).  \n     \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it \nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security \nclearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). The burden of \ndisproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. \n02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, \nif they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b).  \n \nAnalysis \n \n Foreign Influence \n \n  \nAG \u00b6 6 explains the security concern about \u201cforeign contacts and interests\u201d \nstating: \n \nForeign contacts and interests, including, but not limited to, business, \nfinancial, and property interests, are a national security concern if they \nresult in divided allegiance. They may also be a national security concern \nif they create circumstances in which the individual may be manipulated or \ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a \nway inconsistent with U.S. interests or otherwise made vulnerable to \npressure or coercion by any foreign interest. Assessment of foreign \ncontacts and interests should consider the country in which the foreign \ncontact or interest is located, including, but not limited to, considerations \nsuch as whether it is known to target U.S. citizens to obtain classified or \nsensitive information or is associated with a risk of terrorism. \n \nAG \u00b6 7 has three conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying in this case: \n \n(a) contact, regardless of method, with a foreign family member, business \nor professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or \n\n \n9                                                                                                                                             \nresident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of \nforeign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; \n \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual\u2019s obligation to \nprotect classified or sensitive information or technology and the \nindividual\u2019s desire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing \nthat information or technology; and \n(e) shared living quarters with a person or persons, regardless of \ncitizenship status, if that relationship creates a heightened risk of foreign \ninducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion. \nApplicant admitted that his father and sister are citizens and residents of \nKurdistan, a region of Iraq. One of his sisters is a citizen of Iraq residing in Germany.   \n \nApplicant does not have frequent or recent direct contact with his family living in \nIraq. Applicant, his spouse, and three children were born in Kurdistan, a region of Iraq. \nApplicant maintains his relationships with his father and sister in Iraq through his sister \nliving in Germany. He did not establish an absence of care and concern for relatives \nliving in Iraq.  \n \nWhen an allegation under a disqualifying condition is established, \u201cthe Directive \npresumes there is a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct or \ncircumstances . . . and an applicant\u2019s security [or trustworthiness] eligibility. Direct or \nobjective evidence of nexus is not required.\u201d ISCR Case No. 17-00507 at 2 (App. Bd. \nJune 13, 2018) (citing ISCR Case No. 15-08385 at 4 (App. Bd. May 23, 2018)). \n \nThere are widely documented safety issues for residents of Iraq primarily \nbecause of terrorists and insurgents. Applicant has voluntarily shared in those dangers \non behalf of the DOD, and he is willing to do so in the future. Numerous linguists, \nsupporting U.S. forces, have family living in Iraq. Hundreds of United States and \ncoalition armed forces and civilian contractors serving in Iraq are targets of terrorists, \nalong with Iraqi civilians and soldiers who support the Iraqi government and cooperate \nwith coalition forces.  \n \nThe mere possession of close family ties with relatives living in Iraq is not, as a \nmatter of law, disqualifying under Guideline B. However, if an applicant or his or her \nspouse has such a relationship with even one person living in a foreign country, this \nfactor alone is sufficient to create the potential for foreign influence and could potentially \nresult in the compromise of classified information. See ISCR Case No. 08-02864 at 4-5 \n(App. Bd. Dec. 29, 2009) (discussing problematic visits of applicant\u2019s father to Iran).  \n \nThere is a rebuttable presumption that a person has ties of affection for, or \nobligation to, his or her immediate family members, and this presumption includes in-\nlaws. ISCR Case No. 07-06030 at 3 (App. Bd. June 19, 2008); ISCR Case No. 05-\n00939 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 3, 2007) (citing ISCR Case No. 01-03120 at 4 (App. Bd. Feb. \n20, 2002).    \n\n \n10                                                                                                                                           \nThe DOHA Appeal Board has indicated for Guideline B cases, \u201cthe nature of the \nforeign government involved and the intelligence-gathering history of that government \nare among the important considerations that provide context for the other record \nevidence and must be brought to bear on the Judge\u2019s ultimate conclusions in the case. \nThe country\u2019s human rights record is another important consideration.\u201d ISCR Case No. \n16-02435 at 3 (May 15, 2018) (citing ISCR Case No. 15-00528 at 3 (App. Bd. Mar. 13, \n2017)). Another significant consideration is the nature of a nation\u2019s government\u2019s \nrelationship with the United States. These factors are relevant in assessing the \nlikelihood that an applicant\u2019s family members living in that country are vulnerable to \ngovernment coercion or inducement.  \n \nThe risk of coercion, persuasion, or duress is significantly greater if the foreign \ncountry has an authoritarian government, the government ignores the rule of law \nincluding widely accepted civil liberties, a family member is associated with or \ndependent upon the government, the government is engaged in a counterinsurgency, \nterrorists cause a substantial amount of death or property damage, or the country is \nknown to conduct intelligence collection operations against the United States. The \nrelationship of Iraq with the United States, and the situation in that country places a \nsignificant burden of persuasion on Applicant to demonstrate that his relationship with \nany family member living in or visiting that country does not pose a trustworthiness or \nsecurity risk. Applicant should not be placed into a position where he might be forced to \nchoose between loyalty to the United States and a desire to assist a relative living in or \nvisiting Iraq.6  \n \nGuideline B security concerns are not limited to countries hostile to the United \nStates. \u201cThe United States has a compelling interest in protecting and safeguarding \nclassified information from any person, organization, or country that is not authorized to \nhave access to it, regardless of whether that person, organization, or country has \ninterests inimical to those of the United States.\u201d ISCR Case No. 02-11570 at 5 (App. Bd. \nMay 19, 2004). Furthermore, friendly nations can have profound disagreements with the \nUnited States over matters they view as important to their vital interests or national \nsecurity. Finally, we know friendly nations have engaged in espionage against the \nUnited States, especially in the economic, scientific, and technical fields. See ISCR \nCase No. 02-22461, 2005 DOHA LEXIS 1570 at *11-*12 (App. Bd. Oct. 27, 2005) (citing \nISCR Case No. 02-26976 at 5-6 (App. Bd. Oct. 22, 2004)) (discussing Taiwan). \n                                            \n6 The Appeal Board in ISCR Case No. 03-24933, 2005 DOHA LEXIS 346 at *20-*21 n. 18 (App. \nBd. 2005), explained how relatives in a foreign country have a security significance: \n \nThe issue under Guideline B is not whether an applicant\u2019s immediate family members in \na foreign country are of interest to a foreign power based on their prominence or personal \nsituation. Rather, the issue is whether an applicant\u2019s ties and contacts with immediate \nfamily members in a foreign country raise security [or trustworthiness] concerns because \nthose ties and contacts create a potential vulnerability that a foreign power could seek to \nexploit in an effort to get unauthorized access to U.S. classified information that an \napplicant -- not the applicant\u2019s immediate family members -- has by virtue of a security \nclearance [or public trust position]. A person may be vulnerable to influence or pressure \nexerted on, or through, the person\u2019s immediate family members -- regardless of whether \nthe person\u2019s family members are prominent or not. \n\n \n11                                                                                                                                           \nWhile there is no evidence that intelligence operatives, criminals, or terrorists \nfrom or in Iraq seek or have sought classified or economic information from or through \nApplicant or his family, nevertheless, it is not prudent to rule out such a possibility in the \nfuture. International terrorist groups are known to conduct intelligence activities as \neffectively as capable state intelligence services, and Iraq has a significant problem with \nterrorism. Applicant\u2019s family in Iraq \u201ccould be a means through which Applicant comes \nto the attention of those who seek U.S. information or technology and who would \nattempt to exert coercion upon him.\u201d ADP Case No. 14-01655 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 9, \n2015) (citing ISCR Case No. 14-02950 at 3 (App. Bd. May 14, 2015)).  \nApplicant\u2019s relationships with relatives who are living in Iraq or visiting that \ncountry create a potential conflict of interest because terrorists could place pressure on \nhis family in Iraq in an effort to cause Applicant to compromise classified information. \nThese relationships create \u201ca heightened risk of foreign inducement, manipulation, \npressure, or coercion\u201d under AG \u00b6 7. Department Counsel produced substantial \nevidence of Applicant\u2019s relationships with family in Iraq and has raised the issue of \npotential foreign pressure or attempted exploitation. AG \u00b6\u00b6 7(a), 7(b), and 7(e) apply, \nand further inquiry is necessary about potential application of any mitigating conditions.  \n \nAG \u00b6 8 lists six conditions that could mitigate foreign influence security concerns \nincluding: \n \n(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in which \nthese persons are located, or the positions or activities of those persons in \nthat country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be placed in a \nposition of having to choose between the interests of a foreign individual, \ngroup, organization, or government and the interests of the United States; \n \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of \nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, or allegiance to the group, \ngovernment, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such deep and \nlongstanding relationships and loyalties in the United States, that the \nindividual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the \nU.S. interest; \n \n(c) contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and \ninfrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign \ninfluence or exploitation; \n \n(d) the foreign contacts and activities are on U.S. Government business or \nare approved by the agency head or designee; \n \n(e) the individual has promptly complied with existing agency requirements \nregarding the reporting of contacts, requests, or threats from persons, \ngroups, or organizations from a foreign country; and \n \n\n \n12                                                                                                                                           \n(f) the value or routine nature of the foreign business, financial, or property \ninterests is such that they are unlikely to result in a conflict and could not \nbe used effectively to influence, manipulate, or pressure the individual. \n \nThe DOHA Appeal Board concisely explained Applicant\u2019s responsibility for \nproving the applicability of mitigating conditions as follows:  \n \nOnce a concern arises regarding an Applicant\u2019s security clearance \neligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance of \na security clearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th \nCir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991). After the Government \npresents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the \napplicant to rebut or mitigate those concerns. See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. The \nstandard applicable in security clearance decisions is that articulated in \nEgan, supra. \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access \nto classified information will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nDirective, Enclosure 2 \u00b6 2(b).  \n \nISCR Case No. 10-04641 at 4 (App. Bd. Sept. 24, 2013).  \n  \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 8(b) and 8(c) apply. Applicant has \u201cdeep and longstanding relationships \nand loyalties in the U.S.\u201d Applicant has resided in the United States since 2006, except \nwhen he was in Iraq.7 Applicant, his spouse, and his three children are citizens and \nresidents of the United States. He and his spouse swore an oath of allegiance to the \nUnited States as part of the citizenship process. He has property in the United States \nincluding a home and a substantial bank account. Most importantly, he served as a \nlinguist in Iraq supporting U.S. goals in that country.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s support to the DOD in Iraq as a linguist and cultural advisor, including \nthe dangers that service entailed, weigh towards mitigating security concerns. Applicant \nseeks a security clearance to enable him to continue serving in Iraq, providing critical \nassistance to U.S. Armed Forces in a dangerous combat environment. He has offered \nto continue to risk his life to support the United States\u2019 goals in Iraq. He has shown his \n                                            \n7 ISCR Case No. 17-00629 (App. Bd. May 24, 2018) the Appeal Board discussed a translator\u2019s \nmultiple tours on behalf of the United States in Iraq, limited time as a resident in the United States, and \nconnections to family living in Iraq. The Appeal Board stated: \n     \nIn general, an applicant\u2019s deployment to a combat zone in support of U.S. forces is not a \nfactor that weighs against his or her national security eligibility. On the contrary, such \ndeployments tend to establish various mitigating conditions such as [Directive] \u00b6 8(b) \n(\u201cthere is no conflict of interest . . . because . . . the individual has such deep and \nlongstanding loyalties in the United States, that the individual can be expected to resolve \nany conflict of interest in favor of the U.S. interest\u201d); [Directive] \u00b6 8(d) (\u201cthe foreign . . . \nactivities are on U.S. Government business\u201d); and [Directive] \u00b6 8(f) (\u201cthe value or routine \nnature of the foreign business . . . is such that [it is] unlikely to result in a conflict of \ninterest and could not be used effectively to influence, manipulate, or pressure the \nindividual.\u201d) \n \nId. at 3 (internal footnotes omitted) (remanding administrative judge\u2019s denial of security clearance). \n\n \n13                                                                                                                                           \npatriotism, loyalty, and fidelity to the United States during his support to DOD while \nserving in Iraq.  \n \nIn ISCR Case No. 17-00629 at 4 (App. Bd. May 24, 2018), the Appeal Board \ncogently explained the relevance of such service on behalf of the United States: \n \nSuch evidence demonstrates that Applicant has repeatedly been willing to \nassume a high level of risk on behalf of the U.S. and shows his ties and \nsense of obligation to the U.S. could be sufficiently strong enough to \nsupport a favorable application of mitigating condition 8(b). See ISCR \nCase No. 05-03846 at 6 (App. Bd. Nov 14, 2006) (An applicant\u2019s work in \nsupport of U.S. forces in Afghanistan occurred \u201cin the context of \ndangerous high-risk circumstances in which [he] made a significant \ncontribution to national security.\u201d) See also ISCR Case No. 04-12363 at 2 \n(App. Bd. Jul. 14, 2006); ISCR Case No. 07-00034 at 2-3 (App. Bd. Feb. \n5, 2008); and ISCR Case No. 10-02803 at 6 (App. Bd. Mar. 19, 2012).  \n \nApplicant\u2019s connections to Iraq are limited as the only family members living in \nKurdistan, a region of Iraq are his sister and father. He does not have direct contact with \nhis family in Iraq. His travel to Iraq after 2012 was on behalf of the U.S. Government \nand not for personal reasons. He does not have property in Iraq. \n \nApplicant\u2019s relationship with the United States must be weighed against the \npotential conflict of interest created by his relationships with relatives who are citizens \nand residents of Iraq. His father and sister reside in Kurdistan, a region of Iraq. Like \nevery other resident of Iraq, they are at risk from criminals, terrorists, and human rights \nviolations of the Iraqi government. \n \nIt is important to be mindful of the United States\u2019 huge historical investment of \nmanpower and money in Iraq, and Applicant has supported U.S. goals and objectives in \nIraq. Applicant and his family living in Iraq are potential targets of terrorists, and \nApplicant\u2019s potential access to classified information could theoretically add risk to his \nrelatives living in that country from lawless elements in Iraq.   \n \nIn sum, Applicant\u2019s connections to his relatives living in Iraq continue but are \nattenuated as they are through his sister living in Germany. His connections to the \nUnited States taken together, including his support of U.S. goals in a combat \nenvironment, are sufficient to overcome the foreign influence security concerns under \nGuideline B.  \n \nForeign Preference \n \nAG \u00b6 9 articulates the security concern for foreign preference: \n \nWhen an individual acts in such a way as to indicate a preference for a \nforeign country over the United States, then he or she may provide \ninformation or make decisions that are harmful to the interests of the \nUnited States. Foreign involvement raises concerns about an individual's \n\n \n14                                                                                                                                           \njudgment, reliability, and trustworthiness when it is in conflict with U.S. \nnational interests or when the individual acts to conceal it. By itself; the \nfact that a U.S. citizen is also a citizen of another country is not \ndisqualifying without an objective showing of such conflict or attempt at \nconcealment. The same is true for a U.S. citizen's exercise of any right or \nprivilege of foreign citizenship and any action to acquire or obtain \nrecognition of a foreign citizenship. \n \nAG \u00b6 10 lists six foreign preference conditions that could raise a security concern \nand may be disqualifying in this case including: \n \n(a) applying for and/or acquiring citizenship in any other country; \n \n(b) failure to report, or fully disclose when required, to an appropriate \nsecurity official, the possession of a passport or identity card issued by \nany country other than the United States; \n \n(c) failure to use a U.S. passport when entering or exiting the U.S.; \n \n(d) participation in foreign activities, including but not limited to: \n \n(1) assuming or attempting to assume any type of employment, \nposition, or political office in a foreign government or military organization; \nand \n \n \n(2) otherwise acting to serve the interests of a foreign person, group, \norganization, or government in any way that conflicts with U.S. national \nsecurity interests; \n \n(e) using foreign citizenship to protect financial or business interests in \nanother country in violation of U.S. law; and \n \n(f) an act of expatriation from the United States such as declaration of \nintent to renounce U.S. citizenship, whether through words or actions.  \n \n \nIn July 2012, Applicant was naturalized as a U.S. citizen. He erroneously stated \nthat he voted in an Iraqi election in 2014.8 Applicant credibly stated that he did not vote \nin the Iraqi election. His statement to the OPM investigator and his response to the SOR \nabout voting in the Iraqi election were caused by Applicant\u2019s misunderstanding of and \n                                            \n8 When the SOR was written, the previous version of the Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) (Aug. 30, \n2006) was in effect, and AG \u00b6 10(a)(7) stated, \u201c(7) voting in a foreign election\u201d was a disqualifying \ncondition. The Department of Defense eliminated that disqualifying condition and did not replace it with a \nsimilar specific disqualifying security concern relating to voting. Currently, voting in a foreign election does \nnot, in and of itself, raise a security concern. See Rumsfeld v. Forum for Acad. & Institutional Rights, Inc., \n547 U.S. 47, 57-58 (2006) (\u201cWe refuse to interpret the Solomon Amendment in a way that negates its \nrecent revision, and indeed would render it a largely meaningless exercise.\u201d); Stone v. INS, 514 U.S. 386, \n397 (1995). Voting in an Iraqi election by itself does not necessarily \u201cconflict[] with U.S. national security \ninterests.\u201d \n\n \n15                                                                                                                                           \nconfusion about the English language. He did not intend to mislead security officials \nabout his connections and preferences concerning Iraq.    \n \nIn April 2014, Applicant assisted Iraqis citizens living in the United States for \nabout three days who were interested in voting in an Iraqi election. It is unclear what \nentity funded this employment. It might have been funded by the Iraqi Government. \nApplicant\u2019s involvement in the Iraqi election while living in the United States shows \nenough of a preference or interest in Iraqi politics to raise a foreign preference security \nconcern. See AG \u00b6 10(d). \n \nOne foreign preference mitigating condition under AG \u00b6 11 applies in this case, \n\u201c(c) the individual has expressed a willingness to renounce the foreign citizenship that is \nin conflict with U.S. national security interests.\u201d Applicant stated that he is willing to or \nhas renounced his Iraqi citizenship. Foreign preference security concerns are mitigated. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n     \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), \u201c[t]he ultimate determination\u201d of whether to grant a security \nclearance \u201cmust be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines\u201d and the whole-person concept. My comments under \nGuidelines B and C are incorporated in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors \nin AG \u00b6 2(d) were addressed under those guidelines but some warrant additional \ncomment. \n \nApplicant is a 56-year-old linguist, and DOD contractors have employed him \nsince April 2015 in Iraq. Shortly after his hearing, he returned to Iraq to continue his \nlinguist duties. His annual salary as a linguist is $80,000. In 2006, he and his family \nmoved to the United States. In 2012, he and his spouse became U.S. citizens, and they \ntook the oath of allegiance to the United States. His employment and assets are located \nin the United States.  \n \n\n \n16                                                                                                                                           \nA Guideline B decision concerning Iraq must take into consideration the \ngeopolitical situation and dangers there.9 Iraq is a dangerous place because of violence \nfrom terrorists, and the Iraqi government does not respect the full spectrum of human \nrights. Terrorists continue to threaten the Iraqi government, the interests of the United \nStates, U.S. Armed Forces, and those who cooperate and assist the United States. The \nUnited States and Iraqi governments are allies in the war on terrorism. \n \nApplicant has indirect contact through his sister in Germany with his father and \nsister in Iraq. Contacts with family in foreign countries are a manifestation of one\u2019s care \nand concern for relatives living in those foreign countries. His relationships with \nresidents of Iraq raise important foreign influence security concerns. In 2014, he worked \nfor three days to help Iraqi citizens vote in an Iraqi election, raising an important foreign \npreference security concern. The foreign preference security concern is mitigated by his \noffer to renounce his Iraqi citizenship and his oath of allegiance to the United States. \n \nApplicant served as a linguist, translator, or cultural advisor in Iraq. He made \ncontributions at personal risk on behalf of U.S. combat forces in Iraq. All these \ncircumstances increase the probability that Applicant will recognize, resist, and report \nany attempts by a foreign power, terrorist group, or insurgent group to coerce or exploit \nhim. See ISCR Case No. 07-00034 at 2 (App. Bd. Feb. 5, 2008). One colonel, one \nlieutenant colonel, and one major wrote letters lauding his professionalism, diligence, \nand honorable service to the United States in a combat zone. His base was bombed, \nand his patrol was fired upon three times. He received five certificates of appreciation \nfrom units in Iraq praising him for his contributions to mission accomplishment.

Ranish, Esq.  \n04/20/2018\n______________ \nDecision \n______________ \nKATAUSKAS, Philip J., Administrative Judge: \nApplicant contests the Defense Department\u2019s intent to revoke his eligibility for \naccess to classified information. He failed to present sufficient evidence to explain, \nextenuate, or mitigate the security concern stemming from his history failing to file income \ntax returns. Accordingly, this case is decided against Applicant.  \nStatement of the Case \nOn December 19, 2016, the Department of Defense (DOD) Consolidated \nAdjudications Facility (CAF) sent Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) alleging that \nhis circumstances raised security concerns under the financial considerations   guideline.1 \nApplicant answered the SOR on January 12, 2017, and requested a hearing to establish \nhis eligibility for continued access to classified information. \nOn March 26, 2018, a date mutually agreed to by the parties, a hearing was held. \nApplicant testified at the hearing. The Government offered two exhibits, which were \n1 The DOD CAF took this action under Executive Order (E.O.) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information \nwithin Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense \nIndustrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive).  \n\n2 \n \nmarked for identification as GE 1 and 2 and were admitted without objection. Applicant\u2019s \nExhibits (AE) A and B were admitted without objection. The transcript of the hearing (Tr.) \nwas received on April 4, 2018. \n \nProcedural Issues \n \n \nOn December 10, 2016, the Security Executive Agent issued Directive 4 (SEAD-\n4), establishing a \u201csingle, common adjudicative criteria for all covered individuals who \nrequire initial or continued eligibility for access to classified information or eligibility to hold \na sensitive position.\u201d2 The National Security Adjudicative Guidelines (hereinafter \u201cnew \nadjudicative guidelines\u201d or \u201cAG\u201d), which are found in Appendix A to SEAD-4, are to be \nused in all security clearance cases decisions issued on or after June 8, 2017.3 In light of \nthis explicit direction (and absent lawful authority to the contrary), I have applied the new \nadjudicative guidelines. ISCR Case No. 02-00305 at 3 (App. Bd. Feb. 12, 2003) (security \nclearance decisions must be based on current DoD policy and standards).4 DOD CAF \nadjudicators reviewed this case using the previous version of the adjudicative guidelines, \ndated September 1, 2006, which were in effect at the time. My decision and formal \nfindings under the revised Guideline F would not be different under the 2006 Guideline F.  \n \nAt the hearing, Department Counsel moved to amend the SOR to delete the \nallegations of failure to timely file federal and state returns from 2006 to 2015, so that the \nSOR would allege only that Applicant failed to timely file federal and state returns from \n2010 to 2015. Applicant\u2019s counsel did not object, and I granted the motion to amend.5 \n \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant is 38 years old, a college graduate, unmarried, and with no children. \nSince March 2010, he has worked for a defense contractor.6 \n \nThe SOR alleges that Applicant failed to timely file his federal and state income \ntax returns for the tax years 2006 through 2015.7 Applicant answered that he filed his \n                                                          \n2 SEAD-4, \u00b6 B, Purpose.  \n \n3 SEAD-4, \u00b6 C, Applicability.  \n \n4 See also ISCR Case No. 07-00029 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 7, 2007) (when the guidelines were last revised, \nthe Board stated: \u201cQuasi-judicial adjudications must be made within the bounds of applicable law and \nagency policy, not without regard to them.\u201d) \n \n5 Tr. 7.  \n \n6 GE 1.  \n \n7 SOR \u00b6 1. \n \n\n3 \n \nfederal and state income taxes for 2006 through 2009 on time. Applicant admitted with \nexplanations that he did not timely file his federal and state for 2010 through 2015.8  \n \nApplicant testified that in September 2016 he suffered a life-threatening medical \ncondition and had to be resuscitated. The experience made him appreciate his family and \nhis friends at work. He did not, however, attribute that experience or any other medical \nreasons or other explanations for failing to timely file his 2010 to 2015 tax returns.9 \n \nInstead, Applicant blamed those failures to file timely on his opening of an online \ninvestment account in about 2009 or 2010. He was trying to buy some stock online. \nApplicant got locked out of his account and was told by the investment firm that he needed \nto verify his identity. So, he went to his credit union, which gave him a notarized document \nbut said it would not prove to the investment account that he was who he claimed to be. \nThe investment account told him he needed to go to a lawyer. At about this time, he \nwanted to prepare his tax returns and tried to log in to his investment account to get the \nproper forms for the IRS and state taxing authorities. Since taxes were routinely withheld \nfrom his paychecks, he did not anticipate owing any taxes. He did not believe, however, \nthat he could file his returns without having the forms from the investment account. And \nhe was not able to access those forms.10 \n \nApplicant testified about his background interview with the OPM investigator in \nApril 2016. Applicant discussed his tax filing problem, and the investigator asked if \nApplicant had funded the investment account.  Applicant said he had not, and he was told \nby the investigator that in that event, he did not need any forms from the investment \naccount to file his tax returns. Applicant did not realize that, and within a few months of \nthat interview, he had filed all late returns. He owed less than $1,000 in taxes.11 \n \nOn cross-examination, Applicant was asked that since he was an IT specialist, why \ncould he not access his investment account? He answered that because he was not an \nIT administrator for that account; only the investment firm\u2019s IT administrators could access \nhis account. Applicant was asked whether he sought help from a tax professional or a tax \npreparer. He answered that he did not, even though he knew his tax returns were due on \nApril 15 each year. He also said that lack of finances did not prevent him from seeking \nprofessional help with his taxes. Before opening the investment account, Applicant had \nalways timely filed his tax returns since 1998.12 \n                                                          \n8 Answer. \n \n9 Tr. 12, 31.  \n \n10 Tr. 13-15.  \n \n11 Tr. 15-18. Applicant also testified than he attended a FDIC Lending Smart Course regarding finances \nand taxes, and that going forward, will file all his tax returns on time. Id. 18. The record does not show \nwhen Applicant attended the FDIC course, before or after he filed his late returns. The most credible \ninference is that Applicant attended this course sometime after his OPM interview.  \n  \n12 Tr. 24-26, 30-31.  \n \n\n4 \n \n \nApplicant was examined on why he failed to disclose on his security clearance \napplication in June 2016 that he had unfiled tax returns.13 He said that he was under \nstress from filling out the security clearance application and from the job-related stress of \nproviding IT support for over 200 individuals in his department.14  \n \nApplicant\u2019s attention was called to the summary report of his background interview \nin April 2016 when he told the investigator that he had been \u201clazy\u201d and could not get the \ntax documents from his investment account.15 Applicant testified that he did not like the \nword \u201clazy,\u201d that he was tired \u201cafter work,\u201d with a work day from 4:00 AM until after 5:00 \nPM (including commute).16  \n \nLaw and Policies \n \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). Individuals are eligible for access to classified information \n\u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with the national interest\u201d to authorize \nsuch access. E.O. 10865 \u00a7 2; SEAD-4, \u00b6 E.4. \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance, an administrative \njudge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief introductory \nexplanations, the guidelines list potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions. The \nguidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human \nbehavior, an administrative judge applies the guidelines in a  commonsense manner, \nconsidering all available and reliable information, in arriving at a fair and impartial \ndecision. SEAD-4, Appendix A, \u00b6\u00b6 2(c), 2(d). \n \nDepartment Counsel must present evidence to establish controverted facts alleged \nin the SOR. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14.

ISCR Case No. 12-01266 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 4, 2014). \n                                                          \n \n \n13 Counsel for Applicant objected to this questioning, because it was not alleged in the SOR. I overruled \nthat objection, on the grounds that it went to the whole-person concept and to Applicant\u2019s credibility. Tr. \n28. Even though not alleged in the SOR, such matters may be considered on the issue of Applicant\u2019s \ncredibility. See ISCR Case No. 08-09232 at 3 (Sep. 9, 2010).  \n \n14 Tr. 33-34.  \n \n15 GE 2.  \n \n16 Tr. 34-35.  \n\n5 \n \nIn resolving the ultimate question regarding an applicant\u2019s eligibility, \u201c[a]ny doubt \nconcerning personnel being considered for national security eligibility will be resolved in \nfavor of the national security.\u201d SEAD-4, Appendix A, \u00b6 2(b). See also SEAD-4, \u00b6 E.4. \nMoreover, the Supreme Court has held that officials making \u201csecurity clearance \ndeterminations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours. The Government reposes a high degree of trust and \nconfidence in individuals to whom it grants access to classified information. Decisions \ninclude, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk an applicant may deliberately or \ninadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain \ndegree of legally permissible extrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of \ncompromise of classified information. \n \nDiscussion \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \n \nThe SOR alleges that Applicant has a number of delinquent debts, which \npurportedly raise a security concern under Guideline F. The financial considerations \nsecurity concern is explained at AG \u00b6 18, which in pertinent part, states: \n  \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence.  \n \n Guideline F is not limited to a consideration of whether a person with financial \nissues might be tempted to compromise classified information or engage in other illegality \nto pay their debts. It also addresses the extent to which the circumstances giving rise to \ndelinquent debt and other security-significant financial issues cast doubt upon a person\u2019s \nself-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting classified information.17 \n \n \nIn assessing Applicant\u2019s case, I considered the following potentially disqualifying \nand mitigating conditions: \n \nAG \u00b6 19(f):   failure to file\u2026annual Federal, state, or local income tax returns \n. . . as required; \n \n                                                          \n17 ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May. 1, 2012).  \n \n\n6 \n \nAG \u00b6 20(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not \ncast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \nAG \u00b6 20(b): the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were \nlargely beyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \nAG \u00b6 20(c):  the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling \nfor the problem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit \ncredit counseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem \nis being resolved or is under control; and  \n \nAG \u00b6 20(g):    the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax \nauthority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \n \nA security clearance adjudication is not a debt collection or tax enforcement \nprocess. Rather, an administrative judge examines the way an applicant handles   \npersonal financial obligations to assess how they may handle their security obligations.18 \n\u201cFailure to file tax returns suggests that an applicant has a problem with complying with \nwell-established government rules and systems.\u201d19 Here, Applicant\u2019s security clearance \neligibility was called into question by his history of failing to timely file his income tax \nreturns. I conclude that disqualifying condition AG \u00b6 19(f) applies. The next inquiry is \nwhether any mitigating conditions apply. \n \nApplicant\u2019s failure to file began with his obligation to file his 2010 tax returns in \n2011. That failure continued annually until after his background interview in April 2016, \nwhen he was told that he did not need any investment account forms to file his returns. \nApplicant\u2019s conduct was not infrequent, nor did it occur that long ago. Therefore, AG \u00b6 \n20(a) does not apply. \n \n Applicant claimed that he failed to file, because he could not access his \ninvestment account for forms he believed necessary to file his returns. Even if I credit that \nas a circumstance largely beyond his control, the next inquiry is whether Applicant acted \nresponsibly under those circumstances.20 Confronted with this problem, however, he did \nnothing further to solve it. He did not seek professional help from a tax preparer or a tax \n                                                          \n18 See generally ISCR Case No. ISCR Case No. 12-09719 at 2-3 (App. Bd. Apr. 6, 2016). \n \n19 ISCR Case No. 01-05340 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 20, 2002).  \n \n20 That Applicant may have been \u201ctired after work\u201d is not a circumstance largely beyond his control.  Millions \nof taxpayers, many of whom may also be tired after work, are expected to comply with their annual income \ntax obligations. This is especially true of individuals who seek access to classified information.  \n\n7 \n \nadvisor. And Applicant admitted that his financial situation did not prevent him from \nseeking such assistance. Applicant knew that his tax returns were due on April 15 of each \nyear. He simply let each tax filing deadline go by, until he completed his security clearance \napplication and was interviewed by an OPM investigator. This is not responsible conduct. \nTherefore, AG \u00b6 20(b) does not apply.  \n \nApplicant attended an FDIC Lending Smart Course regarding finances and taxes. \nOn this record it appears, however, that he did so after his background interview. \nNonetheless, I give him partial, but not complete, mitigation under AG \u00b6 20(c). \n \nThe record shows that once Applicant was alerted by the OPM investigator that he \ncould file his back returns, Applicant did so, and that he owed less than $1,000 in back \ntaxes. Even if I credit Applicant with bringing his tax obligations up to date under AG \u00b6 \n20(g), his history of late filing of federal and state income tax returns is not fully mitigated. \nApplicant \u201cdid not demonstrate the high degree of good judgment and reliability required \nof persons granted access to classified information.\u201d21 \n \nThe record raises doubts about Applicant\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, good \njudgment, and ability to protect classified information. In reaching this conclusion, I \nweighed the evidence as a whole and considered if the favorable evidence outweighed \nthe unfavorable evidence or vice versa. I also gave due consideration to the whole-person \nconcept.22 Accordingly, I conclude that Applicant did not meet his ultimate burden of \npersuasion to show that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant him \neligibility for access to classified information. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F (Financial Considerations):      Against Applicant \n \n \n     Subparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.b: \n \n \n \n    Against Applicant \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                          \n21 ISCR Case No. 12-05053 at 4 (App. Bd.

Crowley, Esq., Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro se \n______________ \nDecision \n______________ \nGARCIA, Candace Le\u2019i, Administrative Judge: \nApplicant has not mitigated the criminal conduct, personal conduct, and financial \nconsiderations security concerns. Eligibility for access to classified information is \ndenied.  \nStatement of the Case \nOn May 18, 2017, the Department of Defense (DOD) issued a Statement of \nReasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing security concerns under Guideline J (criminal \nconduct) and Guideline E (personal conduct). The action was taken under Executive \nOrder (Exec. Or.) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February \n20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security \nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the \nadjudicative guidelines (AG).1 \n1 I considered this case under the AG implemented by DOD on June 8, 2017. I also considered it under \nthe previous AG implemented on September 1, 2006, and my conclusions are the same using either set \nof AG. \n04/11/2019\n\n \n2 \n \nApplicant responded to the SOR on May 31, 2017, and requested a hearing \nbefore an administrative judge. The case was assigned to me on January 17, 2018. The \ncase was closed due to loss of jurisdiction on January 23, 2018, as Applicant was \nseparated by his sponsor employer, a DOD contractor, in August 2017. The case was \nreopened and assigned to me on October 22, 2018, when Applicant was re-sponsored \nby another DOD contractor.  \n \nOn November 2, 2018, the Government amended the SOR pursuant to \u00b6 E3.1.17 \nof the Directive, to add allegations under Guideline F (financial considerations), \nnumbered \u00b6\u00b6 3.a-3.m. Applicant responded to the amended SOR on November 9, \n2018. The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a notice of hearing \n(NOH) on November 13, 2018, scheduling the hearing for November 27, 2018. \nApplicant waived the 15-day notice requirement. I convened the hearing as scheduled.  \n \nGovernment Exhibits (GE) 1 and 3 through 13 were admitted in evidence without \nobjection. I sustained Applicant\u2019s objection to the admission of GE 2, consisting of \nunauthenticated reports of investigation for background interviews conducted on \nFebruary 18 and March 24, 2016, and it was not admitted in evidence. Applicant \ntestified and submitted Applicant Exhibits (AE) A through F, which I admitted in \nevidence without objection. At Applicant\u2019s request, I kept the record open until January \n4, 2019, for additional evidence. By that date, Applicant submitted additional \ndocumentation, which I marked collectively as AE G and admitted in evidence without \nobjection. DOHA received the hearing transcript (Tr.) on December 6, 2018.2                                        \n  \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant admitted the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b, 1.d-1.f, 3.a-3.m, and he denied \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.c, and 2.a. He is 29 years old, single, and he has one child, a minor.3 \n \n \nApplicant graduated from high school in 2007. He earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in \n2011 and a master\u2019s degree in 2015. As of the date of the hearing, he was enrolling to \nearn a second master\u2019s degree. He worked for previous DOD contractors from \napproximately 2015 to 2017. He received an offer of employment from a DOD \ncontractor in September 2018, contingent on obtaining a security clearance. He has \nnever held a clearance, and his interim clearance from November 2016 was suspended \nafter the issuance of the SOR.4  \n \n \nIn September 2012, Applicant was charged with driving with a suspended \nlicense; he denied that he was arrested (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 2.a). He was pulled over by a \npolice officer for driving with a suspended license, which stemmed from an unpaid \ntraffic-related ticket. As instructed by the officer, he left his car parked and a friend \n                                                     \n2 Tr. at 21-22, 27-31, 114-116. \n \n3 Applicant\u2019s response to the SOR; Tr. at 8, 15, 37, 61-62, 107-110; GE 1. \n \n4 Tr. at 8-12, 44, 50, 72-78, 104-107; GE 1; AE B. \n\n \n3 \n \npicked him up. He immediately called the state motor vehicle administration, paid the \n$100 ticket, and returned to retrieve his car the next day.5  \n \n \nIn May 2014, Applicant was charged with negligent driving in a careless and \nimprudent manner, endangering property, life, and person, and driving under the \ninfluence (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b, 1.c, 2.a). He was on a date with his child\u2019s mother at a sushi \nrestaurant. He drank sake for the first time. He did not feel intoxicated so he drove \nhome. As he approached his home, the road that he lived on was flooded. He \nunknowingly drove his car on top of a submerged tree, then called the police for \nassistance. The responding officer asked him if he had been drinking, and he said \u201cYes\u201d \nand disclosed that he had consumed a \u201ccouple of sak[e]s.\u201d The officer looked into his \neyes with a flashlight and administered a walk-and-turn sobriety test. The officer then \nplaced him in the front seat of the officer\u2019s car, without handcuffs, and drove him to the \nprecinct. There, he was administered a breathalyzer test and tested under the legal \nlimit. He received 18 months of probation before judgment, a $140 fine, and he was \nordered to attend alcohol-education counseling. He completed probation, paid the fine, \nand attended alcohol counseling; he did not receive an alcohol-related diagnosis. (SOR \n\u00b6\u00b6 1.c, 2.a).6 \n \n \nIn July 2015, Applicant was charged with second-degree assault (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d, \n2.a). This was his first domestic-violence-related charge. He was living with his child\u2019s \nmother and they got into a verbal argument. She called the police and reported that he \nhit her on her leg, which he denied. The case was placed on a stet docket. In August \n2015, the case was taken out of the stet docket when he was again charged with \nsecond-degree assault (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.e, 2.a). He testified that he and his child\u2019s mother got \ninto another argument, after she hit him on his head with a remote. He denied hitting \nher. He stated that \u201cShe was coming at me in an aggressive way,\u201d so he threw her \npurse at her, and the buckle of the purse scratched her forehead and caused her to \nbleed. When the police arrived, they immediately arrested him upon seeing the blood on \nher forehead. At trial, his child\u2019s mother admitted that she lied about the July incident \nand he was consequently found not guilty of that charge. He received 24 months of \nprobation before judgment for the August charge, and he was ordered to attend \ndomestic-violence counseling. He completed counseling in 2016 and probation in 2017. \nHe has since returned to the counseling program on invitation to share his experiences \nwith other attendees.7 \n \n \nIn June 2018, Applicant was charged with second-degree assault for the third \ntime (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.f, 2.a). He testified that he told his child\u2019s mother that he no longer \nwanted her living with him. He then went to his weekly church group and returned to a \nvandalized home. He told her to take what she wanted but leave their son with him, \nsince he was the sole breadwinner. He grabbed her keys and got into a tug-of-war with \nher over her cell phone, which he wanted to keep because he paid for it. When he let go \n                                                     \n5 Tr. at 35-37; GE 4. \n \n6 Tr. at 37-43, 53-56; GE 1, 3, 5-8. \n \n7 Tr. at 43-56, 64-65; GE 1, 3, 9, 10. \n\n \n4 \n \nof the phone, he fell backwards onto the floor, and as he was standing up, she said \u201cyou \njust hit me, I\u2019m calling the police.\u201d He gathered his belongings and went to a friend\u2019s \nhouse to spend the night. In the morning, he reported to the police station to try to \nprovide his statement to any report that she might have filed the previous night. He was \ngiven the name and number of the reporting officer, because the officer was not at the \nstation, and he left the officer a voicemail. He returned to the station when the officer did \nnot return his call, and another officer was sent to his home later that day. That officer \ntold him that there was no police report filed and he was not charged. He was thus \nsurprised when he received a court summons reflecting that he had, in fact, been \ncharged with second-degree assault. His child\u2019s mother claimed in a police report that \nhe hit her and placed her in a headlock. He hired an attorney and intends to fight the \ncharge. The case was scheduled for a pre-trial hearing in December 2018.8 \n \n \nApplicant testified that the relationship between him and his child\u2019s mother ended \nin December 2017. As her name is still on the lease, she has continued to reside in their \nhome approximately two to three days out of the week. He unsuccessfully attempted to \nremove her name from the lease. He has known her since elementary school. They \ndated briefly in high school but fell out of touch when their families moved. They \nreconnected and began dating again in May 2014. He testified that he did not take the \ntime to get to know her, and he learned throughout the course of their relationship that \nshe has a criminal background, to include domestic-violence-related charges from \nprevious relationships. He also learned that \u201cthe way that she communicates is through \nviolence. And she\u2019s clever. I have to give that to her because she calls the police.\u201d He \ntestified that he never initiated any violence, as he is not a violent person. He has not \nbrought domestic-violence-related charges against her because she is his child\u2019s \nmother and does not want her to get into trouble.9  \n \n \nIn the future, Applicant intends to be more pragmatic in how he assesses and \nresponds to situations involving his child\u2019s mother, and to call the police if necessary. \nHe no longer intends to protect her at his expense. He does not have any other \ncriminal-related incidents. He testified that his employer was aware of his 2014 and \n2015 charges, but he had not yet reported his 2018 charge. While he was concerned \nabout the impact on his employment that the outcome of his 2018 charge would have, \nhe was not concerned about his employer finding out about it.10  \n \n \nThe SOR also alleges the following delinquent accounts: a medical debt of $478 \n(SOR \u00b6 3.a); eight student loans totaling $118,656 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 3.b-3.i); and four consumer \naccounts totaling $1,602 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 3.j-3.m). The debts are established by a 2018 credit \nbureau report. Applicant also disclosed his debts in his 2015 security clearance \napplication (SCA).11  \n                                                     \n8 Tr. at 56-63, 66-68, 72, 108-109; GE 11, 13. \n \n9 Tr. at 53-56, 60-62, 64-69, 78-83, 104-105, 107-109, 123-128; GE 1; AE G. \n \n10 Tr. at 53-56, 60-62, 64-69, 78-83, 104-105, 107-109, 123-128; GE 1; AE G. \n \n11 GE 1, 12; AE Q. \n\n \n5 \n \n \nApplicant attributed his delinquent debts to being the primary provider from \napproximately 2014 to 2018 for his child, his child\u2019s mother, and her 10-year-old child \nfrom a previous relationship. He was also involved in a no-fault car accident in which his \ncar was totaled. He received $4,000 from the accident, but he had to apply it towards \nthe expense of obtaining another car. He attributed his minor medical debt to his \ninvoluntary termination.12 \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 3.a is for a $478 medical debt. Applicant testified that he believed he had \nhealth insurance after his involuntary termination from a previous employer. He \nindicated that he did not receive a bill for his visit to an urgent care center for strep \nthroat, and he was unaware of this debt until he received the SOR. He researched the \ndebt and intended to resolve it with his tax refund.13  \n \n \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 3.b through 3.i are for Applicant\u2019s eight defaulted student loans from his \nbachelor\u2019s degree, totaling approximately $118,656. He testified that he first learned \nthat his loans were in default when he began working with the credit-repair company \nLexington Law in May 2018 to resolve his delinquent accounts, as he did not receive \nany delinquent notices. He contacted the U.S. Department of Education after he \nreceived the amended SOR in November 2018, and he set up an income-based \npayment plan of $5 monthly for nine months to get his loans out of default. As of the \ndate of the hearing, he paid a total of $10 towards that plan; he also made a $10 \npayment in December 2018. He intended to continue to abide by the payment plan, and \nonce his loans were out of default, he intended to make timely monthly payments \ntowards his student loans.14 \n \n \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 3.j and 3.k are for two credit cards in collection for a total of $827. \nApplicant testified that he cosigned the credit cards for his child\u2019s mother in \napproximately 2015. He intended to resolve them with his tax refund.15 \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 3.l is for a charged-off credit-card account for $238. Applicant testified that \nhe was a victim of identity theft or hacking, so he closed his account with the creditor in \n2015. He testified that he is a claimant to a pending federal lawsuit against the creditor, \nand he believed the account would be resolved through the lawsuit. He testified that he \ndisputed the debt through Lexington Law. Since he canceled his subscription with \nLexington Law, he intended to dispute the debt directly with the credit bureaus.16 \n \n                                                     \n12 Tr. at 83-105, 108-113. \n \n13 Tr. at 83-85, 91-92; GE 12. \n \n14 Tr. at 92-99, 110-111; GE 12; AE D, E, F, G. \n \n15 Tr. at 102; GE 12. \n \n16 Tr. at 102-104; GE 12. \n\n \n6 \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 3.m is for another charged-off credit-card account for $537. Applicant \ntestified that this debt is for his credit card, which he forgot about. He intended to \nresolve it with his tax refund.17 \n \n \nAs of the date of the hearing, Applicant worked as a financial analyst for his \ncurrent employer. He was promoted in October 2018. His annual income was $61,200. \nHe testified that he received financial counseling from three credit-repair companies, \nCredit Karma in 2016, and Credit Sesame and Lexington Law in 2018. He canceled his \nsubscription to Lexington Law because he did not find them helpful; however, he was \ncontinuing to monitor his credit through Credit Sesame. He has also received budget \ntraining at work, and he has a budget. He is current on his rent of $1,225 monthly and \nhis car payment of $360 monthly. He continues to be primarily responsible for his child\u2019s \nexpenses, as his child\u2019s mother does not contribute. After expenses, his monthly net \nremainder is approximately $500. He has a savings account with a balance of $140. He \nhas a retirement account with an unknown balance. He testified that \u201cI\u2019m just now \nstarting to really take control of my finances,\u201d whereas in the past five years, he focused \non his immediate, day-to-day expenses.18 \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s previous supervisor described Applicant as an \u201cexceptional member \nof our team,\u201d and stated that he had \u201cfull confidence in [Applicant\u2019s] ability to maintain [a \nsecurity clearance].\u201d Applicant\u2019s pastor of ten years described Applicant as a highly \nprofessional and trustworthy individual. A friend of ten years described Applicant to be \nan \u201cupstanding, centered, and skilled gentleman.\u201d19 \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n                                                     \n17 Tr. at 104; GE 12.  \n \n18 Tr. at 66-67, 69-72, 76-79, 83-92, 98-102; AE E, F. \n \n19 AE A, B, C. \n\n \n7 \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.  \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nSection 7 of Exec. Or. 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms \nof the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also Exec. Or. 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple \nprerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct \n \nThe security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 30: \n \nCriminal activity creates doubt about a person\u2019s judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person's ability \nor willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations. \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 31. The following is potentially applicable in this case:  \n \n(b) evidence (including, but not limited to, a credible allegation, an \nadmission, and matters of official record) of criminal conduct, regardless of \nwhether the individual was formally charged, prosecuted, or convicted. \n \nApplicant\u2019s 2012 charge for driving with a suspended license is a traffic-related \noffense. He was found not guilty of his July 2015 assault charge, after his child's mother \nadmitted that she lied about the underlying incident. I find that AG \u00b6 31(b) does not \napply to SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.d and I find SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.d in Applicant\u2019s favor. \n\n \n8 \n \nApplicant\u2019s 2014 alcohol-related charges occurred after he admitted to an officer \nthat he had consumed alcohol prior to driving his car over a tree submerged under \nwater. He acknowledged that he was arrested and charged with assault in August 2015 \nafter the officers saw blood on his child\u2019s mother\u2019s forehead. He acknowledged that he \nthrew her purse at her and the buckle of the purse scratched her forehead causing her \nto bleed. His 2018 assault charge is pending. AG \u00b6 31(b) applies to SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b, 1.c, \n1.e, and 1.f. \nThe potentially relevant mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 32 are as follows:  \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur \nand does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or \ngood judgment; \n \n(c) no reliable evidence to support that the individual committed the \noffense; and \n \n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including, but not limited \nto, the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, restitution, \ncompliance with the terms of parole or probation, job training or higher \neducation, \ngood \nemployment \nrecord, \nor \nconstructive \ncommunity \ninvolvement. \n \n \nApplicant resolved his one-time alcohol-related charges in 2014 through \nprobation before judgment. AG \u00b6\u00b6 32(a) and 32(d) apply to SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b and 1.c and I \nfind SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b and 1.c in Applicant\u2019s favor.  \n \n \nThough Applicant resolved the August 2015 assault charge through probation \nbefore judgment, his 2018 assault charge is pending. I am thus unable to find that such \nconduct is unlikely to recur, that he did not commit the offenses, that there is evidence \nof successful rehabilitation, or that so much time has elapsed and it does not cast doubt \non his reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment. AG \u00b6\u00b6 32(a), 32(c), and 32(d) are \nnot established as to SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.e and 1.f. \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \n \nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the security concern pertaining to personal conduct:  \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes.  \n\n \n9 \n \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. I considered the following relevant: \n(c) credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is \nnot sufficient for an adverse determination under any other single \nguideline, but which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-\nperson \nassessment \nof \nquestionable \njudgment, \nuntrustworthiness, \nunreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and \nregulations, or other characteristics indicating that the individual may not \nproperly safeguard classified or sensitive information; and \n \n(e) personal conduct, or concealment of information about one\u2019s conduct, \nthat creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress by a \nforeign intelligence entity or other individual or group. Such conduct \nincludes: (1) engaging in activities which, if known, could affect the \nperson\u2019s personal, professional, or community standing . . . . \n \nFor the reasons set forth above, AG \u00b6\u00b6 16(c) and 16(e) do not apply to the 2012 \ntraffic-related offense or the July 2015 assault charge in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.d. For the \nreasons set forth above, AG \u00b6 16(c) applies to SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b, 1.c, 1.e, and 1.f, and AG \u00b6 \n16(e)(1) also applies to SOR \u00b6 1.f. While Applicant testified that he reported his 2014 \nand 2015 charges to his employer, and he was not concerned about his employer \nfinding out about his 2018 assault charge, he had not yet reported it to his employer. He \nwas concerned about the impact that the outcome of his 2018 charge would have on his \nemployment.   \nI have considered all of the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 17 and considered \nthe following relevant:  \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, \nunreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely \nto recur; \n \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate \nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress; and \n \n(f) the information was unsubstantiated or from a source of questionable \nreliability. \n \n\n \n10 \n \n \nFor the same reasons as set forth above in my Guideline J analysis, AG \u00b6\u00b6 17(c), \n17(d), and 17(e) are established as to SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b and 1.c. AG \u00b6\u00b6 17(c), 17(d), and \n17(e), and 17(f) are not established as to SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.e and 1.f, and thus Applicant has \nnot established mitigation for SOR \u00b6 2.a. \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18:       \n \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds . . . . \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case:  \n  \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \n \n \nApplicant was unable to pay his debts. The evidence is sufficient to raise AG \u00b6\u00b6 \n19(a) and 19(c) as disqualifying conditions.  \n \n  \nConditions that could mitigate the financial considerations security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 20. The following are potentially applicable:  \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \n\n \n11 \n \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control; \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and  \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \n \nApplicant credibly testified that he believed SOR \u00b6 3.l would be resolved through \na pending federal lawsuit in which he is a claimant, as the debt was incurred because \nhe was a victim of identity theft or hacking. AG \u00b6 20(e) applies to SOR \u00b6 3.l and I find \nSOR \u00b6 3.l in Applicant\u2019s favor. \n \nConditions beyond Applicant\u2019s control, as previously discussed, contributed to his \nfinancial problems. Thus, the first prong of AG \u00b6 20(b) applies. For the full application of \nAG \u00b6 20(b), he must provide evidence that he acted responsibly under his \ncircumstances. He sought and received credit counseling, and he was continuing to \nmonitor his credit as of the date of the hearing. However, while he learned that his \nstudent loans were in default in May 2018, he did not contact the U.S. Department of \nEducation until after he received the amended SOR in November 2018. As of the date \nof the hearing, he had just started his nine-month rehabilitation plan and his student \nloans remained in default. He had not yet done anything to resolve his remaining debts, \nas he intended to do so with his tax refund. I find that AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a), 20(b), 20(c), and \n20(d) are not established as to SOR \u00b6\u00b6 3.a through 3.k and 3.m. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.        \n\n \n12 \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments \nunder Guidelines J, E, and F in my whole-person analysis. Overall, the record evidence \nleaves me with questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a \nsecurity clearance. I conclude he has not mitigated the criminal conduct, personal \nconduct, and financial considerations security concerns. Eligibility for access to \nclassified information is denied.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline J:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.d:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.e \u2013 1.f:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nParagraph 3, Guideline F:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 3.a \u2013 3.k:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 3.l:  \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 3.m:  \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security \nclearance.

O\u2019Connell, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro Se\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nMETZ, John Grattan, Jr., Administrative Judge:\nBased on the record in this case.  I grant Applicant\u2019s clearance.\n1\nOn 27 September 2016, the Department of Defense (DoD) sent Applicant a\nStatement of Reasons (SOR) raising security concerns under Guideline J, Criminal\nConduct, Guideline G, Alcohol Consumption, Guideline H, Drug Involvement, and\nGuideline E, Personal Conduct.  Applicant timely answered the SOR, requesting a\n2\nhearing before the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA). DOHA assigned\nConsisting of the transcript (Tr.), Government exhibits (GE ) 1-8, and Applicant exhibit (AE) A.\n1\nDoD acted under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information Within Industry (February 20,\n2\n1960), as amended; DoD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program\n(January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) effective within the DoD on\n1 September 2006. On 10 December 2016, the Director of National Intelligence (DNI) signed Security\nExecutive Agent Directive 4, implementing new AG, effective with any decision issued on or after 8 June 2017.\nThis decision is issued under the original AG, but I have examined the new AG to ensure that I would not\nreach a different result if I issued this decision under the new AG. I would not rule differently under either set\nof AG.\n1\n12/20/2018\n\nthe case to me 14 August 2017, and I convened a hearing on 28 September 2017.\nDOHA received the transcript 5 October 2017, and the record closed.\nFindings of Fact\nApplicant admitted the SOR allegations. He is a 30-year-old project manager \nemployed by a defense contractor since July 2005, when he graduated high school. He\nmarried in September 2015, and he and his wife have a son, born November 2016. He\nseeks to retain the clearance he was issued in November 2005.\nApplicant used alcohol under questionable circumstances from June 2008 to July\n2012, resulting in three incidents indicative of poor judgment. In June 2008, he was\ncharged with operating a vessel under the influence of alcohol (SOR 1.a). He received\nand completed probation before judgment, and the charge was dismissed. In August\n2011, he was charged with driving under the influence of alcohol, when he had a .12%\nblood alcohol content (SOR 1.c). He was otherwise satisfactorily completing the terms\nof his sentence when he was again charged with driving under the influence (.12%\nblood alcohol content), and speeding, in May 2012 (SOR 1.d). Because of this second\narrest, Applicant was found to be in violation of the terms of his probation for the August\n2011 arrest, and received additional punishment (SOR 1.e). Applicant ultimately\ncompleted the sentencing requirements of these arrests, and has been off probation for\nover three years (Tr. 39, AE A). Applicant\u2019s criminal record included a July 2010 driving\non a suspended license charge which was nolle prossed (SOR 1.b),  and a July 2012\n3\ncitation for possessing alcohol in a campground (SOR 1.e).4\nBetween 2008 and 2010, at a time Applicant was in an apprenticeship program\nwith his employer, Applicant used marijuana 2-3 times with coworkers. Applicant was\nnot aware that he had been granted a clearance in November 2005, but was aware that\nhe had applied for a clearance. Applicant has not used marijuana since 2010, and the\ncoworkers with whom he used marijuana are no longer employed by the company. \nApplicant acknowledged that his poor decisions reflect adversely on his\njudgment, but attributes them to his youth (Tr. 22, 42). However, he notes that since his\nmarriage and the birth of his son, his lifestyle has changed. His wife\u2019s family does not\nengage in the kind of misconduct that punctuated Applicant\u2019s youth, and he wants to set\na good example for his son and maintain the kind of good image his wife\u2019s family has.\nThe vice president of his company, who has known Applicant for over ten years, is\naware of his misconduct and recommends him for his clearance (Answer). He also\nsuccessfully completed a voluntary county outpatient substance abuse program in\nApplicant moved to a new state, and failed to comply with state requirements to transfer his license. His old \n3\nstate license was suspended, which was discovered during a routine traffic stop not otherwise alleged in the\nSOR.\nA park ranger observed a visitor to Applicant\u2019s campsite in possession of alcohol, a violation of campground\n4\nrules.  The visitor had left the campsite, but because the campsite was registered to Applicant, Applicant was\ncited, and paid a fine.\n2\n\nFebruary 2014, a program which included random drug and alcohol screenings, all of\nwhich were negative (Answer).\nPolicies\nThe AG list factors to evaluate a person\u2019s suitability for access to classified\ninformation. Administrative judges must assess disqualifying and mitigating conditions\nunder each issue fairly raised by the facts and situation presented. Each decision must\nalso show a fair, impartial, and commonsense consideration of the factors listed in AG \u00b6\n2(d). The applicability of a disqualifying or mitigating condition is not, by itself,\nconclusive. However, specific guidelines should be followed when a case can be\nmeasured against them, as they are policy guidance governing the grant or denial of a\nclearance. Considering the SOR allegations and the evidence as a whole, the relevant\nadjudicative guidelines are Guideline G (Alcohol Consumption), and Guideline J\n(Criminal Conduct), Guideline H (Drug Involvement), and Guideline E (Personal\nConduct).\nSecurity clearance decisions resolve whether it is clearly consistent with the\nnational interest to grant or continue an applicant\u2019s security clearance. The Government\nmust prove, by substantial evidence, controverted facts alleged in the SOR. If it does,\nthe burden shifts to applicant to refute, extenuate, or mitigate the Government\u2019s case. \nBecause no one has a right to a security clearance, the applicant bears a heavy burden\nof persuasion.\nPersons with access to classified information enter into a fiduciary relationship\nwith the Government based on trust and confidence. Therefore, the Government has a\ncompelling interest in ensuring each applicant possesses the required judgment,\nreliability, and trustworthiness of those who must protect national interests as their own.\nThe \u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d standard compels deciding any\nreasonable doubt about an Applicant\u2019s suitability for access in favor of the Government.5\nAnalysis\nThe Government established a case for disqualification under Guideline J, but\nApplicant mitigated the security concerns. The dismissed July 2010 driving on a\nsuspended license charge and the July 2012 citation for possessing (constructively)\nalcohol in a campground lack security significance even under a disqualifying condition\nwhich contemplates a pattern of minor misconduct. However, three alcohol-related\narrests and a related probation violation constituted criminal conduct. Nevertheless, in\nthis case, even the combination of offenses does not raise any security concerns\nbeyond those considered under Guideline G, and while Applicant violated his probation\non his August 2011 arrest, he otherwise satisfactorily completed the court-ordered\nSee, Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518 (1988).\n5\n3\n\nrequirements for that arrest as well as the other two arrests.  Moreover, even if I\n6\nconcluded that the disqualifying conditions were fully applicable, the corresponding\nmitigating conditions remove any security concerns.  Applicant completed all his\n7\nsentencing requirements and has an excellent employment record. Moreover, marriage,\nmaturity, and parenthood have had salutary influence on his life outlook. Accordingly, I\nresolve Guideline J for Applicant.\nIn similar fashion, the Government established a case for disqualification under\nGuideline G, by demonstrating Applicant\u2019s three alcohol-related arrests between June\n2008 and July 2012, the last of which triggered a probation violation.  Although the\n8\nrecord does not reflect a formal diagnosis of alcohol use disorder, such diagnosis is not\nrequired to raise a security concern.  Nevertheless, I find that Applicant has mitigated\n9\nthe security concerns.\nApplicant\u2019s last alcohol-related arrest was over six years aga, and he has not\nconsumed alcohol for several years. Thus, \u00b623(a) partially applies, in that I concluded\nthat enough time has passed and the conduct is unlikely to recur. However, while\n\u00b622(d)-(g) do not fully apply because there has been no documented diagnosis, and\n\u00b623(c)-(d) do not fully apply because of questions about the nature of Applicant\u2019s\ntreatment programs, \u00b623(b) fully applies.  Moreover, after his May 2012 charge,\n10\nApplicant took a different approach to his alcohol use problem. In addition to fully\ncomplying with the court requirements for education, Applicant voluntarily undertook a\nsubstance abuse program with the county, that he completed in 2014.\n\u00b631(a) a pattern of minor offenses, any one of which on its own would be unlikely to affect a national security\n6\neligibility decision, but which in combination cast doubt on the individual\u2019s judgment, reliability, or\ntrustworthiness ; . . . (d) violation or revocation of parole or probation, or failure to complete a court-ordered\nrehabilitation program;\n\u00b632(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened . . . that it is unlikely to recur and\n7\ndoes not cast doubt on the individuals\u2019 reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; (d) there is evidence of\nsuccessful rehabilitation; including, but not limited to, the passage of time without recurrence of criminal\nactivity, restitution, compliance with the terms of parole or probation, job training or higher education, good\nemployment record, or constructive community involvement.\nHowever, as with the criminal conduct concerns, the constructive alcohol possession citation does not really\n8\nhave any security significance under alcohol consumption as he was not consuming alcohol, and did not\nactually possess the alcohol.\n\u00b622(a) alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while under the influence, fighting, child or\n9\nspouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or other incidents of concern . . .; (b) alcohol-related incidents at work,\nsuch as reporting for work or duty in an intoxicated or impaired condition . . . regardless of whether the\nindividual is diagnosed as an alcohol abuser or alcohol dependent; (c) habitual or binge consumption of\nalcohol to the point of impaired judgment . . .; (d) diagnosis by a duly qualified medical professional or mental\nhealth professional. . . of alcohol use disorder;\n\u00b623(b) the individual acknowledges his or her pattern of maladaptive alcohol use, provides evidence of\n10\nactions taken to overcome this problem, and has demonstrated a clear and established pattern of modified\nconsumption or abstinence in accordance with treatment recommendations; \n4\n\n \nFurther, Applicant\u2019s character reference finds his reliability and work ethic to be\nexceptional. I conclude Applicant is unlikely to abuse alcohol in the future. Accordingly, I\nresolve Guideline G for Applicant.\nThe Government established a case for disqualification under Guideline H, by\ndemonstrating Applicant\u2019s illegal drug abuse between 2008 and 2010, a period during\nwhich Applicant held a clearance, but Applicant mitigated the security concerns.11\nApplicant\u2019s drug use was essentially experimental, occurred right after high school, and\nended over seven years ago. Setting aside for the moment whether Applicant actually\nknew that he held a clearance, he knew that he had applied for one\u2014which put him on\nnotice of the Government\u2019s view of illegal drug use\u2014and it is unlikely his employer\ntolerated illegal drug involvement. Nevertheless, the drug use was minimal.\nDrug involvement mitigating conditions give much support to Applicant. His illegal\ndrug abuse was not recent, was not frequent, and seems unlikely to recur.  Applicant\u2019s\n12\nsubstance abuse program covered both his alcohol and marijuana use. All the use\noccurred before his marriage and parenthood, and with coworkers who are no longer\nwith the company.  Under the circumstances,  I conclude Applicant is unlikely to abuse\n13\nillegal drugs in the future. Accordingly, I resolve Guideline H against Applicant.\nThe Government failed to establish a case for disqualification under Guideline E.\nThe conduct complained of\u2014the five criminal charges at SOR 1.a-1.e and the\nmarijuana use at SOR 3.a\u2014are fully cognizable as criminal conduct and drug use,\nrespectively. No critical mass is achieved by combining the two. The disqualifying\ncondition cited by the Government, \u00b616(d), is not satisfied.  Accordingly, I resolve\n14\nGuideline E for Applicant.\n \n\u00b625(a) any substance misuse; (c) illegal possession of a controlled substance . . . ;(f) any illegal drug use\n11\nwhile granted access to classified information or holding a sensitive position;\n\u00b626(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened under such circumstances that\n12\nit is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good\njudgment [Emphasis supplied];\n\u00b626(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and substance misuse, provides evidence\n13\nof actions taken to overcome this problem, and has established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not\nlimited to: (1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; (2) changing or avoiding the\nenvironment where drugs were used;\n\u00b616 (d) credible adverse information that is not explicitly covered under any other guideline and may not be\n14\nsufficient by itself for an adverse determination, but which, when combined with all available information\nsupports a whole-person assessment of questionable, judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of\ncandor, unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that the person\nmay not properly safeguard protected information. This included but is not limited to consideration of: . . . (3)\na pattern of . . . rule violations.\n5\n\nFormal Findings\nParagraph 1.

Connelley, Esq., Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro se \n \n \n___________ \n \nDecision \n___________ \n \nBENSON, Pamela C., Administrative Judge: \n \n \nApplicant failed to mitigate the security concerns under Guideline F (Financial \nConsiderations). Given the nature and seriousness of Applicant\u2019s failure to timely file \nFederal and state income tax returns for numerous years, his significant outstanding tax \ndelinquencies and unresolved promissory note, and the length of time they have been \nunresolved, Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance is denied.  \n \nStatement of the Case \n \n \nOn February 5, 2015, Applicant submitted a security clearance application (SCA). \nOn May 23, 2017, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications Facility (DOD \nCAF) issued to Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security concerns \nunder Guideline F (Financial Considerations). The action was taken under Executive \nOrder (EO) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, \n1960), as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security \nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the \nadjudicative guidelines (AG) effective within the DOD on September 1, 2006. On June 8, \n2017, new AGs were implemented and are effective for decisions issued after that date.1  \n \n                                            \n1 I considered the previous AGs, effective September 1, 2006, as well as the new AGs, effective June 8, \n2017. My decision would be the same if the case was considered under the previous AGs. \n12/17/2018\n\n \n2 \n                                         \n \nOn September 21, 2017, Applicant responded to the SOR, and requested a \nhearing. On March 28, 2018, the case was assigned to me. On June 28, 2018, the \nDefense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a notice of hearing, setting the \nhearing for July 25, 2018. Applicant\u2019s hearing was held as scheduled.  \n  \nDuring the hearing, Department Counsel offered seven exhibits, Government \nExhibit (GE) 1-7, and Applicant offered ten exhibits, Applicant Exhibit (AE) A-J. There \nwere no objections, and all proffered exhibits were admitted into evidence. On August 2, \n2018, DOHA received the hearing transcript (Tr.).  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn Applicant\u2019s SOR response, he denied all eight allegations set forth in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 \n1.a through 1.h.   \n \nApplicant is a 57-year-old licensed attorney. He honorably served in the U.S. Air \nForce on active duty from 1986 through 1992. Applicant earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in \n1985, a master\u2019s degree in 1987, and a juris doctorate in 2003. He is married and has \none adult child. He is sponsored for national security eligibility by a DOD contractor, for \nwhich Applicant is the Chief Executive Officer. (CEO) (Tr. 8-9; GE 1) \n \nFinancial Considerations \n \n \nThe SOR alleges that Applicant failed to timely file state and Federal income tax \nreturns for multiple years. He owes three state tax debts, three Federal tax debts, and he \nhas an unsatisfied judgment. The combined total of Applicant\u2019s delinquent indebtedness \nis approximately $802,288. The record establishes the status of Applicant\u2019s unpaid \naccounts and untimely tax returns as follows: \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.a alleges Applicant failed to file state and Federal income tax returns for \ntax years 2003, 2004, 2005, 2006, 2007, 2008, 2011, and 2012. He denied this allegation \nin his SOR response because he has since filed all of his state and Federal income tax \nreturns. The testimony and evidence at the hearing showed that Applicant did not timely \nfile his state and Federal income tax returns for tax years 2003, 2004, 2005, 2006, 2007, \n2008, 2011, and 2012, as required. The income tax returns for tax year 2003 was filed in \n2006, and the income tax returns for tax years 2004 through 2008 were filed in 2009. Tax \nyears 2011 and 2012 income tax returns were filed in May 2014. (Tr. 10 -13, 49, 55, 89-\n91) \n \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b, c, and d allege Applicant had two state tax liens entered against him \nin 2013, and another state tax lien entered against him in 2016, in the combined total \namount of $37,097. Applicant denied these allegations in his response to the SOR. The \ntestimony and evidence at the hearing showed that Applicant\u2019s state tax liens are unpaid \nand unresolved. (Tr. 15, 50, 72) \n \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.e, and f allege Applicant had a Federal tax lien entered against him in \n2009, and another Federal tax lien entered against him in 2016, in the combined total \n\n \n3 \n                                         \n \namount of $654,148. Applicant denied these allegations in his response to the SOR. The \ntestimony and evidence at the hearing showed that Applicant\u2019s Federal tax liens are \nunpaid and unresolved. (Tr. 15, 50, 72) \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.g alleges Applicant is indebted to the Federal Government for delinquent \n2005 income taxes in the amount of $20,225. He denied this allegation in his response to \nthe SOR. The testimony and evidence at the hearing showed that the Federal \nGovernment is currently claiming approximately $860,000 for Applicant\u2019s combined \ndelinquent Federal taxes. Applicant initiated a one-year repayment agreement to pay \n$500 per month to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) four weeks before his hearing. At \nthe time of his hearing, Applicant had not yet made any payments to the IRS for resolution \nof these delinquent taxes. (Tr. 15, 50, 72, 88, 92-93, 95; AE H; AE J) \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.h alleges Applicant owes on a bank promissory note in the amount of \n$90,818. The bank filed a lawsuit against him in October 2014 to collect this debt. He \ndenied this allegation in his response to the SOR. The testimony and evidence at the \nhearing showed that this case is still pending litigation and the debt is unresolved. \nApplicant believes that he has repaid this debt in full and possibly overpaid the debt, but \nhe failed to provide evidence at the hearing showing his history of payments on this \naccount. Applicant claimed that he never received any statements from the bank and the \npayments on this note were automatically deducted from his bank account for years. He \ncalled his law partner as a witness since she represented Applicant during the litigation \nof the alleged promissory note, now valued at approximately $150,000. (Tr. 39) She \ntestified that the lawsuit was pending, and if she filed a motion to dismiss the case, she \nbelieved it would most likely be granted by the court. As of the date of the hearing, \nApplicant\u2019s attorney had not filed a motion to dismiss the case, and there was no evidence \npresented of Applicant\u2019s claimed payments on this account. This debt is unresolved. (Tr. \n20-21, 25-31, 33-35, 40, 77-78; AE A - G) \n \nApplicant stated that his financial problems stem from a catastrophic, million-dollar \nloss from a fire that damaged his rental property in 2003. He received a letter from his \ninsurance company the very day the fire occurred advising him that the insurance \ncompany would no longer insure his rental properties. Applicant suffered a heart attack \nshortly thereafter. He was financially ruined, and he borrowed $60,000 from his friends to \nsurvive. Applicant reported that he has repaid all that borrowed money to his friends. (Tr. \n10, 92) \n \nApplicant\u2019s office also burned in the fire, and he lost all business records. He did \nnot timely file state or Federal income tax returns for 2003, but he eventually filed those \nincome tax returns. He did not file his state and Federal income tax returns for tax year \n2004 because he was depressed, and he was on the verge of financial ruin. Applicant \neventually hired a certified public accountant (CPA). The CPA took Applicant\u2019s tax records \nand money, and made an appearance on his behalf before the IRS. About a year and a \nhalf later, the CPA kept the money, returned the tax records to Applicant, and told him he \ncould not help Applicant with his tax issues.  (Tr. 10-11) \n \n\n \n4 \n                                         \n \nApplicant hired a second CPA in about 2005, and he immediately noticed that his \nincome tax returns were finally being filed. The IRS requested to do an audit of Applicant\u2019s \nfiled 2009 and 2010 income tax returns. Applicant testified that he and his CPA met with \nan IRS representative. The IRS representative had Applicant sign a Power of Attorney \n(POA) for his CPA, and then she advised him that she would reschedule the audit. \nApplicant claimed the IRS representative instructed him not to open his mail from \nthe IRS because it would only upset him.  He thought that the IRS representative would \nsend the notices of the audits to Applicant and Applicant\u2019s tax representative(s), the CPA \nand eventually Applicant\u2019s sister, who is an IRS enrolled agent and was also added to \nApplicant\u2019s POA. (Tr. 11-13, 65-66, 84-85, 90) \n \nAfter an extended period of time, Applicant contacted his CPA to determine his \ncurrent tax status. The IRS audits for tax years 2009-2010 and 2012-2013 had already \noccurred when Applicant learned that the IRS failed to provide any notices of the audits \nto his tax representative(s). Applicant admitted that he had received an envelope from the \nIRS that contained the audit notice for both of his audits. He did not open any mail from \nthe IRS based on the advice he received from the IRS representative. Since no one \nappeared at the hearing for Applicant\u2019s Federal tax audits, all expenses reported on \nApplicant\u2019s 2009-2010, and 2012-2013 income tax returns were disallowed by the IRS for \ntax write-offs. (Tr. 12-13, 44, 64-70; AE I) \n \nApplicant\u2019s sister, who is a tax expert, testified as a witness. She stated that the \nIRS agent\u2019s letter (AE I) pointed out that Applicant\u2019s CPA would not have been provided \na notice of the tax audit since her name was added to the POA in about 2016, which \nessentially cancelled the CPA on the POA. She also stated that, at one point in time, the \nCPA and she were both listed on the POA, but in late 2016 Applicant took action to have \nthe CPA\u2019s name removed from the POA. She believed Applicant\u2019s two audits, for tax \nyears 2009-2010 and 2012-2013, took place prior to her name being added on the POA, \nso she would not have received any of the audit notices. She did state that Applicant\u2019s \nCPA would have received these audit notices prior 2016. (Tr. 53) She testified that her \nbrother had talked with his CPA about the audit hearings and the CPA said he had it \nhandled. The CPA had obviously received the audit notices but he was not appearing at \nthe audit hearings, as he told her brother.2 (Tr. 58-59, 61) The audit for 2009-2010 tax \nyears would have most likely taken place in 2011 or 2012, and the audit for 2012-2013 \nwould have most likely taken place in 2014 or 2015. Applicant\u2019s sister filed Applicant\u2019s \n2016 and 2017 income tax returns. She stated that her brother owed taxes for both of \nthose tax years, but he did not pay the Federal taxes owed because he did not have the \nfunds. (Tr. 62)  She submitted a request for an audit reconsideration in September 2017 \nbut, as of the date of the hearing, the IRS had not yet responded to that request. (Tr. 42-\n47, 52-55, 58-63, 72; AE H; AE I) \n \n                                            \n2 Applicant\u2019s sister\u2019s testimony conflicts with Applicant\u2019s testimony that his CPA did not receive any audit \nnotices from the IRS. Applicant claimed that after the audits were over and no one appeared, he then \nreceived information from the IRS that showed he owed a horrendous amount of Federal taxes for those \naudited tax years. He admitted that he received the audit notices from the IRS. Applicant stated that his \nsister\u2019s testimony was in error. (Tr. 64-68, 73-74)  \n\n \n5 \n                                         \n \nApplicant stated that the total amount of Federal and state delinquent taxes were \nmerely unrealistic numbers due to his disallowed expenses. Applicant wishes to have his \ntax issues resolved so he can pay the actual tax money that is owed and be in complete \ncompliance. His most recent notice from the IRS disclosed that he currently owes \napproximately $860,000 for Federal tax liabilities. (Tr. 15, 50, 72) Applicant recently set-\nup a one-year repayment plan with the IRS covering tax years 2005, 2008, 2009, 2010, \n2012, 2013, 2014, 2015, 2016, and 2017, which includes all of the tax years with \ndelinquent Federal taxes owed. As of the date of his hearing, he had not yet made any \npayments on the one-year repayment plan. He noted that the state tax authority relies on \nthe Federal Government to determine an individual\u2019s tax liability. Once the Federal tax \nnumbers are correctly calculated, the state tax authority will then reset his state taxes, \ninterest, and penalties numbers. He has not yet made any payments on his outstanding \nstate taxes. (Tr. 13-15, 48-51; 61-62, 71, 76, 87-88; AE H, J) \n \nPolicies \n \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the Executive \nBranch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security emphasizing, \n\u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. \n518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to control \naccess to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual \nis sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The President \nhas authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicant\u2019s eligibility for \naccess to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \nIndustry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended.  \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable.  \n \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nabout potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Adverse \nclearance decisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a \ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 7. \nThus, nothing in this decision should be construed to suggest that it is based, in whole or \nin part, on any express or implied determination about applicant\u2019s allegiance, loyalty, or \npatriotism. It is merely based on whether the applicant has met the strict guidelines the \n\n \n6 \n                                         \n \nPresident, Secretary of Defense, and Security Executive Agent have established for \nissuing a clearance. \n  \n \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 at 2 \n(App. Bd. May 2, 1996). \n \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it \nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d \nISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). The burden of disproving a \nmitigating condition never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 \n(App. Bd. Sept. 22, 2005). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if they must, \non the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \n \nAG \u00b6 18 articulates the security concern for financial problems: \n \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. . . . An individual who is financially \noverextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or otherwise \nquestionable acts to generate funds. . . . \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. I \nhave considered all of the disqualifying conditions under AG \u00b6 19, and the following \nare potentially applicable: \n \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; \n \n(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so;  \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \n \n\n \n7 \n                                         \n \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired. \n \nThe evidence shows that Applicant did not timely file his Federal and state income \ntax returns for tax years 2003, 2004, 2005, 2006, 2007, 2008, 2011, and 2012. The \nevidence also shows that he owes over $800,000 for delinquent taxes and an unresolved \npromissory note pending litigation. The above disqualifying conditions apply. \n \nThe Appeal Board explained the scope and rationale for the financial \nconsiderations security concern in ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012),  \nas follows: \n \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an applicant might \nknowingly compromise classified information in order to raise money in \nsatisfaction of his or her debts. Rather, it requires a Judge to examine the \ntotality of an applicant\u2019s financial history and circumstances. The Judge \nmust consider pertinent evidence regarding the applicant\u2019s self-control, \njudgment, and other qualities essential to protecting the national secrets as \nwell as the vulnerabilities inherent in the circumstances. The Directive \npresumes a nexus between proven conduct under any of the Guidelines \nand an applicant\u2019s security eligibility.  \n \n  \nFive financial considerations mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially \napplicable in this case:  \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago,3 was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control;  \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n                                            \n3 A debt that became delinquent several years ago is still considered recent because \u201can applicant\u2019s \nongoing, unpaid debts evidence a continuing course of conduct and, therefore, can be viewed as recent for \npurposes of the Guideline F mitigating conditions.\u201d ISCR Case No. 15-06532 at 3 (App. Bd. Feb. 16, 2017) \n(citing ISCR Case No. 15-01690 at 2 (App. Bd. Sept. 13, 2016)). \n\n \n8 \n                                         \n \n \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority \nto file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements.  \n \nApplicant has not resolved his significant delinquent tax debt; nor has he paid, \nsettled, or resolved the bank promissory note pending litigation. He just recently entered \ninto a one-year repayment agreement with the IRS but has not yet started making his \nmonthly payments. Although he provided mitigating evidence of a fire and health \nconcerns during the 2003-2004 time period, which were circumstances beyond his \ncontrol, he does not have a reasonable explanation as to why he has been unable to \nresolve his tax issues during the past 14 years. Given the heavy burden generated by his \nfailure to timely file income tax returns or pay income taxes, the length of time the taxes \nhave been outstanding, and Applicant\u2019s unsubstantiated promise to resolve his debts, I \ncannot conclude that he has mitigated any of the financial considerations security \nconcerns. There are no indications that his tax and other financial problems are under \ncontrol, and I find it probable that future issues are likely to occur. Mitigation under AG \u00b6\u00b6 \n20(a), (b), (c), (d) and 20(g) was not established. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \n     \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant national security \neligibility must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept. My comments under Guideline F are \nincorporated in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were \naddressed under that guideline but some warrant additional comment. \n \n \nLooking at the totality of Applicant\u2019s tax history and circumstances, the evidence \nclearly shows that he does not possess the requisite good judgment, responsibility, and \ntrustworthiness required by individuals entrusted with protecting our nation\u2019s secrets. \nApplicant is a licensed attorney and should be expected to know and comply with his \nobligations under Federal and state tax laws. His self-serving explanation that he did not \nopen any mail from the IRS, to include important notices of his pending IRS audits, based \n\n \n9 \n                                         \n \non an unsubstantiated and implausible claim concerning IRS representative\u2019s bad advice \nis purely irresponsible and unreasonable. \n \nGiven the nature and seriousness of Applicant\u2019s failure to timely file Federal and \nstate income tax returns for numerous years, his significant outstanding tax and bank loan \ndelinquencies, and the length of time they have been unresolved, I conclude Applicant \nhas not mitigated the financial considerations security concerns.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n  \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:   \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT  \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a through 1.h:  \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \n \n       Conclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or reinstate Applicant\u2019s eligibility for \na security clearance.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact The SOR alleges under Guideline F that, as of November 20, 2017, Applicant owed delinquent debt totaling $44,184 on nine accounts (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.i). In response to the SOR allegations, Applicant admitted three consumer credit debts of $15,449 (SOR \u00b6 1.c), $4,743 (SOR \u00b6 1.d), and $6,126 (SOR \u00b6 1.e). He denied owing a $131 satellite-television debt (SOR \u00b6 1.a), a $1,323 medical debt in collection (SOR \u00b6 1.b), a $765 charged-off balance (SOR \u00b6 1.f), a delinquent mortgage past due for $13,748 (SOR \u00b6 1.g), a $1,183 utility debt in collection (SOR \u00b6 1.h), and a $666 collection debt (SOR \u00b6 1.i). After considering the pleadings, exhibits, and transcript, I make the following findings of fact. Applicant is a 55-year-old extrusion engineer with a general equivalency diploma. He has worked for a defense contractor since July 2015. He testified that he held a clearance that was withdrawn, but he does not know the level. (Tr. 34-35.) He was married 3 to his first wife from August 1991 to October 2009, and has a 21-year-old son from that union. He has a 37-year-old daughter from a previous relationship. Applicant and his current spouse began cohabiting in September 2011. They married in September 2018. (GE 1; AE A; Tr. 30.) Applicant worked as a vice president of sales for his brother\u2019s company from October 1994 to July 2009. In July 2009, he left his job paying him $90,000 annually to start his own extrusion business in another part of their state. The expectation was that",

The financial considerations security concerns are not yet \nmitigated. Clearance is denied. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \n \nOn November 20, 2017, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications \nFacility (DOD CAF) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant, detailing security \nconcerns under Guideline F, financial considerations. The SOR explained why the DOD \nCAF was unable to find it clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue \nsecurity clearance eligibility for him. The DOD CAF took the action under Executive Order \n(EO) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as \namended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review \nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the National Security Adjudicative \nGuidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information or Eligibility to \nHold a Sensitive Position (AG) effective within the DOD on June 8, 2017. \n \n\n2 \n \nApplicant responded to the SOR on November 29, 2017, and requested a hearing \nbefore an administrative judge from the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA). \nOn April 18, 2018, the case was assigned to me to conduct a hearing to determine whether \nit is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for \nApplicant. On April 23, 2018, I scheduled a hearing for May 16, 2018. \n \n \nApplicant failed to appear at his hearing scheduled for May 16, 2018, for medical \nreasons unknown to the Government before the hearing date. On May 29, 2018, I sent a \ncertified letter to Applicant advising him that I would reschedule his hearing, but only for \ngood cause. On June 4, 2018, I received documentation confirming that Applicant was on \napproved disability from April 4, 2018, through at least June 17, 2018. I granted a \ncontinuance at Applicant\u2019s request. On August 6, 2018, I rescheduled his hearing for \nSeptember 19, 2018, advising him to note the change in location from the hearing \nscheduled for May 2018. \n \nApplicant did not show for his hearing on September 19, 2018. He went to the \nlocation of his hearing scheduled for May 2018, because he had lost the amended notice \nnoting the change in location. With no objection from the Government, on January 15, \n2019, I issued yet another amended notice, scheduling his hearing for February 13, 2019.  \n \nAt the hearing held as rescheduled on February 13, 2019, four Government exhibits \n(GEs 1-4) were admitted in evidence. A December 20, 2017 letter forwarding the proposed \nGEs to Applicant and a list of the GEs were marked as hearing exhibits (HEs I and II) for \nthe record, but were not admitted for evidentiary purposes. Applicant submitted one exhibit \n(AE A) and testified, as reflected in a transcript (Tr.) received on February 27, 2019. \n \nI held the record open to March 15, 2019, for post-hearing submissions from \nApplicant. On March 13, 2019, he submitted AEs B-G, which were admitted in evidence \nwithout any objections. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nThe SOR alleges under Guideline F that, as of November 20, 2017, Applicant owed \ndelinquent debt totaling $44,184 on nine accounts (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.i). In response to the \nSOR allegations, Applicant admitted three consumer credit debts of $15,449 (SOR \u00b6 1.c), \n$4,743 (SOR \u00b6 1.d), and $6,126 (SOR \u00b6 1.e). He denied owing a $131 satellite-television \ndebt (SOR \u00b6 1.a), a $1,323 medical debt in collection (SOR \u00b6 1.b), a $765 charged-off \nbalance (SOR \u00b6 1.f), a delinquent mortgage past due for $13,748 (SOR \u00b6 1.g), a $1,183 \nutility debt in collection (SOR \u00b6 1.h), and a $666 collection debt (SOR \u00b6 1.i). \n \n \nAfter considering the pleadings, exhibits, and transcript, I make the following \nfindings of fact. \n \nApplicant is a 55-year-old extrusion engineer with a general equivalency diploma. \nHe has worked for a defense contractor since July 2015. He testified that he held a \nclearance that was withdrawn, but he does not know the level. (Tr. 34-35.) He was married \n\n3 \n \nto his first wife from August 1991 to October 2009, and has a 21-year-old son from that \nunion. He has a 37-year-old daughter from a previous relationship. Applicant and his \ncurrent spouse began cohabiting in September 2011. They married in September 2018. \n(GE 1; AE A; Tr. 30.) \n \nApplicant worked as a vice president of sales for his brother\u2019s company from \nOctober 1994 to July 2009. In July 2009, he left his job paying him $90,000 annually to \nstart his own extrusion business in another part of their state. The expectation was that his \nbrother would refer business to him. (GE 1; Tr. 37-38, 41-42.) In October 2009, Applicant \npurchased a home in his new area. He made a down payment of $25,000 and obtained a \nmortgage loan of $144,000 (SOR \u00b6 1.g) to be repaid at $1,302 monthly. (GEs 1-4; Tr. 63-\n64.) In December 2009, he charged $1,088 on a jewelry store account for earrings (not \nalleged in SOR). In October 2010, he bought a snowmobile, obtaining a loan for $11,264, \nto be repaid at $228 per month (SOR \u00b6 1.d). In December 2011, he bought a car with a \nloan of $16,439 (not alleged in SOR). Applicant relied on credit cards obtained in August \n1987 (SOR \u00b6 1.c) and January 2010 (SOR \u00b6 1.e) for household needs. (GEs 2-4; AE A; Tr. \n47.) \n \nApplicant\u2019s income from his business was about $40,000 a year at first. It never \nexceeded $100,000. He incurred unexpected expenses in renting a building that did not \nhave adequate electrical voltage to run the equipment needed for his business. (Tr. 38-40.) \nHe had to buy a transformer that cost $25,000, which was delayed in its delivery. It put his \nbusiness behind at the start. (Tr. 38-40.) Then Applicant\u2019s brother stopped sending him \nbusiness. Applicant\u2019s income dropped to $10,000, and he began to default on some \nfinancial obligations. (Tr. 65-66.) \n \nApplicant made no payments after February 2012 on the snowmobile (SOR \u00b6 1.d), \nand the recreational vehicle was subsequently repossessed. The deficiency balance on his \nloan was charged off for $4,743 and placed for collection in November 2012. (Tr. 56.) His \ncredit-card account in SOR \u00b6 1.c became seriously delinquent in October 2012 and was \ncharged off for $15,000. He had a second account with the creditor opened in September \n1987 with a high credit of $254 that had been closed due to inactivity in September 2012. \nHe made a last payment on his credit card in SOR \u00b6 1.e in March 2012, and the creditor \ncharged off his account for $6,126 in May 2012. Applicant stopped paying on his jewelry \ndebt in early 2013, and his account was charged off for $733 in approximately July 2013. \n(GEs 1-4.) \n \nIn early 2013, Applicant\u2019s business lost its biggest customer. (Tr. 25-26, 40.) Around \nFebruary 2013, Applicant had a heart attack.1 He incurred a $1,323 ambulance charge that \nhe did not repay. He was not held responsible for repayment of his other medical bills \nbecause his income was minimal. (Tr. 49.) \n \n                                                 \n1 Applicant testified that he had a heart attack in 2014, shortly before he went to work for the trucking \ncompany. (Tr. 49-50.) Available credit reports show that the medical bill at issue is from February 2013. (GEs \n2-3.) According to his SF 86, he began working for the trucking company in 2013. (GE 1.) His present \nrecollection of the 2014 date appears to be inaccurate. (Tr. 81.) \n\n4 \n \nIn July 2013, Applicant closed his business. He used his retirement savings to pay \nhis business creditors. (Tr. 68.) He paid off a personally-guaranteed business loan of \n$77,090 in September 2013. (GE 3.) He made no payments toward his mortgage loan \n(SOR \u00b6 1.g) after July 2013, however, and he vacated the property in September 2013. As \nof April 2014, his loan was $13,748 past due on a balance of $136,203. (GEs 1-4.) \nApplicant testified that he was told when he vacated the property \u201cthat would be fine.\u201d He \nhad about $20,000 in equity in the property. (Tr. 27, 69-71.) \n \nFrom July 2013 to June 2015, Applicant worked as a truck driver earning \napproximately $50,000 annually. (GE 1; Tr. 26, 36.) In October 2013, his car was \nrepossessed, and his account was charged off. (GEs 1-4.). He borrowed $20,000 from his \nbrother to purchase a used car. According to Applicant, his brother does not expect to be \nrepaid. (Tr. 78-79.) A satellite-television debt of $131 from January 2015 was charged off \nand then placed for collection (SOR \u00b6 1.a). A credit-card account opened in May 2015 \nbecame delinquent in July 2015, and a $696 debt was charged off and placed for collection \n(SOR \u00b6 1.i). (GEs 1-4.) \n \nIn July 2015, Applicant began working for his defense-contractor employer. On \nAugust 31, 2015, he completed and certified to the accuracy of a Questionnaire for \nNational Security Positions (SF 86). In response to financial inquiries regarding any \ndelinquency on routine accounts, he indicated that he owed past-due credit-card debts of \n$6,126 (SOR 1.e), $15,449 (SOR \u00b6 1.c), and $733 for jewelry (not alleged in SOR). \nApplicant indicated that he owed nothing on his defaulted snowmobile, car, and home \nloans. Concerning his defaulted mortgage loan, he indicated that his loan was resolved in \nApril 2014, when he returned the keys to the property (SOR \u00b6 1.g). He attributed his \nfinancial delinquencies to his business loss and expressed his intention to repay his credit-\ncard debts. He also related that he was discussing possible options with an attorney about \nthe credit-card debt in SOR \u00b6 1.c. (GE 1.) At his hearing, he elaborated that he had \ndiscussed filing for bankruptcy with an attorney, but he felt at the time that he would get a \nchance to repay his creditors. (Tr. 48.) \n \nA check of Applicant\u2019s credit on September 5, 2015, revealed that his $15,449 and \n$6,126 credit-card debts, his $4,743 snowmobile loan balance, and his $1,323 medical \ndebt from February 2013 (SOR \u00b6 1.b) were in collection. His defaulted mortgage was \n$13,748 past due as of April 2014. A credit card was past due 30 days for $50 on a $468 \nbalance (SOR \u00b6 1.i). Applicant was making timely payments on two credit cards with \nbalances of $4,088 with creditor X and $584 with creditor Y. (GE 2.) \n \nOn October 6, 2015, Applicant was interviewed by an authorized investigator for the \nOffice of Personnel Management (OPM). When asked about his delinquent accounts, \nApplicant admitted that he owed the $15,449 and $6,126 credit-card debts. He asserted \nthat he owed nothing on the defaulted jewelry account, snowmobile loan, or mortgage loan. \nWhen confronted about the $1,323 medical debt, Applicant indicated that it was an \nambulance bill that he was disputing because the ambulance broke down while \ntransporting him to the hospital. As for the credit card that was past due for $50 (SOR \u00b6 \n1.i), Applicant explained that he was having trouble contacting the creditor to repay the \n\n5 \n \ndebt. He expressed a plan to start making monthly payments toward his delinquencies by \nJanuary 2016, and to attempt to verify his disputed debts. He described his financial \nsituation as stable and catching up. (AE A.) \n \nIn February 2016, the credit-card account that had been past due for $50 was \nplaced for collection for $696 with the creditor in SOR \u00b6 1.i. In April 2016, a utility provider \nplaced a $1,183 debt for collection (SOR \u00b6 1.h). (GE 3.) Applicant claims that the debt was \nincurred by subsequent tenants after he moved out of the apartment (Tr. 71), but he \nsubmitted no proof, and it is on his credit report. In April 2016, Applicant opened a credit- \ncard account, which had a current balance of $535 as of July 2016 (SOR \u00b6 1.f). As of \nAugust 2016, Applicant was making timely payments to creditor X toward a $3,376 \nbalance. (GE 3.)  \n \nAs of November 15, 2017, Equifax reported no progress toward resolving the \ndelinquencies in the SOR. Applicant\u2019s foreclosed mortgage loan was listed as $13,748 past \ndue as of April 2014 with no recent update. The balance on the defaulted snowmobile loan \n(SOR \u00b6 1.d) had accrued to $7,488. The $131 satellite-television debt (SOR \u00b6 1.a) had \nbeen placed for collection in March 2017, and was listed as unpaid as of November 5, \n2017, although Applicant testified at his hearing that he paid the debt by check \u201ca couple of \nyears ago.\u201d (Tr. 43.) His account with creditor X was current with a $3,293 balance. The \naccount has a credit limit of $3,300. (GE 4.) As of August 2015, his credit limit on the \naccount was $4,000. (GE 2.) \n \nAt his hearing, Applicant testified about the delay in addressing his past-due debts \nthat \u201cthings are just coming up in my life that are out of my control, and you know, take \nprecedence over paying debts off.\u201d (Tr. 25.) He had a motorcycle accident while on \nvacation visiting his brother in February 2018, and he was out of work on disability for \nabout eight months. (Tr. 25, 28, 74-75.) His disability income was \u201cbasically the same\u201d as \nhis employment income, but it was paid out in lump sums. (Tr. 28.) His friends raised about \nthree months\u2019 rent for him when he was in the hospital being treated for a traumatic brain \ninjury following his accident. (Tr. 29.) \n  \nOn March 13, 2019, Applicant stated that the credit-card account in SOR \u00b6 1.c and \nthe defaulted mortgage (SOR \u00b6 1.g) were being removed from his credit report. (AE B.) A \nrecord from the creditor (AE D) indicates that it could not verify an account ending in \nx36423. (AE D.) That account number matches that of the account that was closed in 2012 \ndue to inactivity and not the account ending in x23183, on which Applicant owes a $15,449 \nbalance. Applicant admitted that he has paid nothing on the credit-card debt in SOR \u00b6 1.c, \nbut he is not receiving any collection notices. (Tr. 47, 55.) Concerning the defaulted \nmortgage, documentation from the creditor indicates only that Applicant was provided with \nthe company\u2019s credit retraction fax number so that they could attempt to resolve his inquiry. \n(AE E.) Applicant testified that the debt should no longer be on his credit report because \nthe house was sold for more than what he paid for it. (Tr. 77.) Applicant presented \ndocumentation showing that his spouse had delinquent cellphone (AE F) and cable \ntelevision (AE G) accounts that were settled in November 2017. On March 11, 2019, \nApplicant made a $1,000 payment to creditor X. (AE C.) \n\n6 \n \nApplicant indicates that he had an agreement with the creditor in SOR \u00b6 1.e to settle \nhis $6,126 debt for $3,500. (AE B.) At his hearing, he testified that, a few months ago, he \nwas told he could settle the debt for $3,000, and he told the creditor that he would respond \nwhen he had the money to settle it. (Tr. 57.) Applicant asserts that he had reached out to \nthe creditor in SOR \u00b6 1.d but had no payment plan in place to address his defaulted \nsnowmobile loan; that he paid $131 to resolve the satellite-television debt (SOR \u00b6 1.a); that \nthe utility provider in SOR \u00b6 1.h was still trying to locate his account; and that he was still \ntrying to connect with the creditor in SOR \u00b6 1.f about that credit-card debt that he now \nbelieves has not been paid. Applicant added that it was going to take some time to address \nhis debts, but that he is \u201con top of it.\u201d (AE B.) Applicant understands that he has to repay \nthe ambulance debt (SOR \u00b6 1.b), but he believes the ambulance company should be held \naccountable because the ambulance broke down on the highway when he was having a \nheart attack. (Tr. 45-46.) He acknowledges that he has made no payment on the credit- \ncard debt in collection with the entity in SOR \u00b6 1.i. (Tr. 72.) \n \nApplicant\u2019s son currently attends a community college. Applicant cashed in his life \ninsurance policy of $26,000 to pay his son\u2019s tuition. Applicant gives his son about $100 a \nweek for his college expenses. (Tr. 32-33.) \n \nApplicant\u2019s current salary with the defense contractor is $75,000. He has earned \nbonuses annually of about $2,500. (Tr. 35-36.) He estimates that he owes approximately \n$5,000 in medical bills as a result of his accident. He also will have some medical bills for a \nprocedure in January 2019, although he expects them to be minimal because he has \nmedical insurance. (Tr. 52-54.) He returned to work the day following the procedure. (Tr. \n54.) For the most part, he lives from paycheck to paycheck. When he has extra money, he \ntries to pay off debts. (Tr. 76.) As of his hearing in February 2019, he had about $9 in his \nchecking account. (Tr. 79.) His spouse receives about $900 a month in Social Security \nDisability income. (Tr. 82.) Applicant and his spouse pay $1,800 per month in rent. (Tr. 83.) \n \nPolicies \n \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion the Executive \nBranch has in regulating access to information pertaining to national security,  emphasizing \nthat \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 \nU.S. 518, 528 (1988). When evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, \nthe administrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are required to be considered in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. These guidelines \nare not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, \nthese guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative \nprocess. The administrative judge\u2019s overall adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious \nscrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative \njudge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, \nfavorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \n\n7 \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence \nto establish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant \nis responsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation about potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Section 7 of EO 10865 \nprovides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a \ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section \n3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information). \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \n \n \nThe security concerns about financial considerations are articulated in AG \u00b6 18: \n \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness \nto abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about an \nindividual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified or \nsensitive information. Financial distress can also be caused or exacerbated \nby, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other issues of personnel security \nconcern such as excessive gambling, mental health conditions, substance \nmisuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An individual who is financially \noverextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or otherwise \nquestionable acts to generate funds. . . . \n \n \nThe Appeal Board explained the scope and rationale for the financial considerations \nsecurity concern in ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012) (citation omitted) \nas follows: \n \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an applicant might knowingly \ncompromise classified information in order to raise money in satisfaction of \nhis or her debts. Rather, it requires a Judge to examine the totality of an \n\n8 \n \napplicant\u2019s financial history and circumstances. The Judge must consider \npertinent evidence regarding the applicant\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other \nqualities essential to protecting the national secrets as well as the \nvulnerabilities inherent in the circumstances. The Directive presumes a \nnexus between proven conduct under any of the Guidelines and an \napplicant\u2019s security eligibility. \n \nAvailable credit information establishes that Applicant incurred the delinquencies \nalleged in the SOR. It is unclear whether the mortgage delinquency is still owed. The debt \nwas on his credit report as $13,748 past due as of November 2017, but the information \nabout the delinquency was from April 2014. Applicant testified that the house was sold for \nmore than what he paid for it, although he provided no proof of the sale. Even so, he does \nnot dispute that he stopped paying on the mortgage loan and lost the house. His record of \ndelinquent accounts establishes disqualifying conditions AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a), \u201cinability to satisfy \ndebts,\u201d and 19(c), \u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations.\u201d \n \nThe applicability of the aforesaid disqualifying conditions shifts the burden to \nApplicant to demonstrate that one or more of the following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 \n20 applies: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under \nsuch circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the \nindividual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem from a \nlegitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit counseling service, \nand there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under \ncontrol; \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(a) applies only in that some of the debts first became delinquent more than \nfive years ago. Applicant stopped paying on the credit cards in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c and 1.e and the \nsnowmobile loan in 2012. The ambulance debt (SOR \u00b6 1.b) is from February 2013. His last \n\n9 \n \npayment on the mortgage loan (SOR \u00b6 1.g) was in July 2013. However, his failure to \naddress these past-due debts constitutes continuing conduct of security concern that is not \nmitigated under AG \u00b6 20(a). The satellite-television debt in SOR \u00b6 1.a, the credit-card debt \nin SOR \u00b6 1.i, and the utility debt in SOR \u00b6 1.h, which are all from 2015, and the credit-card \ndelinquency in SOR \u00b6 1.e from 2016, are evidence of recent financial problems that cast \ndoubt on his judgment and reliability and are not mitigated by AG \u00b6 20(a).  \n \n \nApplicant has a case for some mitigation under AG \u00b6 20(b). The debts that became \ndelinquent in 2012 and 2013 were caused by the failure of his business. Applicant could \nnot control economic conditions in his area or the decisions of others (his brother and his \nbiggest customer) that led to a significant loss of business for his company and the \nconsequent decline in his income. Even so, in starting his own business, Applicant took a \nrisk that it may not be financially profitable. The ambulance debt resulted from a medical \nemergency, which is a circumstance contemplated within AG \u00b6 20(b). Regarding those \naccounts that became delinquent in 2015 or 2016, it is unclear what was transpiring that \ncaused him to fall behind so seriously on his utility costs or to cease paying in July 2015 on \nthe credit card placed with the collection entity in SOR \u00b6 1.i and in November 2016 on the \ncredit card in SOR \u00b6 1.f. \n \n \nEven if Applicant\u2019s financial difficulties initially arose, in whole or in part, due to \ncircumstances outside of his control, I have to consider whether Applicant acted in a \nreasonable manner when dealing with his financial difficulties. See ISCR Case No. 05-\n11366 at 4 n.9 (App. Bd. Jan. 12, 2007) (citing ISCR Case No. 99-0462 at 4 (App. Bd. May \n25, 2000); ISCR Case No. 99-0012 at 4 (App. Bd. Dec. 1, 1999); ISCR Case No. 03-13096 \nat 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 29, 2005)). A component of good financial management is whether an \nindividual maintains contact with his or her creditors and attempts in good faith to arrange \nfor repayment. In that regard, Applicant\u2019s evidence falls considerably short of showing any \nongoing contact with his creditors. He claims that he paid the $131 satellite-television debt \na couple of years ago, but his November 2017 credit report shows the debt as unpaid. The \ncellphone and cable bills that were settled in November 2017 were his spouse\u2019s debts. \nEven though Applicant may reasonably be excused from addressing his delinquent \naccounts while he was out of work for eight months following his serious motorcycle \naccident in 2018, he has known since his August 2015 SF 86 that his delinquencies were \nof concern to the DOD, and he was not proactive about his debts after he returned to work. \nAlthough he had medical treatment in January 2019, he apparently returned to work the \nfollowing day. He had a hearing for September 2018 that was rescheduled, and yet he \ninexplicably took little action before his February 2019 hearing to address the issues that \nhave been of concern to the DOD for several years. \n \nNeither AG \u00b6 20(c) nor AG \u00b6 20(d) has been shown to fully apply without a track \nrecord of repayment. There is no evidence that Applicant is being pursued for any \ndeficiency on the delinquent mortgage loan. Abandonment of a financial obligation is not a \ngood-faith effort to resolve a debt. Applicant presented no documentation to establish that \nthe debt was resolved through a foreclosure sale that could mitigate the debt under AG \u00b6 \n20(e). Even if that debt is no longer owed, his other past-due debts total more than \n$30,000, which is a significant debt burden for Applicant, who is living largely from \n\n10 \n \npaycheck to paycheck. Promises to pay a debt at some future date are not a substitute for \nfinancially responsible behavior. The Appeal Board has held that applicants who only begin \nto address their financial issues when their personal interests are at stake may not comply \nwith laws, rules, and regulations when their immediate interests are not imperiled. See \nISCR Case No. 17-01382 (App. Bd. May 16, 2018) and ISCR Case No. 16-01211 (App. \nBd. May 30, 2018). Applicant lacks a documented track record of timely payments that \ncould alleviate the concerns for his financial judgment. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \nIn assessing the whole person, the administrative judge must consider the totality of \nan applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant circumstances in light of the nine adjudicative \nprocess factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). The analysis under Guideline F is incorporated in my whole-\nperson analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were addressed under that guideline, but \nsome warrant additional comment. \n \n \nThe security clearance adjudication involves an evaluation of an applicant\u2019s \njudgment, reliability, and trustworthiness in light of the security guidelines in the Directive. \nSee ISCR Case No. 09-02160 (App. Bd. Jun. 21, 2010). It is not a proceeding designed to \ncollect debts. Applicant has worked for his employer since July 2015, and I have no reason \nto doubt his assertion that he is dedicated to his duties. He indicates that he will continue to \nclean up his credit. Had he not waited until February and March 2019 to take action, he \nwould perhaps have been in a better position to demonstrate that he has established a \nplan to resolve his financial problems and taken significant actions to implement it.  \n \n \nThe Appeal Board has repeatedly held that the government need not wait until an \napplicant mishandles or fails to safeguard classified information before denying or revoking \nsecurity clearance eligibility. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 08-09918 (App. Bd. Oct. 29, 2009) \n(citing Adams v. Laird, 420 F.2d 230, 238-239 (D.C. Cir. 1969)). It is well settled that once \na concern arises regarding an applicant\u2019s security clearance eligibility, there is a strong \npresumption against the grant or renewal of a security clearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, \n913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th Cir. 1990). For the reasons noted, I am unable to conclude that \nit is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue security clearance \neligibility for Applicant. \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.i: \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n\n11 \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances, it not is clearly consistent with the national \ninterest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance. Eligibility for \naccess to classified information is denied. \n \n \n_____________________ \nElizabeth M. Matchinski \nAdministrative Judge \n",

Eligibility for a security clearance and \naccess to classified information is denied. \nStatement of the Case \nOn May 15, 2015, Applicant applied for a security clearance and submitted an \nElectronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing (e-QIP). On December 23, 2016, \nthe Department of Defense (DOD) Consolidated Adjudications Facility (CAF) issued a \nStatement of Reasons (SOR) to him under Executive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended and \nmodified; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance \nReview Program (January 2, 1992), as amended and modified (Directive); and the \nAdjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility For Access to Classified Information \n(December 29, 2005) applicable to all adjudications and other determinations made under \nthe Directive, effective September 1, 2006.1  \n01/24/2019\n\n \n2 \n                                      \n \nThe SOR alleged security concerns under Guidelines E (Personal Conduct), J \n(Criminal Conduct), and F (Financial Considerations), and detailed reasons why the DOD \nCAF was unable to make an affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant. \nThe SOR recommended referral to an administrative judge to determine whether such \neligibility should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked.  \n \n \nApplicant received the SOR on January 10, 2017. In a sworn statement, dated \nJanuary 30, 2017,2 Applicant responded to the SOR allegations and requested a hearing \nbefore an administrative judge. Department Counsel indicated the Government was \nprepared to proceed on March 8, 2017. The case was assigned to me on March 20, 2018. \nA Notice of Hearing was issued on August 28, 2018, scheduling the hearing for \nSeptember 24, 2018. I convened the hearing as scheduled. \n \n \nDuring the hearing, Government exhibits (GE) 1 through GE 7 and Administrative \nExhibit I were admitted into evidence without objection. No Applicant exhibits (AE) were \noffered. Applicant testified. The transcript (Tr.) was received on January 17, 2019.3 I kept \nthe record open to enable Applicant to supplement it. He took advantage of that \nopportunity and timely submitted several documents, which were marked and admitted \nas AE A through AE O, without objection. The record closed on October 29, 2018. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nIn his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted, with limited comments, nearly all of \nthe factual allegations pertaining to personal conduct in the SOR (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a. through \n1.d., and 1.f.); he failed to admit or deny one allegation pertaining to personal conduct \n(SOR \u00b6 1.e.), so a denial was registered for him; he admitted, with limited comments, \nnearly all of the factual allegations pertaining to criminal conduct (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.a. through \n2.c.); he failed to admit or deny one allegation pertaining to criminal conduct (SOR \u00b6 2.d.), \nso a denial was registered for him; and he admitted several allegations pertaining to \nfinancial considerations (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 3.i. through 3.n.). He denied, with limited comments, all \nof the remaining allegations.  \n \nDuring the hearing, Department Counsel moved to amend the SOR by adding \neight additional factual allegations pertaining to financial considerations (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 3.o. \n                                                          \n1 Effective June 8, 2017, by Directive 4 of the Security Executive Agent (SEAD 4), dated December \n10, 2016, National Security Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) for all covered individuals who require initial or \ncontinued eligibility for access to classified information or eligibility to hold a sensitive position, were \nestablished to supersede all previously issued national security adjudicative criteria or guidelines. \nAccordingly, those guidelines previously implemented on September 1, 2006, under which this security \nclearance review case was initiated, no longer apply. In comparing the two versions, there is no substantial \ndifference that might have a negative effect on Applicant in this case. \n \n2 Although the pre-printed form upon which Applicant selected the chosen forum was dated 2016, \nit is clear that if the SOR was issued in December 2016, he could not have received it in January 2016. \n \n3 Although a copy of the purported transcript was received on October 2, 2018, while the cover of \nthe transcript was the one for this case, the contents were associated with a different case. Upon \ndetermining the error, the correct transcript was electronically transmitted to me on January 17, 2019. \n\n \n3 \n                                      \n \nthrough 3.v.). There being no objection, the motion was granted.4 Applicant was afforded \n20 days to respond to the new allegations. He failed to admit or deny any of the added \nallegations pertaining to financial considerations, so denials were registered for him. \n \nApplicant\u2019s admissions and comments are incorporated herein as findings of fact. \nAfter a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, and upon due \nconsideration of same, I make the following additional findings of fact:  \n \nApplicant is a 38-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has been serving \nas a missile assembler with his current employer since October 2004. Although he \nattended high school for six years, in 2000, he received a certificate of completion, but \nnot a diploma. He has never served in the U.S. military. He was granted a secret \nclearance in 2004. Applicant has never married, but he has resided with a cohabitant for \nan unspecified period, and he had four children, born in 2002, 2004, 2008, and 2015, \nrespectively. \n \nPersonal Conduct and Criminal Conduct \n \n \nApplicant has a lengthy history of disregarding laws, rules, and regulations. The \nSOR alleged nine incidents of criminality and personal conduct by Applicant commencing \nin 2006, and continuing until at least 2016.  \n \n(SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a. and 3.n.): In June 2006, Applicant was charged with 1) Driving with \nSuspended License, 2) Operating a Vehicle without Insurance, and 3) Switched Tag. He \nwas convicted and fined.5 He was granted a payment plan. While he paid $35 associated \nwith the Switched Tag conviction, he failed to pay the remaining $256 for that charge, and \nthe $306 and $356 for the other charges.6 \n \n \n(SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b. and 3.n.): In July 2012, Applicant was charged with 1) Driving while \nLicense Suspended, and 2) Operating a Vehicle without Insurance. He was convicted \nand fined.7 He was granted a payment plan. While he paid $356 for the Insurance charge, \nand $244 associated with the Suspended License conviction, he failed to pay the \nremaining $62 for that charge.8  \n \n(SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c. and 3.n.): In July 2013, Applicant was charged with 1) Driving with \nLicense Revoked, 2) Operating a Vehicle without Insurance, and 3) Expired Tag. He was \n                                                          \n4 Tr. at 12-14. \n \n5 GE 6 (Municipal Record Search, dated October 21, 2016). \n \n6 Applicant\u2019s Answer to the SOR, supra note 1.  \n \n7 GE 6, supra note 5. \n \n8 GE 6, supra note 5. \n \n\n \n4 \n                                      \n \nconvicted and fined.9 He was granted a payment plan. His fines of $306 for the Revoked \nLicense, $356 for the Insurance, and $206 for the Expired Tag remain unpaid.10  \n \n(SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.a. and 3.n.): In October 2013, Applicant was charged with Contempt of \nCourt associated with his failures to pay his outstanding fines. In March 2014, after he \npaid $35 in fees and court costs, the charge was nolle prossed.11  \n \n(SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d., 1.f., and 3.n.): In January 2014, Applicant was arrested and charged \nwith 1) Driving with License Revoked, 2) Failure/Refusal to Display Insurance, and \nExpired Tag. He was convicted and fined.12 He was granted a payment plan. His $306 \nfine for Revoked License, $356 fine for Insurance, and his $206 fine for Expired Tag \nremain unpaid.13 Applicant failed to self-report his arrest to his security manager of facility \nsecurity office.14 \n \n(SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.b. and 3.n.): In September 2014, Applicant was again charged with \nContempt of Court associated with his failures to pay his outstanding fines. In November \n2014, a warrant was issued for his arrest. He was eventually ordered to pay $303 in fees \nand court costs, but that amount remains unpaid.15  \n \n(SOR \u00b6 1.g.): In December 2015, a coworker brought a shocking pen into the work \narea. Applicant took the device from the coworker and entered another work area where \nhe attempted to \u201cprank\u201d another employee. Human Resources determined that Applicant \nhad conspired to be untruthful in an interview when he was questioned about his level of \ninvolvement in the incident. Applicant was subsequently issued a written warning for \nfailure to comply with the company\u2019s guidelines for professional conduct.16 Applicant \ndenied both the allegation and taking the device into the work area, claiming the incident \nwas incorrectly reported.17 \n \n(SOR \u00b6 2.c.): Although he is aware that it is illegal to operate a motor vehicle \nwithout a driver\u2019s license, when he is unable to obtain transportation to and from work \n                                                          \n9 GE 6, supra note 5. \n \n10 GE 6, supra note 5. \n \n11 GE 6, supra note 5. \n \n12 GE 6, supra note 5. \n \n13 GE 6, supra note 5. \n \n14 Applicant\u2019s Answer to the SOR, supra note 1. \n \n15 GE 6, supra note 5. \n \n16 GE 5 (Incident History, dated September 29, 2016). \n \n17 Applicant\u2019s Answer to the SOR, supra note 1; Tr. at 74-76. \n \n\n \n5 \n                                      \n \nwith a coworker, to avoid being fired from his job, Applicant admitted that he takes the \nrisk and has continued to drive unlawfully since his 2014 arrest.18 \n \nFinancial Considerations19 \n  \nApplicant attributed his financial difficulties to several factors: he is a single father; \nhe and his children reside with Applicant\u2019s grandmother \u2013 the individual who raised him \n\u2013 in her house; his girlfriend refused to allow him to get a tag for the vehicle in her name \nfor which he had cosigned; and in 2012, his girlfriend left him and the children. Although \nnot cited by him as a contributing factor to his financial problems, three or four years ago, \nfor Christmas, Applicant purchased an unspecified number of all-terrain-vehicles (ATVs) \nfor his children, each costing $5,000 to $6,000.20 For reasons not explained other than \nexperiencing \u201crough times,\u201d in addition to the traffic fines and fees that remain unpaid, \nother accounts became delinquent.  \nThe SOR, as amended, identified 21 purportedly delinquent accounts, including \nunpaid court fines and fees, which had been placed for collection, charged off, or filed as \njudgments, as generally reflected by Applicant\u2019s December 2010, June 2016, or \nSeptember 2018 credit reports. Those debts total approximately $48,677. The current \nstatus of the non-court fines and fees accounts is as follows: \nThere are six delinquent accounts that were placed for collection and filed as \njudgments that were eventually partially or fully satisfied by garnishments: $5,028 (SOR \n\u00b6\u00b6 3.c. and 3.l.); $1,048 (SOR \u00b6 3.d.); $1,400 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 3.e. and 3.m.); $1,025 (SOR \u00b6 \n3.f.); $5,064 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 3.g. and 3.i.); and $1,149 (SOR \u00b6 3.h.).21 There has been no change \nin the status of a vast majority of Applicant\u2019s accounts that were placed for collection, \nmost of which were charged off with unpaid balances: $4,787 (SOR \u00b6 3.a.); $374 (SOR \n\u00b6 3.b.); $2,167 (SOR \u00b6 3.o.); $1,385 (SOR \u00b6 3.p.); $2,088 (SOR \u00b6 3.q.); $9,073 (SOR \u00b6 \n3.r.); $6,154 (SOR \u00b6 3.s.); $418 (SOR \u00b6 3.t.); $175 (SOR \u00b6 3.u.); and $714 (SOR \u00b6 3.v.).22 \n                                                          \n18 GE 2 (Personal Subject Interview, dated May 18, 2016), at 3; Applicant\u2019s Answer to the SOR, \nsupra note 1; Tr. at 72. \n \n19 General source information pertaining to the financial issues discussed below can be found in \nthe following exhibits: GE 2, supra note 18; GE 3 (Combined Experian, TransUnion, and Equifax Credit \nReport, dated December 30, 2010); GE 4 (Equifax Credit Report, dated June 28, 2016); GE 7 (Equifax \nCredit Report, dated September 21, 2018); and Applicant\u2019s Answer to the SOR, supra note 1.   \n  \n20 Tr. at 56-57. \n \n21 GE 3, supra note 19; GE 4, supra note 19; GE 7, supra note 19; AE A (Garnishment File, various \ndates); AE B (Satisfaction of Judgment, dated October 16, 2018); AE C (Garnishment File, various dates); \nAE D Civil Fee Sheet, dated September 28, 2018); AE E (Garnishment File, various dates); AE F (Order, \ndated May 27, 2010); AE G (Order, dated June 9, 2009); AE H (Garnishment File, various dates); AE I (Civil \nFee Sheet, dated September 28, 2018); AE J (Garnishment File, various dates).

He reported that his monthly net salary was about $2,731.80, and his monthly \nexpenses, including $500 child support, and $600 for debt relief and credit cards, was \n$2,450.24 That leaves him approximately $282 per month available for discretionary \nsaving or spending. There is no evidence of financial counseling. \nPolicies \n \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the Executive \nBranch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security emphasizing, \n\u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d25 As Commander in Chief, the President has \nthe authority to control access to information bearing on national security and to \ndetermine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such \ninformation. The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to \ngrant an applicant eligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that \nit is clearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d26   \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the guidelines in SEAD 4. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the guidelines list potentially disqualifying \nconditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility \nfor access to classified information. \n \nAn administrative judge need not view the guidelines as inflexible, ironclad rules \nof law. Instead, acknowledging the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. The entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known \nas the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \n                                                          \n \n23 Tr. at 48-52. \n \n24 AE N (Personal Financial Statement, undated). \n \n25 Department of the Navy v.

Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as \namended and modified.    \n \n\n \n7 \n                                      \n \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a meaningful decision. \n \nIn the decision-making process, facts must be established by \u201csubstantial \nevidence.\u201d27 The Government initially has the burden of producing evidence to establish \na potentially disqualifying condition under the Directive, and has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Once the Government has produced \nsubstantial evidence of a disqualifying condition, under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant \nhas the burden of persuasion to present evidence in refutation, explanation, extenuation \nor mitigation, sufficient to overcome the doubts raised by the Government\u2019s case. The \nburden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government.28  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours as well. It is \nbecause of this special relationship that the Government must be able to repose a high \ndegree of trust and confidence in those individuals to whom it grants access to classified \ninformation. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the \napplicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. Such \ndecisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather \nthan actual, risk of compromise of classified information.  Furthermore, \u201csecurity \nclearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d29  \n \nClearance decisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense \nbe a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d30 Thus, nothing in this \ndecision should be construed to suggest that I have based this decision, in whole or in \npart, on any express or implied determination as to Applicant\u2019s allegiance, loyalty, or \npatriotism. It is merely an indication the Applicant has or has not met the strict guidelines \nthe President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a clearance.  In \nreaching this decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, \nand based on the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing \ninferences grounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \n \n \n                                                          \n27 \u201cSubstantial evidence [is] such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as \nadequate to support a conclusion in light of all contrary evidence in the record.\u201d  ISCR Case No. 04-11463 \nat 2 (App. Bd.

Or. 10865 \u00a7 7. \n \n\n \n8 \n                                      \n \nAnalysis \n \nUpon consideration of all the facts in evidence, including those in the DOD CAF \ncase file, those submitted by Applicant, his testimony, as well as an assessment of \nApplicant=s demeanor and credibility, and after application of all appropriate legal \nprecepts and factors, I conclude the following with respect to the allegations set forth in \nthe SOR: \n \nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Criminal Conduct is set out in AG \n\u00b6 30: Criminal activity creates doubt about a person's judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person's ability or willingness to \ncomply with laws, rules, and regulations. \n \nThe guideline notes conditions under AG \u00b6 31 that could raise security concerns: \n \n(a) a pattern of minor offenses, any one of which on its own would be \nunlikely to affect a national security eligibility decision, but which in \ncombination cast doubt on the individual's judgment, reliability, or \ntrustworthiness; and \n \n(b) evidence (including, but not limited to, a credible allegation, an \nadmission, and matters of official record) of criminal conduct, regardless of \nwhether the individual was formally charged, prosecuted, or convicted.  \n \nBetween 2006 and 2014, Applicant established a lengthy pattern of criminality \ninvolving repeated traffic-related violations for which he was charged, convicted, and \nfined. His repeated failures to pay his court fines and costs resulted in two charges of \ncontempt of court. Although he is aware that it is illegal to operate a motor vehicle without \na driver\u2019s license, Applicant admitted that he takes the risk and has continued to drive \nunlawfully since his 2014 arrest. Based on the actions described above, AG \u00b6\u00b6 31(a) and \n31(b) have been established. \n \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions under AG \u00b6 32 that could \nmitigate trustworthiness concerns arising from criminal conduct. They include: \n \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur and \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment;  \n \n(c) no reliable evidence to support that the individual committed the offense;  \nand  \n \n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including, but not limited \nto, the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, restitution, \n\n \n9 \n                                      \n \ncompliance with the terms of parole or probation, job training or higher \neducation, \ngood \nemployment \nrecord, \nor \nconstructive \ncommunity \ninvolvement. \n \nNone of the mitigating conditions apply. Applicant\u2019s continuing unwillingness to \ncomply with laws, rules, and regulations is troubling, for he routinely ignores the law when \nhe consistently drives a vehicle without a license, when it has been suspended or \nrevoked, without insurance, or with an expired or switched tag. Under these \ncircumstances, there is little, if any, evidence of rehabilitation. While a person should not \nbe held forever accountable for misconduct from the past, in this instance, the criminal \nconduct is routinely continuing. Given his cavalier attitude towards laws, rules, and \nregulations, Applicant\u2019s history of criminal conduct, under the circumstances, continues \nto cast doubt on his reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment. \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Personal Conduct is set out in \nAG \u00b6 15: \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. The following will normally result in \nan unfavorable national security eligibility determination, security clearance \naction, or cancellation of further processing for national security eligibility: \n \n(a) refusal, or failure without reasonable cause, to undergo or \ncooperate with security processing, including but not limited \nto meeting with a security investigator for subject interview, \ncompleting security forms or releases, cooperation with \nmedical \nor \npsychological \nevaluation, \nor \npolygraph \nexamination, if authorized and required; and \n \n(b) refusal to provide full, frank, and truthful answers to lawful \nquestions of investigators, security officials, or other official \nrepresentatives in connection with a personnel security or \ntrustworthiness determination. \n \nThe guideline also includes an example of a condition that could raise security \nconcerns under AG \u00b6 16: \n \n(c) credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is \nnot sufficient for an adverse determination under any other single guideline, \nbut which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-person \nassessment of questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack \n\n \n10 \n                                      \n \nof candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations, or other \ncharacteristics indicating that the individual may not properly safeguard \nclassified or sensitive information. \n \nMy discussion related to Applicant\u2019s criminal conduct is adopted herein. In addition, \nApplicant failed to self-report his 2014 arrest to his security manager or his facility security \noffice. Applicant\u2019s continuing unwillingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations is \ntroubling. With respect to the incidents of criminal-personal conduct discussed above, and \nApplicant\u2019s failure to report his 2014 arrest, AG \u00b6 16(c) has been established. As to the \nalleged conduct, denied by Applicant, regarding his failure to comply with the corporate \nguidelines for professional conduct in December 2015, while further commentary appears \nbelow, AG \u00b6 16(c) has been established. \n \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions under AG \u00b6 17 that could \nmitigate security concerns arising from personal conduct. They include: \n \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; and \n \n(e) The information was unsubstantiated or from a source of questionable \nreliability. \n \nBecause of Applicant\u2019s continuing unwillingness to comply with laws, rules, and \nregulations, especially related to the unlawful driving issues, as well as his failures to pay \nthe court-assessed fines and costs, AG \u00b6 17(c) does not apply. While Applicant failed to \nself-report his 2014 arrest, he claimed that he was unaware that the incident was \nsupposed to be reported. There is no evidence that Applicant had been informed of his \nresponsibility to report it.  \n \nWith respect to the alleged incident of Applicant\u2019s failure to comply with the \ncorporate guidelines for professional conduct, guidelines which were not entered into \nevidence, in December 2015, as noted above, Applicant denied the allegation and the \nfacts underlying it. The only evidence of the alleged incident or the facts reported, are \nfound in a Joint Personnel Adjudication System (JPAS) Person Summary, called an \nIncident History, written by an unidentified individual, with no indicia of accuracy or \nverification. It does not appear to be an investigative report, and is unverified hearsay. \nGiven Applicant\u2019s denial of the allegation in its entirety, acceptable evidence of the alleged \nincident, at least in the form of an official corporate incident report, report of inquiry, or \nsome other verified document signed by a corporate executive or government official \nshould have been submitted. In the absence of such evidence, as to this allegation, AG \n\u00b6 17(e) applies. Nevertheless, Applicant\u2019s actions under the circumstances continue to \ncast doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. \n \n \n\n \n11 \n                                      \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG \u00b6 18:  \n      \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19:  \n \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; \n \n(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so;  \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \n \n(e) consistent spending beyond one\u2019s means or frivolous or irresponsible \nspending, which may be indicated by excessive indebtedness, significant \nnegative cash flow, a history of late payments or of non-payment, or other \nnegative financial indicators. \n \nThe SOR, as amended, identified 21 delinquent accounts, including unpaid court \nfines and fees, that had been placed for collection, charged off, or filed as judgments, \ntotaling approximately $48,677. There is no evidence that he was unwilling to satisfy his \ndebts or that he had the ability to do so, but with the purchase of one or more ATVs for \nhis children, each costing $5,000 to $6,000, there is evidence of frivolous or irresponsible \nspending, or consistent spending beyond his means, especially when he had numerous \ndelinquent accounts and unpaid court fines and fees. There has been no change in the \nstatus of a vast majority of Applicant\u2019s delinquent accounts. AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a), 19(c), and 19(e) \nhave been established, but AG \u00b6 19(b) has not been established.  \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns arising from financial difficulties under AG \u00b6 20: \n \n\n \n12 \n                                      \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;31 \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control;  \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts;32 and \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue. \n \nNone of the mitigation conditions apply. The conditions that supposedly resulted in \nApplicant\u2019s financial problems were of his own making, not the result of conditions that \nwere largely beyond his control. The somewhat rare instances of his paying court fines \nand fees do not constitute a \u201cgood-faith\u201d effort to resolve his debts, and neither does the \nresolution of judgments by garnishment. Applicant claimed he hired a debt relief \norganization to resolve his debts. But, as noted above, he failed to submit documentation \n                                                          \n31 A debt that became delinquent several years ago is still considered recent because \u201can \napplicant\u2019s ongoing, unpaid debts evidence a continuing course of conduct and, therefore, can be viewed \nas recent for purposes of the Guideline F mitigating conditions.\u201d ISCR Case No. 15-06532 at 3 (App. Bd. \nFeb. 16, 2017) (citing ISCR Case No. 15-01690 at 2 (App. Bd. Sept. 13, 2016)). \n \n32 The Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a good-faith effort to repay overdue \ncreditors or otherwise resolve debts: \n \nIn order to qualify for application of [the \u201cgood-faith\u201d mitigating condition], an applicant must \npresent evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or some \nother good-faith action aimed at resolving the applicant\u2019s debts. The Directive does not \ndefine the term \u201cgood-faith.\u201d However, the Board has indicated that the concept of good-\nfaith \u201crequires a showing that a person acts in a way that shows reasonableness, prudence, \nhonesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.\u201d Accordingly, an applicant must do more than \nmerely show that he or she relied on a legally available option (such as bankruptcy [or \nstatute of limitations]) in order to claim the benefit of [the \u201cgood-faith\u201d mitigating condition].  \n \n(internal citation and footnote omitted) ISCR Case No. 02-30304 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2004) (quoting \nISCR Case No. 99-9020 at 5-6 (App. Bd. June 4, 2001)). \n \n\n \n13 \n                                      \n \nto support his claims. Although the record remained open, he also failed to furnish a \nrequested updated status of his SOR-related accounts supported by receipts, checks, or \nletters related to those debts; and a copy of his repayment plan showing any priority for \naddressing his delinquent accounts.  \nApplicant offered no documentation to indicate that he sought information from his \ncreditors or collection agents,33 or by obtaining financial counseling and credit resolution \nguidance and assistance. He offered evidence to indicate that his annual income is \nsufficient to address at least some of his delinquent accounts, but little evidence to \nindicate that his financial situation is now under control. Applicant\u2019s actions under the \ncircumstances continue to cast doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, and good \njudgment.34 \nClearance decisions are aimed at evaluating an applicant\u2019s judgment, reliability, \nand trustworthiness. They are not a debt-collection procedure. The guidelines do not \nrequire an applicant to establish resolution of every debt or issue alleged in the SOR. An \napplicant needs only to establish a plan to resolve financial problems and take significant \nactions to implement the plan. There is no requirement that an applicant immediately \nresolve issues or make payments on all delinquent debts simultaneously, nor is there a \nrequirement that the debts or issues alleged in an SOR be resolved first. Rather, a \nreasonable plan and concomitant conduct may provide for the payment of such debts, or \nresolution of such issues, one at a time. Mere promises to pay debts in the future, without \nfurther confirmed action, are insufficient. In this instance, Applicant\u2019s promises have not \ntransitioned into positive action. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a position of public trust by considering the totality of the \napplicant\u2019s conduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider \nthe nine adjudicative process factors listed at SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6 2(d): \n  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n                                                          \n33 \u201cEven if Applicant\u2019s financial difficulties initially arose, in whole or in part, due to circumstances \noutside his [or her] control, the Judge could still consider whether Applicant has since acted in a reasonable \nmanner when dealing with those financial difficulties.\u201d ISCR Case No. 05-11366 at 4 n.9 (App. Bd. Jan. 12, \n2007) (citing ISCR Case No. 99-0462 at 4 (App. Bd. May 25, 2000); ISCR Case No. 99-0012 at 4 (App. Bd. \nDec. 1, 1999); ISCR Case No. 03-13096 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 29, 2005)). A component is whether he or she \nmaintained contact with creditors and attempted to negotiate partial payments to keep debts current. \n \n34 See ISCR Case No. 09-08533 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Oct. 6, 2010). \n \n\n \n14 \n                                      \n \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nUnder SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. Moreover, I have \nevaluated the various aspects of this case in light of the totality of the record evidence \nand have not merely performed a piecemeal analysis.35 \n \n There is some evidence in favor of mitigating Applicant\u2019s conduct. Applicant is a \n38-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has been serving as a missile \nassembler with his current employer since October 2004. He was granted a secret \nclearance in 2004. \n \n \nThe disqualifying evidence under the whole-person concept is more substantial. \nApplicant is an individual with a history of criminal conduct and personal conduct incidents \ntaking place starting in 2006 and continuing through 2014. In fact, although he has not \nbeen caught by the police authorities since 2014, Applicant continues to show an \nunwillingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations, for he routinely ignores the law \nwhen he consistently drives a vehicle without a license, when it has been suspended or \nrevoked, without insurance, or with an expired or switched tag. Although he has been \nconvicted of numerous traffic-related violations and fined and assessed court fees, he \nhas generally ignored those fines and fees to the extent that he has twice been charged \nwith contempt of court. Judgments have been satisfied only through garnishments of his \nwages, not by mutually-agreed repayment plans. Although Applicant claimed to have \ntaken certain positive actions to address his creditors and delinquent accounts, he failed \nto submit requested documentation to support his various claims and contentions.  \n \n \nThe Appeal Board has addressed a key element in the whole-person analysis in \nfinancial cases stating:36 \n \nIn evaluating Guideline F cases, the Board has previously noted that the \nconcept of \u201cmeaningful track record\u201d necessarily includes evidence of actual \ndebt reduction through payment of debts. However, an applicant is not \nrequired, as a matter of law, to establish that he [or she] has paid off each \nand every debt listed in the SOR. All that is required is that an applicant \ndemonstrate that he [or she] has \u201c. . . established a plan to resolve his [or \nher] financial problems and taken significant actions to implement that plan.\u201d \nThe Judge can reasonably consider the entirety of an applicant\u2019s financial \nsituation and his [or her] actions in evaluating the extent to which that \napplicant\u2019s plan for the reduction of his outstanding indebtedness is credible \nand realistic. See Directive \u00b6 E2.2(a) (\u201cAvailable, reliable information about \n                                                          \n35 See U.S. v. Bottone, 365 F.2d 389, 392 (2d Cir. 1966); See also ISCR Case No. 03-22861 at 2-\n3 (App. Bd. Jun. 2, 2006). \n \n36 ISCR Case No. 07-06482 at 2-3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008) (internal citations omitted). \n \n\n \n15 \n                                      \n \nthe person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, should be \nconsidered in reaching a determination.\u201d) There is no requirement that a \nplan provide for payments on all outstanding debts simultaneously. Rather, \na reasonable plan (and concomitant conduct) may provide for the payment \nof such debts one at a time. Likewise, there is no requirement that the first \ndebts actually paid in furtherance of a reasonable debt plan be the ones \nlisted in the SOR. \n \nApplicant has demonstrated a poor track record of debt reduction and elimination \nefforts, essentially failing to address nearly all of his SOR-related debts. Overall, the \nevidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability \nfor a security clearance. For all of these reasons, I conclude Applicant has failed to \nmitigate the security concerns arising from his criminal conduct, personal conduct, and \nfinancial considerations. See SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6\u00b6 2(d)(1) through AG 2(d)(9). \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline E:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a. through 1.e.:  \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.f. and 1.g.: \n \nFor Applicant \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline J:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 2.a. through 2.d.:  \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nParagraph 3, Guideline F:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 3.a. and 3.b.: \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 3.c. through 3.m.:  \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraphs 3.n. through 3.v.:  \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \n In light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

The Statement of Reason (SOR) \nalleges Applicant provided false answers on forms applying for a security clearance. The \nissue is whether his 2011 termination, his two responses on a 2014 Electronic \nQuestionnaires for Investigations Processing (e-QIP), and his single response on a 2003 \nSecurity Clearance Application, Standard Form (SF) 86 raise concerns about his fitness \nto hold a security clearance. He has mitigated the personal conduct security concerns. \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information is granted.  \n \nStatement of the Case \n \n \nOn October 5, 2017, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications \nFacility (DoD CAF) issued an SOR to Applicant, detailing the security concerns under \nGuideline E, personal conduct, and explaining why it was unable to find it clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue security clearance eligibility for \nhim.  \n \n\n \n2 \n \nThe DoD CAF took the action under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DoD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility \nfor Access to Classified Information (AG) effective within the DoD on June 8, 2017. \n \nOn October 24, 2017, Applicant answered the SOR allegations and requested a \nhearing before an administrative judge from the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals \n(DOHA). On November 26, 2018, DOHA issued a Notice of Hearing scheduling a hearing \nthat was conducted on December 12, 2018.  \n \nEleven Government exhibits (Ex. 1-11) and two Applicant exhibits (Ex. A and B) \nwere admitted into evidence without objection. Documents submitted by Applicant as \nattachments to his SOR answer were also considered. Applicant testified, as reflected in \na transcript (Tr.) received on January 2, 2019. I held the record open after the hearing for \nApplicant to submit additional documents. On January 23, 2019, Applicant submitted a \nNovember 2017 e-QIP that was admitted without objection as Ex. C. \n \n \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nIn Applicant\u2019s answer to the SOR, he admitted he left employment with a company \nover educational requirements and admitted he incorrectly answered questions on his e-\nQIP, but denied he intentionally falsified his answers. He indicated his failures to disclose \ninformation was due to misunderstandings and a false impression of his circumstances. \nAt the hearing, he admitted he completed the e-QIP faster that he should have. (Tr. 80) \nAfter a thorough review of the pleadings and exhibits, I make the following findings of fact: \nApplicant is a 46-year-old senior engineer who has worked for a defense contractor \nsince November 2017. (Ex. 2) From June 1991 to June 1997, he honorably served in the \nU.S. Army working on aircraft electrical and armament systems. (Tr. 23) While in the \nArmy, he attended a six-month electronic aviation course. (Tr. 34) He married in \nNovember 2017 and has no children. (Tr. 24)  \nApplicant testified that in 1991, at age 18, five months after joining the Army, he \nattended a party, met, and spent the night with a female Marine. The next day, he was \ninformed he was being charged with rape. Applicant later learned the woman was not \nfully aware of the seriousness of the charges and decided to drop the charges. (Tr. 57) \nAlthough charged by civil authorities with rape, the charges were nolle prosequied. \nNo disciplinary action was taken by the civilian or military authorities after the allegations \nwere dropped. (Tr. 25) Applicant appeared in court with his drill sergeant. The district \nattorney said the charges had been dropped and there was nothing to prosecute. \nApplicant\u2019s court appearance lasted five minutes. He was not asked any questions during \nthe court proceeding nor was he informed the charge was a felony. (Tr. 27) \nWhen Applicant completed his August 2004 SF 86, he answered \u201cno\u201d when asked \nif he had ever been charged with or convicted of a felony offense. (Ex. 1) He answered \n\n \n3 \nas he did because, \u201cI assumed that . . . somebody made a false allegation and it went to \ncourt and nothing happened.\u201d (Ex. 3, Tr. 40) He now understands that similar questions \non security forms requires an affirmative answer. (Tr. 41) He admits he went through the \nquestionnaire faster than he should have due in part to his work load. (Tr. 44, Tr. 80) \nWhen he completed his November 2017 e-QIP, he indicated he was \u201caccused of rape, \nbut charges were dropped by accuser and the state said there was no evidence to file \ncharges or continue the case.\u201d` (Ex. C) \nApplicant had two Enhanced Subject Interviews. One in December 2014 focused \non his 1991 arrest and the other, in June 2016, focused on his 2011 termination. In his \n2014 interview, Applicant explained that he had been charged with rape in 1991, was \ntaken to the police station, and then released. (Ex. 3) He said he went to court with this \ndrill sergeant. The charges were dropped and no further action was taken. (Ex. 3) He said \nhe did not list the incident because the charges were dropped and he was told there would \nbe no record of the incident because the charges were dropped. (Ex. 3)  \nApplicant asserted the first chance he had to correct the information was during \nhis December 2014 interview. (Tr. 80) During the interview, he corrected and thoroughly \nexplained his actions. At the hearing, he asserted it was never his intent to deceive the \nGovernment, and he has done what he could to remedy the mistake (Tr. 80)  \nAfter leaving the military, Applicant was working at an aircraft company when fellow \ntechnicians told him that military courses would be accepted for college credits at a \nuniversity. In 1996, he enrolled at the university. (Tr. 30) In February 2002, he graduated \nfrom the university after completing a series of correspondence courses over a six-year \nperiod. (Ex. 7, Tr. 29, 30) The correspondence course were received in the mail and \ncompleted. This was prior to correspondence courses being routinely done through the \ninternet. (Tr. 72) The correspondence courses he took with the university were similar in \nnature to the correspondence courses he took while he was in the military. (Ex. 7, Tr. 31) \nSome of the 24 courses listed on his university transcript were courses taken while he \nwas on active duty. He was unaware of any accreditation problem with the university until \ninformed by his employer. (Tr. 37)  \nIn 2006, Applicant started working at company X. (Tr. 41) While working at the \ncompany, the company had enough confidence in him to promote him to a management \nposition. (Tr. 68) In July 2011, after being employed for six years, he was terminated by \nhis employer. The company\u2019s stated reason for termination was he had stated he had an \nElectrical Engineering (Bachelors) Degree from \u201cX\u2019 University on his employment \napplication. (Ex. 8) The company had learned the university was not licensed or \naccredited. He was unaware of any accreditation problems with the university until \ninformed by his employer. (Tr. 37)  \nThe company stated: \n \nIt has come to our attention that you do not have a Bachelor\u2019s Degree from \na licensed and authorized educational institution. You indicated on your \nemployment application that you had an Electrical Engineering degree from \n\n \n4 \n[X] University that was acquired after completing 4 years of study. [X] \nUniversity is neither licensed nor accredited. A BS in Engineering is a \nrequirement for the Engineer V position that you were hired into at \n[company]. Because you do not meet the requirements of your positon, your \nemployment with [company] Corporation is terminated effective today, July \n27, 2011. (Ex. 9)  \nOn his October 2014 e-QIP, Applicant listed the reason for leaving as \u201ccontract \nended\u201d and did not list he had been terminated. (Ex. 2, Tr. 47) In July 2011, the contract \nhe was working on was coming to an end. He believes the reason given by the company, \ni.e. his educational degree, was simply an excuse and not the real reason for his \ntermination. While working on a government contract he told his company he did not need \nthree employees to work full time on the contract. Company management then told him \nhe was not a \u201ccompany man\u201d and it was time for him to leave the company. (Tr. 48, 68) \nHe gave up his management position with the company when his support of the \ngovernment conflicted with the company\u2019s views. (Tr. 48) The company eventually lost \nthe contract he was working on. (Tr. 68)  \nIn Applicant\u2019s June 2016 enhanced subject interview, he explained his 2011 \ntermination. He admitted he had been \u201clet go\u201d from his former employer. He told the \ninvestigator that the company terminated him because his degree was not from an \naccredited school. (Ex. 4) On his November 2017 e-QIP, he listed he had been terminated \nfrom X company. (Ex. C, Tr. 49) He indicated he had been fired in 2011 and stated the \nreason as \u201cdiscrepancy with my degree. I filled out a \u2018request for transcript\u2019 for as part of \nmy hiring packet. It wasn\u2019t until almost six years later I was notified there was a problems \nwith my degree.\u201d (Ex. C)  \nWhen Applicant was told by the company that the university he attended was not \nan accredited university, he conducted an on-line computer search of the university and \nreceived conflicting information. (Ex. 4) So he did not know what to believe. Because of \nhis confusion, he listed the university on his application for his next job. The job lasted \nuntil October 2014, at which time he began employment with his current employer. (Ex. \n2). While employed at his next job, a member of management told him his degree was \nnot considered valid; however, the employer would substituted his years of experience \nfor any educational requirement. (Ex. 4) He did not list the university on his 2014 e-QIP \nor on his 2017 e-QIP. (Ex. 2, Ex. 4, Ex. C, Tr. 49) \nFollowing Applicant\u2019s 2011 termination, he received unemployment compensation. \n(Tr. 46) He testified that he believed if the termination had been justified he would not \nhave been eligible to receive unemployment benefits. (Tr. 46) However, his former \nemployer did challenged his receiving unemployment compensation. Applicant had \nmoved to another state, and the out-of-state unemployment office sent notices of hearings \nto his previous address. (Ex. 3) He received the notices after the hearing dates had \npassed. After two or three unsuccessfully attempted to reschedule the hearings, he \nreached a repayment agreement to repay benefits received. (Ex. 3, Tr. 74)  \n\n \n5 \nIn 2014, Applicant started a master\u2019s program with [State] Institute of Technology \nand completed his first class. (Tr. 72) However he did not have time to continue the \nprogram. He believes that if there was a problem with his X University\u2019s degree it would \nhave been brought to his attention when he enrolled in the master\u2019s program, as \ncompletion of a bachelor\u2019s degree is a prerequisite to enrollment in a master\u2019s degree. \n(Tr. 72) \nIn December 2016, Applicant started a job with a different company. (Ex. A) The \ncompany stopped the process for his security clearance. He was informed the processing \n\u201cwas stopped on this case due to the fact you are not in a position that requires a security \nclearance.\u201d (Tr. 2) \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which must be considered in evaluating \nan applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), \nthe adjudication process is an examination of a sufficient period and a careful weight of a \nnumber of variables of an individual\u2019s life to make an affirmative determination that the \nindividual is an acceptable security risk. This is known as the whole-person concept.  \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record.  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \n\n \n6 \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation of potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination of the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline E: Personal Conduct \n \n \nThe concerns about personal conduct are set forth in AG \u00b6 15 of the Adjudicative \nGuidelines (AG):  \n  \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. \n \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. The following disqualifying conditions are potentially applicable:  \n \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or \nsimilar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment \nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine national security \neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities; and \n \n(b) deliberately providing false or misleading information concerning \nrelevant facts to an employer, investigator, security official, competent \nmedical authority, or other official government representative. \n \nDeliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of a material fact in any written \ndocument or oral statement to the Government, when applying for a security clearance, \nis a security concern. But every inaccurate statement is not a falsification. A falsification \nmust be deliberate and material. It is deliberate if it is done knowingly and willfully. \nApplicant denies that he intentionally lied to deceive the Government. He said he made \na mistake by going through the application faster than he should have and based on faulty \nreasoning.  \n \nA judge must consider the record evidence as a whole to determine whether there \nis direct or circumstantial evidence concerning the applicant\u2019s intent or state of mind at \nthe time the omission occurred. If determined to be a deliberate omission, concealment, \n\n \n7 \nor falsification, the burden of persuasion shifts to the applicant to present evidence to \nexplain the omission. \n \n \nApplicant failed to list his 1991 arrest on his 2003 SF 86 and failed to list his 1991 \narrest and 2011 termination when he completed his 2014 e-QIP. In 1991, he went to a \nparty and spent the night with a female Marine. The next day he was charged with rape. \nHe provided a plausible explanation to avert the reasonable inference that he falsified his \nSF 86 by not listing this arrest. He answered as he did because, first, he did not know the \ncharge was a felony and second, he assumed that other individual had made a false \nallegation. When he went to court, the charges were dropped by the accuser, and the \nstate attorney said there was no evidence to file charges or continue the case. He \nassumed the matter was finished. He now understands that similar questions on security \nforms requires an affirmative answer, and he has answered affirmatively on a subsequent \ne-QIP.  \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 16(a) is not established when omissions are due to misunderstanding, \ninadvertent mistake, or other cause that could negate the willful intent. Applicant did not \nlist his 2011 termination, because he believes the company was using his lack of \neducation as an excuse to fire someone who was not a \u201ccompany man\u201d when he refused \nto add unnecessary personnel to a government contract. He was with the company \nalmost six years before the educational problem arose. On his employment application \nhe listed the university he attended. He had a duty to list his education on the application. \nHe was not required to vouch for the accreditation of the university. \n \n \n AG \u00b6 17. Conditions that could mitigate security concerns include: \n \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; \n \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; and \n \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, \nunreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely \nto recur. \n \n \n During his 2014 interview, Applicant volunteered details of his 1991 arrest and \ncorrected his previous mistake by listing it when he completed his 2017 e-QIP. In his 2016 \ninterview he explained his 2011 termination. In his 2017 e-QIP and interviews, he fully \nexplained both issues. The December 2014 subject interview states he volunteered the \ninformation about his arrest. He made good-faith efforts to correct the mistakes on his \nOctober 2014 e-QIP concerning his 1991 arrest. It was during his 2016 interview, when \n\n \n8 \nhe discussed his 2011 termination. He asserts these interviews were his first opportunity \nhe had to correct the omissions on his 2003 SF 86 and 2014 e-QIP. As previously stated, \nApplicant did not list the 1991 arrest because he did not think it was a felony and because \nhe believes a false allegation had been made against him.  \n \n \nAG \u00b6 17(c) provides mitigation where \u201cthe offense is so minor, or so much time \nhas passed, or the behavior is so infrequent, or it happened under such unique \ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's \nreliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment. The conduct is infrequent and it has been \nmore than 17 years since his arrest and four years since his termination. His arrest was \nin 1991, his termination was in 2011, he executed his SF 86 in 2003, and executed the \ne-QIP in question in 2014. The conduct in limited to a single question on his 2003 SF 86 \nand two questions on the 2014 e-QIP, which makes the conduct infrequent. He has fully \ndisclosed and explained what happened regarding each incident. The mitigating \nconditions in AG \u00b6 17(c) applies.  \n \n \nAlthough Applicant has not received counseling, he has fully explained his 1991 \narrest and his 2011 termination, and has listed each on his 2017 e-QIP. Thus, his conduct \nis unlikely to recur. The mitigating conditions in AG \u00b6 17(d) applies. Having observed \nApplicant\u2019s demeanor and listened to his testimony, I find his answer on his 2003 SF 86 \nand his answers on his 2014 e-QIP were not deliberate omissions, concealments, or \nfalsifications.  \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the potentially \ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and circumstances \nsurrounding this case. My comments under Guideline E are incorporated in my whole-\nperson analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were addressed under that guideline, \nbut some warrant additional comment. \n\n \n9 \n \nApplicant is a 46-year-old senior engineer who has worked for a defense contractor \nsince November 2017. (Ex. 2) From June 1991 to June 1997, he honorably served in the \nU.S. Army. His military service merits considerable respect.  \n \nA security clearance adjudication is an evaluation of an individual\u2019s judgment, \nreliability, and trustworthiness. When Applicant completed his job application, he listed \nthe university he attended. Almost six years later, he was terminated because the \nuniversity was not accredited. He has no duty to vouch for the university\u2019s accreditation. \nHe did not list the 1991 arrest because he did not know it was a felony and believed the \nmatter dropped when the case was nolle prosequied. He assumed he was the victim of \nfalse allegations and the matter was over. He has explained each incident on his most \nrecent e-QIP and in his interviews. \n \nI have carefully applied the law, as set forth in Egan, Exec. Or. 10865, the Directive, \nDOD Manual 5200.02, and the AGs, to the facts and circumstances in the context of the \nwhole person. The issue is whether his single response on a 2003 SF 86, his 2011 \ntermination, and his two responses on a 2014 e-QIP raises concerns about his fitness to \nhold a security clearance. (See AG & 2(c)) Overall, the record evidence leaves me without \nquestions and doubts about Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. \nFor all these reasons, I conclude Applicant has mitigated the personal conduct security \nconcerns. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Personal Conduct:  \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u20131.d:  \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant Applicant a security clearance. Eligibility for \naccess to classified information is granted.  \n \n \n \n_______________________ \nCLAUDE R. HEINY II \nAdministrative Judge \n",

Corrales, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Gregory F. Greiner, Esquire\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nMETZ, John Grattan, Jr., Administrative Judge:\nBased on the record in this case,  I deny Applicant\u2019s clearance.\n1\nOn 5 December 2016, the Department of Defense (DoD) sent Applicant a\nStatement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security concerns under Guideline D, Sexual\nBehavior, Guideline J, Criminal Conduct, Guideline E, Personal Conduct, and Guideline\nF, Financial Considerations.  Applicant timely answered the SOR, requesting a hearing\n2\nbefore the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA). DOHA assigned the case\nConsisting of the transcript (Tr.), Government exhibits (GE) 1-7, and Applicant Exhibits (AE) A-K. AE K was\n1\ntimely received post hearing. AE J was admitted for the sole purpose of identifying AE A-I for the record (Tr.\n15-16).\nDoD acted under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information Within Industry (February 20,\n2\n1960), as amended; DoD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program\n(January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) effective within the DoD on\n1 September 2006. However, on 10 December 2016, the Director of National Intelligence (DNI) signed\nSecurity Executive Agent Directive 4, implementing new AG, effective with any decision issued on or after 8\nJune 2017. My decision is the same under both guidelines.\n1\n02/06/2019\n\nto me 26 September 2017, and I convened a hearing 15 December 2017. DOHA\nreceived the transcript 2 January 2018, and the record closed.\nFindings of Fact\nApplicant admitted the SOR allegations, except SOR 3.a and paragraph 4. He is\na 37-year-old enterprise director engineer employed by a U.S. defense contractor since\nAugust 2017.  He served honorably in the U.S. military from June 2000 to July 2009,\n3\nand in a reserve component from August 2009 to March 2011. He had a favorable\nbackground investigation, with clearance issued, in September 2009 (GE 2), and a\nfavorable reinvestigation in early 2011 (GE 1). This investigation appears to be due to a\nbreak in service requiring reinvestigation.\nIn July 1999, and again in November 2010, Applicant was arrested for soliciting\nprostitution in undercover operations. He was found guilty of disturbing the peace, and\ngiven minimal sentences involving fines, school attendance, and community service, all\nof which he successfully completed. His attorneys told him that the charges would\neventually be dismissed. Applicant attributed these arrests to his experiencing\nparticularly stressful times in his life. In July 1999, he was avoiding going home to an\nabusive relationship with his father (Tr. 22). In November 2010, he was going through a\ncontentious separation\u2014and ultimately divorce\u2014with his wife, as well as trying to get\nready to go to college (Tr. 23).\nApplicant did not disclose the November 2010 arrest on either his January 2011\n(GE 2) or November 2013 (GE 1) clearance applications. He also failed to disclose six\ndelinquent debts on his November 2013 clearance application. He admits the\nomissions, but denies any intent to mislead the Government. In each instance, he was\nbeing pressed by his employer to complete the applications quickly because of\noperational requirements overseas (Tr. 29).\nThe SOR also alleges, Government exhibits substantiate, but Applicant denies\nten delinquent debts totaling over $24,000. Record evidence shows that SOR 1.j is a\nduplicate of SOR 1.a,  so there are nine debts totaling nearly $21,000 at issue The\n4\ndebts comprise a delinquent utility bill (SOR 1.d), two delinquent medical bills (SOR 1.f,\n1.g), and six delinquent education loans (SOR 1.a-1.c, 1.e, and 1.h-1.I) .\nApplicant offered a number of exhibits to demonstrate that all the SOR-alleged\ndebts had been satisfied, some more efficacious than others. AE F shows that SOR\nThis is a different contractor than originally sponsored his November 2013 clearance application.\n3\nThe account number for SOR 1.j listed in GE 7 matches the account number for SOR 1.a listed in GE 6 in\n4\npertinent part, sufficient to conclude the accounts are the same.\n2\n\ndebt 1.d was paid in full in March 2017.  AE G and H show that SOR debts 1.f and 1.g,\n5\nrespectively, were canceled and returned to the creditor with zero balances in\nNovember 2017.  Although these three debts were not addressed until after Applicant\n6\nreceived the SOR, the amounts involved are minimal, and the security concerns raised\nde minimus \n \nHowever, the remaining education loans are not so easily resolved. AE\nD\u2014March 2017 correspondence from the collection agent for the SOR 4.a creditor on\nbehalf of one of the colleges Applicant attended\u2014reflects that a $4,631.22 balance was\nsettled for an unspecified amount. However, none of the account numbers or other\nidentifying numbers listed in the correspondence match the account numbers listed in\nGE 6 or 7, although the delinquent amounts in GE 6 and AE D are similar. Similarly, AE\nE reflects that two defaulted loans held by the SOR 4.b and 4.c creditor were paid in\nMarch 2017, but contains no identifying numbers (account numbers or balances paid) to\nmatch AE E to the 4.b and 4.c numbers listed in GE 6. Applicant asserts (Tr. 36) that AE\nC shows that the education loans at SOR 1.h and 1.I have also been paid as of March\n2017. But again, neither account numbers or balances appear to confirm that claim.\nFederally guaranteed student loans are difficult to track through credit reports\nbecause of the way the loans are issued, defaulted, consolidated, and rehabilitated, \nseldom with the same account numbers attached to the accounts. Education programs\nchange names, further complicating deciphering the process. Ultimately, all the loans\nare guaranteed by the U.S. Department of Education (DOE). However, there are direct\nstudent loans (made by the DOE) and indirect student loans (made by private lenders\nthrough DOE programs). A given loan may have multiple parties involved in its\nmanagement, any or all of whom may report its status to the credit bureaus. Thus, for\nexample, Applicant\u2019s January 2014 credit report contains multiple entries from the\nlender at SOR 1.e (and its education loan arm) in current status because the loans\nchronicled were in deferred status at the time and transferred to another holder. It also\nshows an account moving into late payment status, and being transferred to the DOE,\nwhere it was ultimately paid. A further example, AE C, is a compendium of documents\npurporting to show Applicant\u2019s loan settlement with DOE. Nevertheless, the connection\nis difficult to make.  The documents show, without account numbers, six loans\n7\nSOR debt 1.d\u2014a utility bill incurred when a final bill was not forwarded after Applicant moved from a\n5\nresidence and closed the account\u2014appears on Applicant\u2019s January 2014 credit report (GE 7) and was first\nreported delinquent in March 2013. The reported account numbers on GE 7 and AE F match.\nAgain, the debts originally appear in GE 7, and the account numbers in GE 7 match the account numbers\n6\nin AE G and H.\nThe first page of the exhibit is the first page of a 3 March 2017 letter from the DOE, regarding an account\n7\nnumber that appears nowhere else in the record, whereby DOE accepts a $9,250 payment as settlement in\nfull of \u201cdefaulted student loan(s) and/or grant overpayment(s).\u201d The next two pages are a 22 July 2014 letter\nfrom the then collection agent for DOE, referencing the same account number, offering to settle Applicant\u2019s\ndefaulted loans for that amount. The fourth page is a screen shot of an otherwise-unidentified \u201cFederal Student\nAid\u201d web page, which reflects six disbursed loans totaling $18,239 and six disbursed grants totaling $17,097,\nas of 19 December 2016. The next 11 pages consist of a National Student Loan Data System printout with\n3\n\nguaranteed by DOE, two direct,  four indirect. The four indirect loans were all to the\n8\neducational institution in AE A (which shows all school charges paid). All four indirect\nloans were made by the same bank alleged as one of the creditors on SOR debt 1.e,\nand guaranteed by the same \u201cGuaranty Agency\u201d as the creditor on SOR debts 1.b and\n1.c. The first two indirect loans totaled $4,168, were serviced by the other creditor on\nSOR debt 1.e, and were listed as defaulted but paid in full effective 1 March 2017.  The\n9\nlast two indirect loans totaled $5,334, but serviced by a creditor not alleged on the SOR,\nand were listed as defaulted but paid in full effective 1 and 2 May 2014 [AE C, K(1)].\nApplicant\u2019s January 2014 credit report (GE 7) shows SOR debts 4.e-4.j, as\nalleged, encompassing the education loans, with complete account numbers, at SOR\n4.e and 4.h-4,j, with 4.j being a duplicate of SOR 4.a, which appears on Applicant\u2019s\nSeptember 2016 credit report (GE 6), with account number as alleged, along with\neducation loans 4.b and 4.c (account numbers as alleged), as well as SOR debt 4.d.\nSOR debt 4.e also appears on GE 6 (with an account number matching GE 7) with the\nsame lender as alleged in the SOR, but a different servicing agent.\nApplicant attributed his education loan problems to his not understanding the\ninterplay between the school payments being made through the military tuition\nassistance program, his grants, and his education loans. He stated that he did not\nunderstand that the military tuition assistance did not cover all his education expenses\n(Tr. 31-33). However, he acknowledges getting dunning letters from the creditors at\nSOR 1.a-1.c and 1.h-1.I beginning in 2011 (Tr. 31, 36, 51-52). He thought the creditors\ndid not adequately explain where his military tuition assistance payments went. His\ncredit reports (GE 6, 7) show that he disputed these education loans with the credit\nbureaus, but no changes were made. Further, he produced little in the way of\ndocumentation showing his efforts to resolve the loans before he received the SOR.\nNevertheless, when he received the SOR, he renewed his efforts to resolve his\neducation loans (Tr. 35, 53-54).\nApplicant documented no credit or financial counseling, and did not submit a\nbudget. He stated he had $8,181 positive bi-monthly cash flow (Tr. 58). His work and\ncharacter references (GE I, Answer) consider him honest and trustworthy and\nrecommend him for his clearance. However, none of them states any knowledge of the\nSOR issues.\nthe detailed, but not necessarily decipherable, status of Applicant\u2019s loans and grants. The grants are not at\nissue in the SOR, so I have given no consideration to those entries.\nThe two direct loans total $8,737, were being serviced directly by the DOE Debt Management and Collections\n8\nSystem (not the creditor alleged at SOR 4.a), and were listed as defaulted but paid in full effective 23 July\n2014. The two direct loans were for the educational institution in AE B, which shows that all Applicant\u2019s\ncharges at the school have been paid.\nAE K(2) shows that on 15 November 2015 the loan balances totaled $5,706.14. \n9\n4\n\nPolicies\nThe adjudicative guidelines (AG) list factors for evaluating a person\u2019s suitability\nfor access to classified information. Administrative judges must assess disqualifying and\nmitigating conditions under each issue fairly raised by the facts and situation presented.\nEach decision must also reflect a fair, impartial, and commonsense consideration of the\nfactors listed in AG \u00b6 2(a). Any one disqualifying or mitigating condition is not, by itself,\nconclusive. However, specific adjudicative guidelines should be followed where a case\ncan be measured against them, as they represent policy guidance governing access to\nclassified information. Considering the SOR allegations and the evidence as a whole,\nthe relevant adjudicative guidelines are Guideline D (Sexual Behavior), Guideline J\n(Criminal Conduct), Guideline E (Personal Conduct), and Guideline F (Financial\nConsiderations).\nSecurity clearance decisions resolve whether it is clearly consistent with the\nnational interest to grant or continue an applicant\u2019s security clearance. The Government\nmust prove, by substantial evidence, controverted facts alleged in the SOR. If it does, \nthe burden shifts to applicant to refute, extenuate, or mitigate the Government\u2019s case.\nBecause no one has a right to a security clearance, the applicant bears a heavy burden\nof persuasion.\nPersons with access to classified information enter into a fiduciary relationship\nwith the Government based on trust and confidence. Therefore, the Government has a\ncompelling interest in ensuring each applicant possesses the requisite judgement,\nreliability, and trustworthiness of those who must protect national interests as their own.\nThe \u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d standard compels resolution of any\nreasonable doubt about an applicant\u2019s suitability for access in favor of the\nGovernment.10\nAnalysis\n          \nThe Government established a case for disqualification under Guidelines D and J\nby demonstrating Applicant\u2019s two arrests for soliciting prostitution.  However, Applicant\n11\nmitigated the security concerns by demonstrating that the charges had been\nsignificantly reduced, the arrests were infrequent and occurred under particularly\nstressful circumstances, and the most recent arrest had occurred over seven years\nago.12\nSee, Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518 (1988).\n10\n\u00b613(a) sexual behavior of a criminal nature, whether or not the individual has been prosecuted; \u00b631(b)\n11\nevidence . . . of criminal conduct, regardless of whether the individual was formally charged, prosecuted, or\nconvicted;\n\u00b614(b) the sexual behavior happened so long ago, so infrequently or under such unusual circumstances,\n12\nthat it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or\njudgment; \u00b632(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it happened under such\n5\n\nThe Government failed to establish a case for disqualification under Guideline E.\nCross-referencing the sexual behavior under Guideline E (SOR 3.a) adds no security\nconcerns that are not otherwise covered under the guidelines for sexual behavior and\ncriminal conduct. Moreover, I found credible Applicant\u2019s testimony that he rushed\nthrough his clearance applications, and thus lacked intent to falsify his applications or\nmislead the Government.\nHowever, the Government established a case for disqualification under Guideline\nF, and Applicant failed to fully mitigate the security concerns. Applicant accumulated\nsignificant delinquent debt, as Federally-guaranteed education loans, and largely\nignored these obligations until after he received the SOR.13\nApplicant meets none of the mitigating conditions for financial considerations.\nThe conduct was recent, frequent, and the circumstances were not unusual.  Beginning\n14\nin 2011, Applicant was aware that his understanding of what his military tuition\nassistance covered was incorrect. After this point, the circumstances of his financial\nproblems were certainly within his control, and he was irresponsible in addressing his\ndebts until after he received the SOR.  He did not document his claimed efforts to deal\n15\nwith his lenders after becoming aware of his defaulted education loans\n \nApplicant has neither claimed nor documented any credit or financial counseling.\nAssuming the best-case scenario, Applicant has apparently made a number of\npayments to resolve education loans that may or may not correspond to the education\nloans alleged in the SOR.  However, even if I concluded that the payments received\n16\ncover the accounts alleged, the fact remains that these were not undertaken until after\nhe received the SOR. This precludes a conclusion that Applicant has made a good-faith\neffort to address his debts.  The Government is not the collection agent of last resort.\n17\nApplicants are expected to meet their financial obligations for moral reasons and legal\nrequirements. Applicant\u2019s belated efforts to address his education loans may have\nreached the point where he may be considered to have resolved them, he cannot\nunusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s relliability,\ntrustworthiness or good judgment;\n\u00b619(a) inability to satisfy debts; (b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so; (c) a\n13\nhistory of not meeting financial obligations;\n\u00b620(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such circumstances that\n14\nit is unlikely to recur . . . \n\u00b620(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s control . . . and\n15\nthe individual acted responsibly under the circumstances;\n\u00b620(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem . . .  and there are clear indications\n16\nthat the problem is being resolved or is under control;\n\u00b620(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise\n17\nresolve debts.\n6\n\nescape the security concerns raised by the fact that he did not resolve them until after\nhe received the SOR. Moreover, his work and character references were unaware of his\nfinancial problems, undercutting their ability to support a whole-person assessment to\novercome the security concerns raised by his conduct.

At one time, after being \nunemployed for six months, he was past due on four student loans, past due on a home \nequity line of credit, and owed approximately $15,500 for two medical debts. The line of \ncredit against his home equity was paid when his house sold. He is current on the \nconsolidation of his student loans. He has made sufficient progress toward resolving his \npast-due debts and delinquent obligations to continue his security clearance eligibility. \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information is granted.  \nStatement of the Case \nOn December 4, 2016, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications \nFacility (DoD CAF) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant, detailing the \nsecurity concerns under Guideline F, financial considerations, and explaining why it was \n02/13/2019\n\n \n2 \nunable to find it clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue security \nclearance eligibility for him.1  \n \nOn January 9, 2017, Applicant answered the SOR allegations and requested a \nhearing before an administrative judge from the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals \n(DOHA). On February 7, 2018, DOHA issued a Notice of Hearing scheduling a hearing \nthat was conducted on February 26, 2018.  \n \nFive Government exhibits (Ex. 1-5) and two Applicant\u2019s exhibits (Ex. A and B) were \nadmitted into evidence without objection. Records submitted by Applicant as attachments \nto his answer were considered. Applicant testified, as reflected in a transcript (Tr.) \nreceived on March 6, 2018. I held the record open after the hearing for Applicant to submit \nadditional documents, which were received and admitted into the record as Ex. C \u2013 C-3. \n \nWhile this case was pending a decision, the Director of National Intelligence issued \nSecurity Executive Agent Directive 4, establishing the National Security Adjudicative \nGuidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information or Eligibility to \nHold a Sensitive Position (AGs), which he made applicable to all covered individuals who \nrequire initial or continued eligibility for access to classified information or eligibility to hold \na sensitive position. The new AGs supersede the Sept. 1, 2006 AGs and are effective \u201cfor \nall covered individuals\u201d on or after June 8, 2017. Accordingly, I have evaluated Applicant\u2019s \nsecurity clearance eligibility under the new AGs.2 \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nIn Applicant\u2019s answer to the SOR, he admitted the delinquent obligations (SOR 1.a \n-1.f), specifically admitting a $15,149 (SOR 1.a) medical debt, which he had been told \nwas covered by his health insurance, but later he learned the majority of the cost was not \ncovered by his insurance. (Tr. 21) He admitted he owed four student loans (SOR 1.c -1.f) \nthat were for his daughter\u2019s college education. The loans totaling approximately $35,500 \nwere $2,572 past due. He denied being more than 120 days delinquent on a $32,478 \n(SOR 1.g) home equity loan, which he asserted had been paid when he sold his home in \nJune 2016. After a thorough review of the pleadings and exhibits, I make the following \nfindings of fact. \n \n \n \n \n                                                          \n1 The DoD CAF took the action under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \nIndustry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DoD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security \nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the Adjudicative Guidelines for \nDetermining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information (AG) effective within the DoD on September 1, \n2006. \n \n2 Application of the AGs that were in effect as of the issuance of the SOR would not change my decision in \nthis case. The new AGs are available at http://ogc.osd.mil/doha/5220-6 R20170608.pdf. \n  \n\n \n3 \nApplicant is a 64-year-old aircraft technical design engineer who has worked for a \ndefense contractor since July 2015. (Ex. 2) He seeks a favorable security clearance \ndetermination. (Ex 2) He is married and has a 31-year-old son, a 32-year-old daughter3, \nand a 36-year-old stepdaughter. (Ex. 2) His annual income, with overtime, is \napproximately $110,000. (Tr. 44) His wife is not employed.  \n \nFrom November 2004 until January 2015, Applicant had worked as a contractor \nfor an aircraft manufacturing company. From January 2015 through July 2015, he was \nunemployed due to company downsizing. (Tr. 43) In July 2015, he obtained a contractor\u2019s \nposition with the same aircraft manufacturing company, but the position required him to \nmove to a new state. (Ex. 2) As a result of the move, he sold his house and had to pay \nthe cost of the 2,000 mile move. (SOR Response, Tr. 12).  \n \nIn 2015, Applicant missed two or three mortgage payments on his loan for his \nprevious residence and worked with the Making Home Affordable Program. (Ex. 3) For \napproximately a year, from July 2015 through June 2016, he was paying his $800 \nmortgage at his old location and paying for a hotel at his new location, which left no extra \nmoney. (Ex. 3, Tr. 35) The SOR lists $1,869 as being 120 days past due on a $32,478 \nhome equity line of credit. (SOR 1.g) In June 2016, he sold his home. (Ex. 3) All \noutstanding debts were paid at the time of sale, including the mortgage and equity line of \ncredit. (Tr. 28, SOR Response) He received $87,858 at the time of sale representing his \nequity in the home. (SOR Response)  \n \nThree months after he sold his previous home, Applicant purchased a new home \nat his new location. (Tr. 30) The home he purchased has been paid for in full. (Tr. 39) He \nasserted he has $25,000 in savings and $5,000 in his checking account. (Tr. 40) His \nvehicles are paid for and he has no loan payments apart from his payment on his \nconsolidated student loan. (Tr. 40) His only large monthly expenditure is $1,600 for health \ninsurance. (Tr. 48)  \n \nIn 2015, when Applicant was unemployed, he was unable to make student loan \npayments. The student loans were for his daughter\u2019s college education and had been \nobtained between November 2005 and October 2008. (Ex. 4) The loans totaling \napproximately $35,500 were $2,572 past due. In June 2017, he contacted the federal \nloan servicing company which serviced the student loans in order to consolidate the four \nloans. (Ex. C-3) The servicing company\u2019s February 2018 letter indicates he owed $39,203 \non the student loans with monthly payments of $270. (Ex. C-1) At that time, he was zero \ndays delinquent on the loan and had unpaid interest of $57. (Ex. B) The student loan \npayment is automatically debited from his bank account. (Tr. 47) He asserts he has made \nhis monthly payments in a timely manner since March 2017. (Tr. 37)  \n \nDuring his June 2016 enhanced subject interview, he stated his intention was to \nfirst buy a house and then establish a payment plan to resolve the student loan obligation. \n(Ex. 3) At that time, he believed he could pay off all of the student loans in three to five \nyears. (Ex. 3)  \n                                                          \n3 At the hearing, Applicant stated his daughter was 24 year old and was living with him. (Tr. 23)  \n\n \n4 \n \nIn March 2017, Applicant agreed to pay a financial repair company approximately \n$600 over six months to assist him in restoring his credit profile and maximizing his credit \nscore. (Ex. C-2, Tr. 46) He had one financial counseling session with the company. (Tr. \n38) He had incurred a $15,489 medical collection debt (SOR 1.a) when he had a stent \ninserted in the blood vessel going to his liver. (Tr. 44) He had medical insurance, and \nprior to the procedure had been told the medical procedure would be covered by his \ninsurance. (Tr. 24) After the procedure, he learned most of the cost was not covered by \nhis insurance. The medical debt no longer appears on his credit report. (Tr. 24, Ex. 6)  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s November 2015 credit report lists the four past-due student loans, a \npast-due home equity line of credit, a past-due mortgage, and the medical collection debt \n(SOR 1.a $15,489). (Ex. 4) It also list 18 accounts as being \u201cpaid as agreed.\u201d His August \n2016 credit report lists a zero balance on his home equity line of credit and mortgage \nloan. (Ex. 4) The credit report lists the medical collection account, but does not list any \namount as past due on the debt. (Ex. 5) His February 2018 credit report lists no collection \naccounts or any past-due amounts. (Ex. 6) The medical debt no longer appears as a debt \non his February 2018 credit report. (Ex. 6) He asserted he paid the $115 medical debt \n(SOR 1.b). (Tr. 27) The debt does not appear on either of his most recent credit reports. \n(Ex. 5, Ex. 6) \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which must be considered in evaluating \nan applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), \nthe adjudication process is an examination of a sufficient period and a careful weight of a \nnumber of variables of an individual\u2019s life to make an affirmative determination that the \nindividual is an acceptable security risk. This is known as the whole-person concept.  \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record.  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \n\n \n5 \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation of potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination of the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \n \nAdjudicative Guideline (AG) \u00b6 18 articulates the security concerns relating to \nfinancial problems: \n \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information . . . An individual who is financially \noverextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or otherwise \nquestionable acts to generate funds. \n \nAdditionally, an individual who is financially irresponsible may also be \nirresponsible, unconcerned, negligent, or careless in properly handling and safeguarding \nclassified information. Behaving responsibly or irresponsibly in one aspect of life provides \nan indication of how a person may behave in other aspects of life. \n \nA person\u2019s relationship with his creditors is a private matter until evidence is \nuncovered demonstrating an inability or unwillingness to repay debts under agreed-upon \nterms. Absent evidence of strong extenuating or mitigating circumstances, an applicant \nwith a history of serious or recurring financial difficulties is in a position of risk that is \ninconsistent with holding a security clearance. An applicant is not required to be debt free, \nbut is required to manage his finances to meet his financial obligations. \n \nThe SOR lists two medical collection accounts, $2,572 as past due on four student \nloans, and $1,869 past due on a home equity line of credit. AG \u00b6 19 includes two qualifying \n\n \n6 \nconditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying in this case: \u201c(a) \ninability to satisfy debts,\u201d and \u201c(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations.\u201d The \nGovernment\u2019s evidence and Applicant\u2019s own admissions raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and 19(c). The burden shifted to Applicant to produce evidence to rebut, \nexplain, extenuate, or mitigate the security concerns. (Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15) An applicant \nhas the burden of proving a mitigating condition, and the burden of disproving it never \nshifts to the Government. (See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sept. 22, 2005)). \n \n \nFour of the seven Financial Considerations mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6\u00b6 20 \nare potentially applicable: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving counseling for the problem \nfrom a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit counseling \nservice, and there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved \nor is under control; and \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \n \nApplicant was $1,869 past due on a $32,478 home equity line of credit. In June \n2016, the debt was paid when his house sold. At that time, he received almost $88,000 \nin equity from the home sale. He purchased a new house that is paid in full as are his \nvehicles.  \n \nIn 2015, Applicant was out of work for six months when his company downsized. \nHe incurred moving expenses when he obtained a new job 2,000 miles away. For a year, \nuntil his house sold, he had to make his mortgage payments as well as paying for a motel \nstay. When he was unemployed, four student loans went past due. In May 2017, he \nconsolidated the four loans and entered into an agreement whereby the monthly loan \npayment on the consolidated loans would be automatically deducted from his account. \nAs of February 2018, there was no delinquency on the student loan debt. He asserts he \npaid the $115 medical debt. Neither that medical debt, nor the larger medical debt appear \non his most current credit report. His annual salary is $110,000, and he has $30,000 in \nhis saving and checking accounts.  \n \n\n \n7 \nApplicant\u2019s November 2015 credit reports, listed the past due accounts and the \ntwo medical collection accounts, but also listed 18 accounts as being paid as agreed. \nThat November 2015 credit report followed his six months of unemployment from January \nthrough July 2015.  \n \nAG \u00b6 20(b) applies. Applicant\u2019s financial situation was compromised by his six \nmonths of unemployment and having to make his mortgage payments at his previous \nlocation while also paying for a motel stay at his new location. Loss of employment is a \nfactor beyond his control as is having to relocate 2,000 miles for a new job. Additionally, \nhe had a medical procedure to have a stent inserted into a blood vessel. Prior to the \nprocedure, he was told the cost would be covered by insurance. After the procedure, he \nlearned the majority of the cost was not covered by his insurance. Such a procedure is \nnot elective surgery. It may not have been a medical emergency, but it did result in a debt \nthat was largely beyond his control.  \n \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 20(c) and 20(d) apply. He received financial counseling, his home equity \nline of credit debt was paid, and he is current on the student loan payments. He initiated, \nand is adhering to, a good-faith effort to repay his past-due student loans. His income and \namounts on deposit in his checking and saving accounts, indicate he has sufficient \nincome and funds to resolve his debts, especially when he has no house or vehicle \npayments.  \n \n \nThe medical debts do not appear on Applicant\u2019s current credit report. He has \nsufficient income and savings to address the medical debt should that debt be pursued \nby the creditor. There is no indication the creditor is pursuing the debt.  \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the potentially \ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and circumstances \n\n \n8 \nsurrounding this case. My comments under Guideline F are incorporated in my whole-\nperson analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were addressed under that guideline \nbut some warrant additional comment. \n \nApplicant is 64 years old, and he has been employed by a DoD contractor as an \naircraft engineer since July 2015. A security clearance adjudication is an evaluation of an \nindividual\u2019s judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. It is not a debt-collection procedure. \nThe largest of his obligations are the student loans. At one time the loans were past due, \nbut have now been consolidated and he is current on his payment on the debt. Incurring \nstudent loans is seen as an obligation incurred to improve his daughter\u2019s life, with respect \nto future employment and career prospects, and, as such, are viewed differently than a \ndebt obligation for a new car or credit card debt.  \n \nThere is no indication in the record as to the status of the larger of the two medical \ndebts. It is clear that the debt no longer appears on Applicant\u2019s credit report. There are \nnumerous reasons why a debt may no longer appear on a credit report. However, there \nis no indication the creditor is pursuing collection of the medical debt. Should the creditor \npursue collection, Applicant has sufficient income and savings to address the debt.  \n \nI have carefully applied the law, as set forth in Egan, Exec. Or. 10865, the Directive, \nDOD Manual 5200.02, and the AGs, to the facts and circumstances in the context of the \nwhole person. The issue is not simply whether all the delinquent obligations have been \npaid\u2014it is whether his financial circumstances raise concerns about his fitness to hold a \nsecurity clearance. (See AG & 2(c)) Overall, the record evidence leaves me without \nquestions and doubts about Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. \nFor all these reasons, I conclude Applicant has mitigated the financial considerations \nsecurity concerns. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Financial Considerations: FOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.g:  \nFor Applicant \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant Applicant a security clearance. Eligibility for \naccess to classified information is granted.  \n \n_______________________ \nCLAUDE R. HEINY II \nAdministrative Judge \n",

Under Guideline A, the Government alleges that until at least January 2015, Applicant was a member and high-ranking officer of an organization that advocates sedition against the U.S. government, advocates the use of force and violence to overthrow and influence the U.S. government, and to prevent others from exercising their lawful, constitutional rights. (SOR \u00b6 1.a) This is also cross-alleged under Guideline E as a personal conduct concern. (SOR \u00b6 2.a) In his answer to the SOR, Applicant acknowledged that he had been a member of the organization, but denied the characterizations and aims of the group as alleged. He did not address whether he had been a \u201chigh-ranking officer\u201d of Group X. (Answer) The other Guideline E allegations concern Applicant\u2019s prior marijuana use and criminal offenses. (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.b \u2013 2.g) I will refer to the organization at issue as \u201cGroup X,\u201d and have chosen not to identify the group by name, due to Privacy Act implications.

Or.) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February \n20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security \n\n \n2 \n \n \nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the \nNational Security Adjudicative Guidelines (AG), which became effective on June 8, \n2017. Applicant answered the SOR on October 19, 2018, and requested a hearing \nbefore an administrative judge of the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA).  \n \nThis case was assigned to me on January 9, 2019. On February 1, 2019, DOHA \nissued a notice scheduling the hearing for February 20, 2019. The hearing took place as \nscheduled. Department Counsel submitted Government\u2019s Exhibits (GE) 1 through 11, \nall of which were admitted but for GE 2, the unauthenticated summary of Applicant\u2019s \nbackground interview. (Tr. 18-19) GE 3 through GE 11 were admitted over Applicant\u2019s \nobjections. (Tr. 22-44) Applicant testified. He did not submit any proposed exhibits. The \nhearing transcript (Tr.) was received on March 4, 2019.  \n \nThe SOR allegations and the Government\u2019s supporting evidence \n \nWhile I admitted all but one of the Government\u2019s proposed exhibits, upon \nreflection, some of them warrant additional analysis concerning their weight. I address \nthem here, as appropriate, before turning to the Findings of Fact.  \n \nUnder Guideline A, the Government alleges that until at least January 2015, \nApplicant was a member and high-ranking officer of an organization that advocates \nsedition against the U.S. government, advocates the use of force and violence to \noverthrow and influence the U.S. government, and to prevent others from exercising \ntheir lawful, constitutional rights. (SOR \u00b6 1.a) This is also cross-alleged under Guideline \nE as a personal conduct concern. (SOR \u00b6 2.a) In his answer to the SOR, Applicant \nacknowledged that he had been a member of the organization, but denied the \ncharacterizations and aims of the group as alleged. He did not address whether he had \nbeen a \u201chigh-ranking officer\u201d of Group X. (Answer) The other Guideline E allegations \nconcern Applicant\u2019s prior marijuana use and criminal offenses. (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.b \u2013 2.g) \n \n \nI will refer to the organization at issue as \u201cGroup X,\u201d and have chosen not to \nidentify the group by name, due to Privacy Act implications. In its case in chief, the \nGovernment submitted several documents either from Group X or about its beliefs, all \ndated between 1983 and 2018. (GE 7-11) (The record copies of these documents \nsubmitted at hearing are highlighted. Applicant\u2019s counsel had the opportunity to review \nthose highlights during the hearing. (Tr. 45-46))  \n \n \nGovernment Exhibit 10 is a reported federal appellate case, published in 1983. \nThe case holds that Group X was not entitled to federal tax-exempt status because: a) \ntheir materials did not fit a reasonable interpretation of the statutory term \u201ceducational;\u201d \nb) Group X \u201cfailed to present any reasoned development of its conclusions\u201d in its \npublications; and c) Group X \u201cwas not \u2018educational\u2019 because its principal function was \nthe mere presentation of unsupported opinion.\u201d (GE 10 at 1)  \n \nIn considering GE 10, I have taken notice of the court\u2019s central holding, about \nGroup X\u2019s tax status, but cannot consider any of the evidence that court had before it, \n\n \n3 \n \n \nsince it is not in the record here. I also give GE 10 very little weight, given its age, and \nlack of specific connection to Applicant.  \n \nGovernment\u2019s Exhibit 11 is a 2014 probate case, in which a Canadian court \ninvalidated the testator\u2019s bequest of his estate to Group X on the grounds that the \nwritings and other communications of Group X are illegal under Canadian law and \ncontrary to Canadian public policy. (GE 11) As with GE 10, the evidence that was \nbefore the Canadian court is not in the record here (with limited exception noted below). \nAdditionally, Canadian case law has no precedential value, either in American \nadministrative law in general, or in DOHA jurisprudence in particular, and it would be \nerror to follow it here. Thus, the conclusions of the Canadian court in that case are \nirrelevant.  \n \nNevertheless, review of GE 11 reveals that certain paragraphs in the Canadian \ncourt opinion include block quotes from published materials from Group X that are in the \nrecord in this case. Specifically, paragraphs 15-18 and 20-23 of GE 11 are excerpted \nfrom a document entitled \u201cWhat is [Group X].\u201d That document is not in evidence here. \nHowever, the excerpts in those paragraphs in GE 11 appear identical to similar excerpts \nfrom Group X\u2019s website, printed in May 2018, which is in evidence here, as GE 9. \nSimilarly, paragraph 23 of GE 11 is excerpted from Group X\u2019s Bulletin of April/May \n1990, admitted in this case as GE 7; and paragraph 24 of GE 11 is excerpted from \nGroup X\u2019s Bulletin of January 1994, admitted here as GE 8. Thus, though I may \nconsider those excerpts, their reference in GE 11 is duplicative. GE 11, and its \nconclusions, are otherwise irrelevant.  \n \nGovernment\u2019s Exhibits 7 and 8 are newsletters published by Group X in 1990 \nand 1994, respectively. Government Exhibit 9 is printout from Group X\u2019s website, \naccessed in May 2018. These exhibits are discussed below in the Findings of Fact.  \n \nFindings of Fact  \n \n \nIn his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted the sole allegation under Guideline \nA (SOR \u00b6 1.a) with an explanation, and, by reference, the cross-allegation under \nGuideline E (SOR \u00b6 2.a). He admitted SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.b \u2013 2.g, also with explanations. I \nincorporate his admissions and explanations into the findings of fact. After a thorough \nand careful review of the pleadings and the record evidence submitted, I make the \nfollowing additional findings of fact. (I also incorporate my factual findings about the \nGovernment\u2019s evidence, discussed above.) \n \n \nApplicant is 43 years old. He graduated from high school in 1994. (Tr. 147; GE 1) \nHe has never married but has a longtime cohabitant. They have three children, ages 17, \n15, and 13. (Tr. 126-127) He previously worked for a government contractor for several \nyears, until 2001, when he was injured on the job. He received workmen\u2019s \ncompensation, and he was unemployed from September 2001 to October 2013. During \nthat time he was a \u201cstay-at-home dad\u201d raising his children. (GE 1 at 13; Tr. 129-131, \n141) Applicant returned to the workforce in October 2013, and has worked for his \n\n \n4 \n \n \ncurrent employer, a defense contractor, since October 2014. He has not held a security \nclearance before. (Tr. 9-10, 48, 131-133, GE 1)   \n \nGuideline E  \n \nIn March 1991, Applicant was arrested and charged with breaking and entering \nafter he and some high school friends broke into an office at a mall. (SOR \u00b6 2.c). They \ninitially left the scene, but were arrested when they returned a short time later. He was \nfound guilty in juvenile court, placed on probation, and fined. He attended several weeks \nof counseling and a youth offender program. (GE 3 at 2; GE 5 at \u201cp. 60\u201d; Tr. 66-67) \n \nIn June 1993, Applicant was arrested and charged with carrying a concealed \nweapon after he was found in possession of a knife while at a mall with friends. (SOR \u00b6 \n2.d) He was found guilty in juvenile court and ordered to perform community service. \n(GE 3 at 2; GE 5 at \u201cp. 60\u201d; Tr. 68-70) \n \nIn November 1993, Applicant was involved in an altercation with numerous other \nstudents at his high school. The altercation was racially motivated. Though Applicant \nclaimed self-defense, others accused him of having a weapon and pressed charges. \n(GE 3 at 2-3) Applicant was arrested and charged with assault and battery and \nbrandishing a firearm. (SOR \u00b6 2.e) In juvenile court, he pleaded not guilty, but court \nrecords state that evidence was sufficient to convict. There is no indication that a \nconviction was entered, and in December 1994, the charges were dismissed. (GE 5 at \n\u201cp. 60\u201d; Tr. 70-71) \n \nIn March 1994, Applicant was at a party with friends when he had an altercation \nwith an interracial couple. The police were called and Applicant was questioned and \nreleased. The couple then pressed charges. When the police came to Applicant\u2019s home, \nthey searched it and found a sawed-off shotgun. He was arrested and charged with \nassault and battery, and felony possession of a sawed-off shotgun. (SOR \u00b6 2.f) He \ntestified that the weapon was his father\u2019s but that he had altered it. In December 1994, \nhe was convicted on the felony weapon charge and was later sentenced to six years in \njail, all suspended, and six years of probation. He was released from probation in 1999. \n(GE 1; GE 3 at 3; GE 4; Tr. 71-75, 148-149) \n \nIn August 1994, Applicant and several friends vandalized a local black church, \nwhich the record indicates was located in a white neighborhood. He spray-painted racial \nand religious slurs on the church, such as \u201cwhite power,\u201d the phrase \u201cn - - - - - s out,\u201d \n(the phrase includes the racial epithet commonly known as \u201cthe N word\u201d), a \u201cburning \ncross,\u201d and a reference to Adolph Hitler and the \u201cSS\u201d (GE 2 at 4; GE 5 at \u201cp. 45\u201d; Tr. 71-\n76) Applicant was arrested and charged with felony willful and malicious defacement of \nchurch property. In January 1995, he was convicted and sentenced to five years in jail, \nthree years suspended, and ten years of probation. (SOR \u00b6 2.g). (GE 1, GE 4, GE 5) He \nserved ten months in jail and paid a $2,000 fine. He was released from probation early, \nin October 1999. (GE 5 at \u201cp. 38\u201d; Tr. 150). At hearing, though he accepted \nresponsibility for what he did, Applicant denied knowing at the time that it was a black \n\n \n5 \n \n \nchurch. He acknowledged \u201cpainting some pretty offensive stuff on it\u201d and that \u201cit wasn\u2019t \nthat funny.\u201d (Tr. 76)  \n \nApplicant allegedly used marijuana, with varying frequency, from 1986 until 2013. \n(SOR \u00b6 1.a) More specifically, he tried marijuana once in 1986, when he was 10, \nsmoked it daily from about 1990 to 1995, and again \u201con and off\u201d between November \n2005 and August 2013. (GE 1 at 25; GE 3 at 4; Tr. 134, 138-140) He also \nacknowledged that he procured the marijuana by purchasing it. He resumed using \nmarijuana in 2005 when he joined a band. (Tr. 136-140) \n \nNeither Applicant nor his cohabitant use marijuana. However, he acknowledged \nthat he is around marijuana on a weekly basis, when he is with other band members \nwho use it. He said his friends know better than to offer it to him. He denied any other \nillegal drug use since 2013. He said he does not intend to use marijuana until it is \nlegalized. (Tr. 134-138) He acknowledged that marijuana is illegal under Federal law \nand under the law of his home state. He is subject to drug testing at work. (Tr. 142-143) \n \nGuideline A \n \nAccording to the Government\u2019s evidence, Group X was founded in the early \n1970s. Among its founders was Dr. P. (GE 9 at 16, 18; Tr. 82, 124) Both GE 7 and GE \n8, newsletters published by Group X in 1990 and 1994, contain \u201cCommentary\u201d from Dr. \nP that can generally be described as racist, anti-Semitic, and homophobic. The \ncommentary also advocates racial and religious genocide. (GE 8 at 5) Applicant was not \na member of Group X when those newsletters were published. He denied that Group \nX\u2019s views, as expressed in GE 7 and GE 8 were the views of Group X when he was a \nmember years later. (Tr. 112)  \n \n \nIn March 2000, Applicant was interviewed by an agent of the Defense Security \nService as part of what was probably a security clearance investigation. (GE 3; Tr. 59-\n60, 86) In a portion of his sworn statement, Applicant said he had been a self-described \n\u201cskinhead\u201d since 1991. As such, he described his views concerning white supremacy \nand white separatism as follows:  \n \nI believe that the white race is the most evolved race and should be \npreserved. Any further evolution of the white race should occur within the \nwhite gene pool only. I believe that white people should not socialize or \nbreed with other races. I believe that other races and Jewish people \nshould exist, but within their own specified territory. I don\u2019t like people of \nother races being in a position of authority to me. I don\u2019t think they should \nbe in any positions of power or authority. (GE 3 at 5; Tr. 169-70) \n \nApplicant said in the statement that he regularly used the internet to read and \nlearn about \u201cnational socialist views.\u201d He printed national socialist literature and \ndistributed it. He acknowledged wearing clothes and having tattoos that symbolized his \nbeliefs, including \u201cthe German Cross, the Swastika, the Triskellon (symbol of the South \n\n \n6 \n \n \nAfrican resistance), 88 (symbol of skinhead culture), and the confederate flag.\u201d (GE 3 at \n6)  \n \nApplicant acknowledged at hearing that he had most of those tattoos at the time, \nbut he has since had all but one of them covered up with other tattoos. He still has a \ntattoo of the number \u201c88\u201d on the back of his neck, under his ponytail. He said it \nsymbolized \u201cskinhead culture. He said he has not decided how to cover up that tattoo \n(with another one). (Tr. 62-65, 162-163) \n \nIn the March 2000 statement, Applicant disavowed the use of violence to \n\u201cenforce my beliefs,\u201d or to change the fact that \u201cother races\u201d were \u201cin positions of \npower.\u201d He said, \u201cI plan to use education as opposed to violence to spread my message \nto others.\u201d (GE 3 at 6) He referenced his prior criminal conduct (\u201cvandalism and \nfighting\u201d) and noted that he engaged in those activities when he was \u201cyounger and \nimmature.\u201d He said, \u201cI am not a violent person and do not want to use violence as a \nmeans to accomplish any of my goals.\u201d (GE 3 at 6)  \n \nIn the sworn statement, Applicant also stated that \u201cI am not in any formal group \nor organization of skin heads. I practice this belief system with my girlfriend and my \nfriends.\u201d (GE 3 at 6; Tr. 65) At his hearing, Applicant confirmed that he was not a \nmember of Group X when he made his sworn statement to the DSS Agent. (GE 2). \nHowever, he also acknowledged that he had been contemplating joining the group at \nthe time, and testified that he deliberately waited to join Group X until after he made the \nstatement to the DSS agent so he would not have to declare his membership in the \ngroup during his background interview. (Tr. 83, 86-87, 145-146) \n \nSo I waited a couple of weeks after the -- until after the interview before I \nsent in my application for membership. And I did that intentionally so that \nwhen I did the interview, I wouldn\u2019t have to say I was a member of \nanything, and I wouldn\u2019t be lying. (Tr. 83) \n \nDr. P died in 2002. According to Group X\u2019s website, this led eventually to a \n\u201cleadership vacuum\u201d and some tension about the organization\u2019s future direction. (GE 9 \nat 18-19) Applicant is not named in GE 9, but he confirmed the group\u2019s leadership void \nand resulting \u201cchaos\u201d after Dr. P\u2019s death. (Tr. 88) \n \nApplicant said between 2000 and 2009, he went to group meetings about once or \ntwice a year, at Group X\u2019s meeting hall, in a neighboring state. He acknowledged \nengaging in recruiting efforts, but stopped doing so in about 2007 or 2008. (Tr. 90) He \ndenied attempting to recruit people at work. (Tr. 91)  \n \nApplicant testified that as of about 2004, he no longer considered himself a \n\u201cskinhead.\u201d He considered those individuals \u201cpretty much just a bunch of drunken thugs\u201d \nwho did not have a \u201cprofessional attitude\u201d about anything. He decided to grow his hair \nout and to be more professional. (Tr. 60-61, 159-161) \n \n\n \n7 \n \n \nApplicant also testified \u201cphilosophically I was \u2013 I left it [Group X] in 2009.\u201d (Tr. 54, \n87, 151) However, \u201cI still found some validity in some of their philosophical beliefs.\u201d (Tr. \n88) For a period of time, he and his cohabitant (whom he had recruited into the group) \nhad little to no involvement with the organization. (\u201cWhen I left it, I left it, we left it,\u201d he \nsaid.)(Tr. 129)  \n \nIn 2012, Applicant was asked by other Group X leaders, whom he knew, to be a \nmember of the board. This led him to change his mind, and he re-engaged. (Tr. 129) \nGroup X was also a corporation chartered in State 1, where Applicant lives. (Tr. 87-89, \n151-152) In February 2012, Applicant filed an annual report with State 1\u2019s regulatory \nauthorities on behalf of Group X, in his capacity as a director and officer. His title is \nlisted as Vice-President and Treasurer. Applicant is listed on the filing documents as the \nState 1 Registered Agent, and his home address is listed as the office address for \nGroup X. His name is typed into the signature block on the 2012 Annual Report. (GE 6 \nat 3) Group X\u2019s registered address is also the home address Applicant gave on his \nSCA, GE 1. \n \nApplicant testified that, as an officer and director of Group X, he attended Group \nX board meetings three or four times a year. He testified that, despite being listed on \nGE 6 as the treasurer for several years, he had no knowledge of Group X\u2019s financial \ninformation. (Tr. 94)  \n \nIn his December 2014 SCA (GE 1) Applicant disclosed that in about April 2014, \nhe and two other board members of what he called \u201ca not for profit corporation\u201d were \nsued in State 1 court. Among the people Applicant names in GE 1 are the treasurer \n(Ms. C) and the president of Group X (Mr. G), as identified in the corporate filing with \nState 1. (GE 6 at 3; Tr. 118-119)  \n \nMr. G is identified on Group X\u2019s website as its chairman at the time. (GE 9 at 19) \nIn late 2014, Mr. G resigned as chairman, and was replaced by Mr. W, the same \nindividual who filed the change of address and change of registered agent form with the \nState 1 agency in January 2015. (GE 6; GE 9 at 19) \n \n \nApplicant did not identify Group X on his December 2014 SCA when he \ndisclosed the lawsuit, though he did list several individuals who were then, or who had \npreviously been, Group X members. (GE 1 at 35; Tr. 118-119) There are no documents \nfrom that lawsuit in the record evidence in this case to definitively identify the parties \ninvolved.  \n \nApplicant acknowledged that, being an officer and director of Group X, he was a \ngroup leader, and represented the organization\u2019s beliefs. (Tr. 94) He confirmed in his \ntestimony that Group X\u2019s beliefs, as detailed in GE 9, the 2018 website excerpt, were \ntheir beliefs when Applicant was a member of the Group. (Tr. 99-100)  \n \nApplicant also stated that he knew, from his prior association with Group X, that \n\u201cillegal activity was frowned upon,\u201d and \u201cthere wasn\u2019t going to be anything in here that \n\n \n8 \n \n \nsaid \u2018go out and violate people\u2019s rights, or overthrow the government, or do this or do \nthat.\u2019 I already knew that wasn\u2019t in there, at least when I was involved.\u201d (Tr. 110) \nApplicant testified that \u201cit was a very well understood policy of [Group X] that illegal \nactivity would get you kicked out . . . and discussion of it, planning of it, talking about it, \nwas cause for immediate dismissal.\u201d (Tr. 55, 171-172; Answer) In the 1990 newsletter, \nDr. P made a similar statement: \u201cWe have always, as a matter of policy, avoided illegal \nacts or other activity which might bring us into conflict with the government\u2019s law \nenforcement apparatus. . . . in the future we may not be able to avoid such conflict. . . .\u201d \n(GE 7 at 3-4) \n \nApplicant testified that during a board meeting conducted by teleconference,  \n \n[Applicant] had been pressuring the chairman, for some years, to change \nthe direction of [the group], to stop being adversarial towards other people, \nother races. And if we really wanted to preserve our people and our \nculture, that we should really learn to work with people rather than trying to \ntake on the world, that made no sense. And it took several years of finally \ngetting them to agree. We actually changed the bylaws of [the group]. We \ntook a vote on it, by phone. And I believe as soon as the bylaws were \nchanged, that is when the lawsuit kicked off. \u201d (Tr. 121-122; see also Tr. \n124-125, 170-171) \n \nApplicant testified that he submitted a letter of resignation and resigned from \nGroup X and its board in March 2014. That letter is not in evidence. During the lawsuit, \nhe learned that he was still listed as the registered agent for Group X, and was still an \nofficer and a director. He testified that in January 2015, Applicant went on the website of \nthe State 1 regulatory authority and removed his name from Group X\u2019s registration \npapers. (Tr. 117, 152-157; GE 6) Applicant denied that the fact that he had submitted an \nSCA in December 2014 had anything to do with the timing of his actions. (Tr. 158) \nAnnual reports filed by Group X in later years (2016-2018) with State 1 do not list \nApplicant as an officer or director and do not list his home address as Group X\u2019s office \nof record in State 1. (GE 6) \n \n \nApplicant denied ever having a discussion with other Group X members about \nissues relating to sedition or overthrowing the United States Government. (Tr. 55) \nApplicant is a United States citizen. He testified that he has given no thought to \nrenouncing his U.S. citizenship for that of another country. (Tr. 58) \n \nApplicant\u2019s SCA contains several questions about his \u201cAssociation Record.\u201d (GE \n1 at Section 29) Questions asked include: a) whether Applicant had knowingly or \nintentionally ever been a member of an organization \u201cdedicated to the use of violence or \nforce to overthrow the United States Government and which engaged in activities to that \nend . . .\u201d; and b) whether he had ever been a member of an organization \u201cthat \nadvocates or practices commission of acts of violence or force to discourage others \nfrom exercising their rights under the U.S. Constitution or any state of the United States \nwith the specific intent to further such action.\u201d Applicant answered \u201cNo\u201d to both \n\n \n9 \n \n \nquestions, and to all others under Section 29. The Government did not allege in the \nSOR that these answers were deliberately false. (Tr. 186-187) \n \nGE 9, excerpted from the Group X website, details its white supremacist and \nseparatist views, under a subheading, \u201cBuilding a New White World.\u201d The group\u2019s stated \ngoals include \u201cWhite Living Space,\u201d \u201cAn Aryan Society,\u201d \u201cA Responsible Government,\u201d \n\u201cA New Educational System,\u201d and \u201cAn Economic Policy Based on Racial Principles.\u201d \n(GE 9)  \n \nUnder the \u201cResponsible Government\u201d subheading, GE 9 states that due to \u201cthe \ngrowth of mass democracy,\u201d including increased voting enfranchisement of \u201cnon-\nWhites\u201d and the \u201ccontrol over the media\u201d by Jews, \u201cthe U.S. government was gradually \ntransformed into the malignant monster it is today: the single most dangerous and \ndestructive enemy our race has ever known.\u201d (GE 9 at 7) \n \nApplicant denied that through this statement, or otherwise, Group X advocated \nsedition against the United States Government, or sought to \u201coverthrow\u201d it, by violence \nor other means. (Tr. 122-124) He testified,    \n \n[Y]ou are recognizing that apparently there are policies, and programs in \nplace that are dangerous to your people and you have to change that. It \ndoesn\u2019t say anything about violating the law or doing anything like that. . . I \nmean, the government can be considered a threat to many things, life \nliberty, pursuit of happiness, depending on, you know, how you look at it. \nSo I would say that I don\u2019t think declaring it an enemy in, like, a military \nterm. Maybe on a philosophical term. I mean, that it how it reads to me. \n(Tr. 100-101) (discussing GE 9)) \n \nApplicant acknowledged that when he joined Group X, the group believed \u201cthat \nthe government was working against the interest of white people and culture, definitely \nbelieved that, they definitely believed that . . . and so did I . . . .\u201d (Tr. 122) Applicant \ndenied that Group X advocated going out and stopping \u201cother people from doing what \nthey have a constitutional right to do.\u201d (Tr. 103) He also said, \u201cI can\u2019t speak for what it \nstands for now.\u201d (Tr. 103) \n \nApplicant testified that if he had been aware that Group X espoused a philosophy \nof violence or overthrow of the government, he would \u201cabsolutely not\u201d have joined it. (Tr. \n170) He testified that he has not been a member of Group X, and has not attended any \nmeetings for several years. (Tr. 56, 157) Applicant denied any further contact with \nanyone he knew to be a member of Group X. Occasionally, he gets phone calls from \nthe former chairman of Group X, but does not believe the individual remains a member. \n(Tr. 57, 125-126) \n \nApplicant testified that he has never had any issues with coworkers at his current \njob. His coworkers come from a variety of backgrounds, races, and creeds. (Tr. 48, 133; \nAnswer) He testified that, the day before the hearing, he told some of his coworkers, of \n\n \n10 \n \n \nother races, that \u201cI used to be a skinhead, I used to be a white supremacist.\u201d (Tr. 134) \nThis testimony is uncorroborated.  \n \nApplicant denied that he considers himself to be a \u201dskinhead\u201d anymore. (Tr. 160) \nHe also testified that he no longer considers himself to be a white supremacist; indeed, \nhe testified that he \u201ccan\u2019t be\u201d one, because he learned in about 2012 that one of his \ngrandparents, who he had never met, was a Native American. (Tr. 161-162)  \n \n \nWhen asked why his prior membership in Group X should no longer be \nconsidered a security concern, Applicant said,  \n \nWell, I\u2019m not a member. I don\u2019t believe, or ascribe to those views. . . . I \ndon\u2019t know what else to say. I don\u2019t follow any of that philosophy, or \nanything like that, any form of socialism or collectivism, or any of that. (Tr. \n168) \n \nApplicant acknowledged his prior criminal record, has accepted responsibility for \nhis actions, and said he has paid the price. He said he has matured and has not been \n\u201cin trouble\u201d for a long time. (Tr. 168; SOR Answer) To show that he is considered \nrehabilitated by authorities, he testified that he has a concealed handgun permit in his \nhome state. He testified that he successfully applied with the federal Bureau of Alcohol, \nTobacco, and Firearms (ATF) for a permit to build a suppressor for his handgun. He \ntestified that he has been a licensed armed security officer in his home state since \n2009. These assertions are undocumented. He has not committed any other crimes \nbeyond those alleged. He has had his voting rights restored. (Tr. 49-51, 144-145) \nApplicant attested to his patriotism and to the valuable service he provides to the \ncountry and to the U.S. military at work. (Tr. 166) \n \nApplicant provided no documents in support of his case, and he offered no \ncharacter testimony, documented or otherwise. Thus, his own testimony is in all \nrespects uncorroborated by other sources. \n  \nPolicies \n \n \nIt is well established that no one has a right to a security clearance. As the \nSupreme Court held, \u201cthe clearly consistent standard indicates that security \ndeterminations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Department of the Navy \nv. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988). \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \n\n \n11 \n \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(a), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have not drawn inferences grounded on \nmere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.\u201d \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline A, Allegiance to the United States   \n \n \nAG \u00b6 3 sets forth the security concern over an applicant\u2019s allegiance:   \n \nThe willingness to safeguard classified or sensitive information is in doubt \nif there is any reason to suspect an individual's allegiance to the United \nStates. There is no positive test for allegiance, but there are negative \nindicators. These include participation in or support for acts against the \nUnited States or placing the welfare or interests of another country above \nthose of the United States. Finally, the failure to adhere to the laws of the \nUnited States may be relevant if the violation of law is harmful to stated \nU.S. interests. An individual who engages in acts against the United \n\n \n12 \n \n \nStates or provides support or encouragement to those who do has already \ndemonstrated willingness to compromise national security. \n \n  \nAG \u00b6 4 describes conditions that could raise a security concern under Guideline \nA and may be disqualifying:  \n \n(a) involvement in, support of, training to commit, or advocacy of any act \nof sabotage, espionage, treason, terrorism, or sedition against the United \nStates; \n \n(b) association or sympathy with persons who are attempting to commit, or \nwho are committing, any of the above acts; and \n \n(c) association or sympathy with persons or organizations that advocate, \nthreaten, or use force or violence, or use any other illegal or \nunconstitutional means, in an effort to: \n \n(1) overthrow or influence the U.S. Government or any state or \nlocal government; \n \n(2) prevent Federal, state, or local government personnel from \nperforming their official duties; \n \n(3) gain retribution for perceived wrongs caused by the Federal, \nstate, or local government; and \n \n(4) prevent others from exercising their rights under the Constitution \nor laws of the United States or of any state. \n \nUnder Guideline A, the Government alleges that until at least January 2015, \nApplicant was a member, high-ranking officer of Group X, an organization that allegedly \nadvocates sedition against the U.S. government, the use of force and violence to \noverthrow and influence the U.S. government, and to prevent others from exercising \ntheir lawful, constitutional rights. (SOR \u00b6 1.a)  \n \nIn his Answer to the SOR, Applicant acknowledged that he had been a member \nof Group X, but denied the characterizations and aims of the group as alleged. \nApplicant\u2019s answer puts the burden on the Government to establish that his past \nmembership of Group X is an ongoing, unresolved security concern. \n \nFirst, the Government did not establish, nor did they argue, that Applicant has \nplaced \u201cthe welfare or interests of another country above those of the United States.\u201d \n(AG \u00b6 3) No foreign country or entity is involved.  \n \nSecond, though Applicant himself has a 25-year-old criminal record, the \nGovernment neither alleged nor established under Guideline A that Applicant\u2019s \u201cfailure \n\n \n13 \n \n \nto adhere to the laws of the United States\u201d or \u201cviolation of law is harmful to stated U.S. \ninterests.\u201d (AG \u00b6 3) Indeed, the Government did not allege or establish under Guideline \nA that either Applicant or anyone connected with Group X has violated the law or that \ntheir actions in that capacity were unlawful.  \n \nGovernment Exhibit 10 is a reported federal appellate case, published in 1983. \nGovernment\u2019s Exhibits 7 and 8 are newsletters published by Group X in 1990 and 1994, \nrespectively, containing \u201cCommentary\u201d from the Group\u2019s founder, now deceased. \nApplicant joined Group X in about 2000, several years after these exhibits were \npublished. Although they describe Group X\u2019s historical views and aims, I give them little \nweight, as they have little to no direct link to Applicant, given their age. By contrast, \nApplicant confirmed in his testimony that the views and beliefs of Group X, as \nexpressed in GE 9, the 2018 website excerpt, were the views of and beliefs of the group \nwhen he was on the board. Thus, I give GE 9 greater weight. I have not relied on GE \n11, the Canadian court case, at all.  \n \nApplicant became a \u201cskinhead\u201d in about 1991, during his teenage years. By \n2000, when he gave a sworn statement to DSS, he was an avowed white supremacist. \nHe researched similar information on the internet, and passed out similar literature to \nthe public. Soon thereafter, he joined Group X, an organization advocating white \nsupremacy and white separatism, and which has a history of espousing racist, anti-\nSemitic and homophobic beliefs, as well as advocating violence against other races, \neven outright genocide. Applicant attended group meetings and engaged in recruiting \nefforts. He recruited his cohabitant into membership. For a time, his interest in Group X \nfaded as they began to raise their family.  \n \nIn 2012, Applicant reengaged with Group X when he was asked to join the board \nof directors. He became the group\u2019s vice-president and treasurer. He was also its \n\u201cregistered agent\u201d in State 1 and Group X\u2019s registered address was the same as \nApplicant\u2019s home. Applicant filed the group\u2019s annual report with State 1 regulatory \nauthorities in 2012. He attended board meetings several times a year. The Government \nhas established that Applicant is a former \u201cmember and high-ranking officer\u201d of Group \nX, as alleged.  \n \nAt hearing, Applicant acknowledged that, being an officer and director of Group \nX, he was a group leader, and represented the organization\u2019s beliefs. Unlike GE 7 and \nGE 8, which he disavowed, Applicant acknowledged that Group X\u2019s views and beliefs \nas expressed in GE 9, the 2018 website excerpt, were their beliefs when Applicant was \na member of the Group. \n \nApplicant testified that when he was on the board, he attempted to influence \nGroup X\u2019s belief system by making it less adversarial towards others. This led, he said, \nto a change in the bylaws, and, ultimately, to a lawsuit over the Group\u2019s future direction, \nin about 2014, in which Applicant was a party. He testified that around this time, in \nMarch 2014, he submitted a resignation letter. All of this is uncorroborated. \n \n\n \n14 \n \n \nApplicant disclosed the lawsuit on GE 1, in December 2014, naming several \nother individuals, some of whom were Group X officers. He was still listed with State 1\u2019s \nregulatory authority as the Group X registered agent as of January 2015.  \n \nThe Government argues that Applicant\u2019s prior involvement in Group X is a \nsecurity concern because Group X advocates \u201csedition\u201d and the \u201coverthrow\u201d of the \nUnited States Government. It cites to certain passages in the record evidence, in \npublications in which Group X asserts, for instance, that the U.S. Government is a \n\u201cmalignant monster\u201d that has become \u201cthe single most dangerous and destructive \nenemy our race has ever known.\u201d  \n \nIn reviewing Group X\u2019s materials, particularly GE 9, I conclude that the \nGovernment has not established that Group X advocates sedition or \u201coverthrow\u201d of the \nU.S. Government, at least with any specificity, let alone with a stated plan of action, \nviolently or otherwise. In essence, Group X advocates, in a way that is vociferous and \ninflammatory, but also vague and conclusory, for a government that is more receptive to \ntheir white supremacist and white separatist views and beliefs, abhorrent and offensive \nthough those views and beliefs surely are.  \n \nApplicant denied Group X advocated sedition against the United States \nGovernment, or sought to \u201coverthrow\u201d it, by violence or other means. He also noted \nseveral times, in his testimony and his Answer, that Group X had a policy forbidding its \nmembers from committing illegal acts. He also testified that if he believed Group X \nadvocated violence, sedition, or overthrow of the U.S. government, he would not have \njoined it.  \n \nWhile the federal appellate opinion in the record (GE 10) is quite dated, some of \nthe court\u2019s findings about the limitations of Group X\u2019s advocacy in 1983 remain apt here. \nThe court found that Group X \u201cfailed to present any reasoned development of its \nconclusions\u201d in its publications; and that \u201cits principal function was the mere \npresentation of unsupported opinion.\u201d The same can be said for the views expressed in \nthe 2018 website excerpt. As such, the Government\u2019s evidence about Group X, and \nabout Applicant\u2019s connections to it, is insufficient to establish that AG \u00b6\u00b6 4(a), 4(b), or \n4(c)(1), 4(c)(2), 4(c)(3), or 4(c)(4) should apply.  \n \n \nI might have reached a different conclusion as to AG \u00b6 4(c) if the record \ncontained evidence that Group X members actually engaged in acts of violence or other \nillegal activity that contradicted their disavowals, or if Applicant, while a Group X \nmember, did so himself. There is no such evidence.  \n \nTo be sure, Applicant does have a history of attempting to \u201cprevent others from \nexercising their rights under the Constitution or laws of the United States or of any \nstate.\u201d Felony willful and malicious defacement of a black church with Nazi references \nand the \u201cN word\u201d surely qualifies under AG \u00b6 4(c)(4), as it was an act seeking to \nintimidate members of the church community and to prevent them from exercising their \nFirst Amendment rights to freedom of speech, religion, association, and assembly. But \n\n \n15 \n \n \nthat conduct was not alleged under Guideline A. I may consider it under Guideline E \nand the whole-person concept, but not here.  \n \nLastly, in considering the strength of the Government\u2019s Guideline A case, it is \nnoteworthy that the Government, while arguing that Applicant was a member of an \norganization that advocated violence, illegal activity, sedition, and the overthrow of the \nU.S. government, did not allege falsification when Applicant did not disclose his \nmembership in Group X on his SCA, despite several questions calling for disclosure of \nmembership of organizations with such aims.  \n \nFor all of these reasons, I conclude that the Government did not meet its burden \nto establish a security concern under either the Guideline A \u201cgeneral concern\u201d or any of \nthe possible disqualifying conditions. SOR \u00b6 1.a is found for Applicant. Having so \nconcluded, I need not address applicability of the Guideline A mitigating conditions, \ndetailed under AG \u00b6 5.  \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \n \n \nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the security concern for personal conduct: \n \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative proceedings. . . \n \n  \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. The following disqualifying conditions are potentially applicable: \n \n(c) credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas \nthat is not sufficient for an adverse determination under any other \nsingle guideline, but which, when considered as a whole, supports a \nwhole-person \nassessment \nof \nquestionable \njudgment, \nuntrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply \nwith rules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that the \nindividual may not properly safeguard classified or sensitive \ninformation; and  \n \n(d) credible adverse information that is not explicitly covered under any \nother guideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an adverse \ndetermination, \nbut which, \nwhen combined with all available \ninformation, supports a whole-person assessment of questionable \njudgment, \nuntrustworthiness, \nunreliability, \nlack \nof \ncandor, \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations, or other \ncharacteristics indicating that the individual may not properly \n\n \n16 \n \n \nsafeguard classified or sensitive information. This includes, but is not \nlimited to, consideration of: . . . \n \n(2) any disruptive, violent, or other inappropriate behavior; \n \n \n \n(3) a pattern of dishonesty or rule violations; . . .  \n \n \n \n(e) personal conduct, or concealment of information about one's conduct, \nthat creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress by a \nforeign intelligence entity or other individual or group. Such conduct \nincludes: \n \n(1) engaging in activities which, if known, could affect the person's \npersonal, professional, or community standing; . . .[and]  \n \n \n(g) association with persons involved in criminal activity. \n \nBetween 1991 and 1994, Applicant was arrested for several criminal offenses. \n(SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.c \u2013 2.g) These offenses were not alleged under the criminal conduct \nadjudicative guideline (Guideline J, AG \u00b6 30), but might have been. Under Guideline E, \nthey satisfy the \u201ccatch-all\u201d AGs, \u00b6\u00b6 16(c), 16(d)(2) (for disruptive, inappropriate, and at \ntimes violent behavior), 16(d)(3) (a pattern of rule violations); 16(e)(1), and 16(g), as \nwell as the \u201cgeneral concern\u201d under Guideline E, AG \u00b6 15 (conduct involving \nquestionable judgment and unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations).  \n \nSimilarly, Applicant\u2019s use of marijuana (SOR \u00b6 2.b) was not alleged under \nGuideline H, the drug involvement adjudicative guideline (AG \u00b6 24) but might have \nbeen. The above AGs under Guideline E are also satisfied as to that allegation. \n \nSOR \u00b6 2.a cross-alleges Applicant\u2019s prior membership and high-level \ninvolvement in Group X as a personal conduct security concern. As an initial matter, an \napplicant\u2019s security-related conduct may be alleged under more than one guideline, \nand, in an appropriate case, may be given independent weight under different \nguidelines. (See ISCR Case No. 04-09251 at 3 (App. Bd. Mar. 27, 2007)) It is also \nlegally permissible for an administrative judge to consider an applicant\u2019s conduct under \nboth and to reach different conclusions under both, so long as the judge articulates a \nrational basis for each. (See id.)  \n \nAs discussed at length above, I did not find that any disqualifying conditions \nunder Guideline A were applicable. Nevertheless, Applicant\u2019s membership in Group X \n(from about 2000 to early 2015) and participation as an officer and director of Group X \n(from 2012 to early 2015) is a potential security concern under Guideline E.  \n \n \nGroup X advocates white supremacy and separatism. Applicant, a self-described \n\u201cskinhead\u201d and white supremacist, joined the group in 2000. Though his interest waned \nfor a time, in 2012, he became an officer and director of the group in 2012, as well as its \n\n \n17 \n \n \nregistered agent in State 1. The Group X office address in State 1 was Applicant\u2019s \npersonal residence.  \n \n \nThere is no specific prohibition against associating with such groups. However, \nApplicant\u2019s membership in Group X and his high-level participation calls into question \nhis awareness of potential security concerns, as well as his judgment.  \n \nFor instance, Applicant\u2019s acknowledgment at hearing that he deliberately waited \nuntil after his March 2000 interview statement to join Group X so he would not have to \neither declare his membership in the group, or lie to the interviewing agent about it, is \nparticularly troubling. The deliberateness of Applicant\u2019s thought process in that instance \nserves to bolster the case that he knew his membership in the Group X was, or at least \nmight be, a security concern.  \n \nThen, of course, Applicant not only joined the Group as a member (later in 2000), \nhe became an officer and director. As such, as he acknowledged, he was a group \nleader, and represented the organization\u2019s beliefs. (Tr. 94) He also confirmed in his \ntestimony that Group X\u2019s beliefs, as detailed in GE 9, the 2018 website excerpt, were \ntheir beliefs when Applicant was a member of the Group.  \n \nThe Directive presumes a nexus between admitted or proved conduct under any \nof the Guidelines and an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a clearance. See, e.g. ISCR Case No. \n15-01253 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2016). The required nexus is shown because several \nGuideline E disqualifying conditions apply.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s membership in Group X and his deepening involvement as an officer \nand director, all of which occurred after his 2000 security interview, establish AG \u00b6\u00b6 \n16(c), 16(d); 16(e)(1), as well as the \u201cgeneral concern\u201d under Guideline E, AG \u00b6 15 for \nquestionable judgment.  \n \nIt is not sufficiently established that Applicant\u2019s membership in and leadership of \nGroup X constitutes association with persons involved in criminal activity. As to SOR \u00b6 \n2.a, AG \u00b6 16(g) is not established.  \n \nAG \u00b6 17 sets forth potentially applicable mitigating conditions under Guideline E:   \n \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the \nbehavior is so infrequent, or it happened under such unique \ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the \nindividual's reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained \ncounseling to change the behavior or taken other positive steps to \nalleviate the stressors, circumstances or factors that contributed to \nuntrustworthy, unreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such \nbehavior is unlikely to recur; and  \n\n \n18 \n \n \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate \nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress.  \n \nApplicant was arrested several times between 1991 and 1994. Most of these \noffenses occurred when he was in high school. Applicant has not had any arrests since \nthen. While Applicant\u2019s defacement of the black church in August 1994 requires further \nanalysis, his other, earlier offenses (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.c-2.f) are mitigated by the passage of \ntime, under AG \u00b6\u00b6 17(c) and 17(d).  \n \nApplicant\u2019s felony willful and malicious defacement of the black church, however, \nis a different matter. Despite its age (25 years ago), the offense\u2019s racial context remains \nrelevant to this case, given Applicant\u2019s admitted beliefs about white supremacy and \nwhite separatism (in a 2000 statement) his subsequent long-time membership in an \navowed white supremacist and white separatist group, and his participation as an officer \nand board member of the group from 2012 to 2015. It is therefore harder to mitigate \nSOR \u00b6 2.g on the basis of passage of time. His recent membership and involvement in \nsuch a group significantly limits any claim that Applicant is fully reformed and \nrehabilitated. He also testified at hearing that at the time he committed the act, he did \nnot know it was a black church. Given the record evidence of what was written on the \nchurch, this is simply not credible. AG \u00b6\u00b6 17(c) and 17(d) do not apply to mitigate SOR \n\u00b6 2.g.  \n \nApplicant became a self-described \u201cskinhead\u201d in about 1991. By 2000, he was an \navowed white supremacist. He joined Group X, an organization advocating white \nsupremacy and white separatism, and which has a history of espousing racist, anti-\nSemitic and homophobic beliefs. As already discussed, he deliberately waited until after \nhis 2000 background interview to join Group X, so he would not have to disclose his \nmembership to the interviewing agent, or would have to lie to avoid doing so.  \n \nApplicant was a member of Group X member for about 15 years (2000-2015) \nand was an officer and director of the Group from 2012-2015. He had longtime and \ndeep involvement. He said that he resigned in 2014, and is no longer involved with the \ngroup or its members. (With respect to his beliefs on white supremacy, Applicant did not \nactually disavow those beliefs during his testimony. Instead, he testified that he \u201ccan\u2019t \nbe\u201d a white supremacist because he learned he has a Native American ancestor). \n \nApplicant testified that he \u201cphilosophically\u201d left Group X in about 2009. However, \nthe record also makes clear that in fact his involvement later deepened, as between \n2012 and January 2015, he was an officer and director of Group X, its registered agent \nin State 1, and Group X\u2019\u2019s registered office in State 1 was the same as his residence.  \n \nThus, there is record evidence of two separate instances, many years apart, of \nApplicant\u2019s lack of candor to the government about his involvement with Group X. In \naddition, it is noteworthy that in his answer to the SOR, Applicant acknowledged his \nprior membership in Group X, but did not address his involvement as an officer or \ndirector.  \n\n \n19 \n \n \nI may not consider these instances of Applicant\u2019s lack of candor as disqualifying \nconduct, since they were not alleged in the SOR. However, I may consider them in \nweighing mitigation or changed circumstances, whether Applicant has demonstrated \nsufficient rehabilitation, under the whole person concept, and, most importantly here, in \nweighing Applicant\u2019s credibility. ISCR Case No. 03-20327 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, 2006).  \n \nApplicant submitted no documentary evidence to corroborate any of his \ntestimony. No character witnesses testified on his behalf. His case in mitigation, \nparticularly as to his connections to Group X, therefore rests entirely on his own \ncredibility. This makes Applicant\u2019s multiple instances of lack of candor, particularly \nproblematic.  \n \n \nApplicant has a constitutional right to believe whatever he wants. He has a \nconstitutional right to associate with whomever he wants. He does not have a \nconstitutional right to a clearance. (See Egan, 484 U.S. at 528). To be determined \neligible for access to classified information, Applicant must rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate security significant conduct or circumstances established by the Government \nand he has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.  \n \nI have doubts about the credibility of Applicant\u2019s uncorroborated testimony that \nhe is no longer a member of Group X, and has disassociated himself from it. (For \ninstance, Applicant acknowledged that, while he has covered up most of his white \nsupremacist and skinhead tattoos, he has one left \u2013 the number \u201c88,\u201d which he \nacknowledged was a symbol of skinhead culture. That tattoo remains \u2013 under his \nponytail, where no one can see it.) My doubts are exacerbated by his multiple instances \nof lack of candor to the Government about his connections to Group X, which stretch \nfrom his March 2000 statement to his testimony in this hearing.  \n \nThese instances of lack of candor towards the Government about Applicant\u2019s \ninvolvement with Group X call into question the truthfulness of his testimony that he has \nresigned form Group X, that he is no longer associated with Group X or any of its \nmembers. The fact that Applicant evidenced lack of candor, including at hearing, about \nthe recency of his involvement with Group X calls the very recency of his involvement \nwith the group into question and causes doubt over whether his involvement with Group \nX and its beliefs is as in the past as he says it is. As to SOR \u00b6 2.a, Applicant did not \nprovide sufficient evidence to mitigate SOR \u00b6 2.a under AG \u00b6\u00b6 17(c), 17(d), or 17(e).  \n \nThis leaves Applicant\u2019s marijuana use. (SOR \u00b6 2.b). Applicant used marijuana \nmostly in high school, but resumed using it from 2005 to 2013. He testified that he has \nnot used it since. Applicant\u2019s marijuana use is not particularly recent. However, he is \naround marijuana weekly, with members of his band. Applicant acknowledged his \nunderstanding that marijuana remains illegal under federal law, and under the law of his \nhome state. Ordinarily, Applicant\u2019s marijuana might be mitigated by the passage of time. \nHowever, given my conclusions about Applicant\u2019s lack of candor, addressed above, his \nuncorroborated testimony that he avoids marijuana use despite being around it weekly, \nis not enough to assuage my doubts that SOR \u00b6 2.b is fully mitigated under AG \u00b6 17(a).  \n\n \n20 \n \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.  \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments \nunder Guidelines A and E in my whole-person analysis. Applicant, through his \nuncorroborated testimony, did not provide sufficient evidence to meet his burden of \nrelieving all doubts about his security significant conduct. He has not met his burden of \nestablishing that it is clearly consistent with the national interest that he be granted \naccess to classified information. Overall, the record evidence leaves me with questions \nand doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility for continued access to classified information.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline A:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:   \n \nFor Applicant  \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:   \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 2.a, 2.b, 2.g:  \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraphs 2.c-2.f:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \n \n\n \n21 \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented, it is not clearly consistent with the \nnational security interests of the United States to grant Applicant access to classified \ninformation. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.  \n \n                                     \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nBraden M. Murphy \nAdministrative Judge \n",

Eligibility for access to sensitive \ninformation is denied.  \nStatement of the Case \nOn February 2, 2017, the Department of Defense (DOD) issued a Statement of \nReasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing trustworthiness concerns under Guideline C, \nforeign preference, and Guideline B, foreign influence. The action was taken under \nDOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review \nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines \n(AG) implemented by the DOD on September 1, 2006.1 \nApplicant answered the SOR on July 25, 2017 (Answer), and elected to have a \nhearing before an administrative judge. The case was assigned to me on June 13, \n2018. The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a notice of hearing \n1 I decided this case using the AG implemented by DOD on June 8, 2017.

He indicated that when he traveled to Egypt, he did so on his U.S. passport; upon \narrival in Egypt, he used his Egyptian passport as identification to show that he was an \nEgyptian citizen, because it was convenient for him to do so. He relinquished his \nEgyptian passport to his facility security officer (FSO) when he received the SOR in \n2017. He testified that he had no intentions of retrieving his Egyptian passport from his \nFSO or obtaining another Egyptian passport in the future.6 \n \nApplicant\u2019s second ex-wife is a citizen and resident of Egypt; their son is a dual \ncitizen of the United States and Egypt, residing with Applicant\u2019s second ex-wife in Egypt \n(SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.a, 2.b). Applicant married his second ex-wife in Egypt. He sponsored her \nmove to the United States, but she never became a U.S. citizen.

His former mother-in-law and sister are employed by the \nEgyptian government, and his one brother was formerly employed by the Egyptian \ngovernment (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.c - 2.g). He has not spoken to his former mother-in-law since his \n2017 divorce. He indicated in his SCA that she worked for the Egyptian government. He \ntestified that he visits his family in Egypt approximately once every two to three years, \nand he did so in 2009, 2010, 2011, 2012, 2014 and 2016. He planned to visit them less \nin the future, and testified that he would do so using his U.S. passport. He testified that \nnone of his family in Egypt are aware that he is seeking to maintain his eligibility for \naccess to sensitive information, and do not know the nature of his work.8 \n \nApplicant\u2019s mother is 79 years old. His 54-year-old brother lives with her. She \nhas never worked outside of the home. Applicant\u2019s father was a teacher for the Egyptian \nDepartment of Education (DOE); he died when Applicant was 14 years old.

With help from his mother and \nsiblings, he purchased it for approximately $10,000 USD from his 60-year-old brother, \nwith the idea that he would use it with his family when he traveled to Egypt. He sold it \nfor $25,000 USD to a distant relative, and he gave all of the proceeds to his family in \nEgypt. At the time of his SCA, he also had a bank account in Egypt. He opened it with \n$200 USD between 2012 and 2014. He had returned to Egypt to live, while working as a \nmedical interpreter for a U.S. company and completing his master\u2019s degree, to spend \ntime with his then-wife and son and complete their paperwork to immigrate to the United \nStates. He opened the account in the event he needed to transfer money to the United \nStates. He testified that he never used it. He does not own any other foreign property or \nhave any other foreign financial interests. He testified that he does not stand to own his \nmother\u2019s property in Egypt, which will likely be inherited by his siblings who live there.16  \n \nAs of the date of the hearing, Applicant\u2019s annual salary was approximately \n$53,000. He was renting a room in the United States since 2016, in the home of a friend \nwho was also a prior roommate from 2006. He has leased a car for three years and \nplanned to buy it.

He does not have any other assets in the United States. He was not affiliated \nwith any foreign governments. He has received annual security training. He testified that \nhe would report any attempts to blackmail or his family to his FSO.17 \n \nA friend of Applicant since obtaining their certification together in 2011 testified \nthat Applicant is a solid and trustworthy man. Another friend, was Applicant\u2019s former \nroommate in 2006 and is Applicant\u2019s current landlord, held a public trust position as of \nthe date of the hearing. The witness testified that he met Applicant\u2019s brother in the \nUnited States on at least two occasions, and he previously met Applicant\u2019s ex-wife and \nchild. He testified that he did not believe Applicant to be a threat to the United States, \nand described Applicant as a trustworthy man. Applicant\u2019s supervisor since March 2017 \nstated that Applicant was a responsible caretaker of sensitive information and an asset \nto the team. She rated him favorably in his 2016 to 2017 performance evaluation. Other \ncharacter references described Applicant as a dedicated, compassionate, and honest \nindividual.18 \n \nEgypt \n \n \nThe U.S. Department of State warns U.S. citizens of threats from terrorist \ngroups in Egypt, and to consider the risks of travel to the country. A number of terrorist \ngroups, including the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) have committed multiple \ndeadly attacks in Egypt. U.S. diplomatic personnel are prohibited from travel in parts of \nEgypt, and U.S. citizens are warned to avoid those areas. \n                                                          \n16 Tr. at 41-77, 80-85, 93-94; GE 1, 2; AE D. \n \n17 Tr. at 41-78, 80-85; GE 1; AE G, H, I. \n \n18 Tr. at 94-108; AE F, G. \n\n \n6 \n \nSignificant human rights problems in Egypt include excessive use of force by \nsecurity forces; deficiencies in due process; and the suppression of civil liberties, \nincluding societal and government restrictions on freedoms of expression and the \npress, and the freedoms of peaceful assembly and association. Political protests occur \nwithout warning in Egypt. Demonstrations have led to frequent violent clashes between \npolice and protestors, resulting in deaths, injuries, and property damage. \n \nPolicies \n \nThe Under Secretary of Defense\u2019s Memorandum of November 19, 2004, treats \nADP positions as sensitive positions, and it entitles applicants for ADP positions to the \nprocedural protections in the Directive before any final unfavorable access \ndetermination may be made. The standard set out in the adjudicative guidelines for \nassignment to sensitive duties is that the person\u2019s loyalty, reliability, and trustworthiness \nare such that assigning the person to sensitive duties is clearly consistent with the \ninterests of national security. AG \u00b6 2.b.   \n \nA person who seeks access to sensitive information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. \nDecisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the applicant may \ndeliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard sensitive information.  \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a public trust position, the \nadministrative judge must consider the disqualifying and mitigating conditions in the AG. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of \nhuman behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the \nwhole person. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, \nimpartial and commonsense decision. An administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable.  \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. Under AG \n\u00b6 2(b), \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to [sensitive] \ninformation will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d The Government must present \nsubstantial evidence to establish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 \nE3.1.14. Once the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, \nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-\n31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). An applicant has the ultimate burden of \ndemonstrating that it is clearly consistent with national security to grant or continue \neligibility for access to sensitive information.  \n \n \n \n \n\n \n7 \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline C, Foreign Preference \n \nThe trustworthiness concern for foreign preference is set out in AG \u00b6 9: \n \nWhen an individual acts in such a way as to indicate a preference for a \nforeign country over the United States, then he or she may provide \ninformation or make decisions that are harmful to the interests of the \nUnited States. Foreign involvement raises concerns about an individual\u2019s \njudgment, reliability, and trustworthiness when it is in conflict with U.S. \nnational interests or when the individual acts to conceal it. By itself; the \nfact that a U.S. citizen is also a citizen of another country is not \ndisqualifying without an objective showing of such conflict or attempt at \nconcealment. The same is true for a U.S. citizen's exercise of any right or \nprivilege of foreign citizenship and any action to acquire or obtain \nrecognition of a foreign citizenship. \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise trustworthiness concerns   \nunder AG \u00b6 10. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n \n(a) applying for and/or acquiring citizenship in any other country; \n \n(b) failure to report, or fully disclose when required, to an appropriate \nsecurity official, the possession of a passport or identity card issued by \nany country other than the United States; \n \n(c) failure to use a U.S. passport when entering or exiting the U.S.; \n \n(d) participation in foreign activities, including but not limited to: \n \n(1) assuming or attempting to assume any type of employment, \nposition, or political office in a foreign government or military \norganization; and \n \n(2) otherwise acting to serve the interests of a foreign person, \ngroup, organization, or government in any way that conflicts with \nU.S. national security interests; and \n \n(e) using foreign citizenship to protect financial or business interests in \nanother country in violation of U.S. law. \n \nApplicant is an Egyptian citizen by virtue of being born there. There is no \nevidence that he failed to report or disclose to an appropriate security official his \npossession of an Egyptian passport, or that he failed to use his U.S. passport when \nentering or exiting the United States. He disclosed his Egyptian citizenship and passport \non his SCA and during his background interviews. He indicated that he traveled to \n\n \n8 \nEgypt on his U.S. passport, and he only presented his Egyptian passport upon arrival \nout of convenience, as identification that he was an Egyptian citizen. He surrendered his \nEgyptian passport to his FSO upon receipt of the SOR. There is no evidence that he \nparticipated in any foreign activities, or that he used his Egyptian citizenship to protect \nhis financial interests in Egypt in violation of U.S. law. He sold his property there in \n2016, and he credibly testified that he has not used his Egyptian bank account since he \nopened it between 2012 and 2014. None of the potentially disqualifying conditions \nunder AG \u00b6 10 are established, and I find SOR \u00b6 1.a in Applicant\u2019s favor. \n \nGuideline B, Foreign Influence \n \nThe trustworthiness concern for foreign influence is set out in AG \u00b6 6: \n \nForeign contacts and interests, including, but not limited to, business, \nfinancial, and property interests, are a trustworthiness concern if they \nresult in divided allegiance. They may also be a trustworthiness concern if \nthey create circumstances in which the individual may be manipulated or \ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a \nway inconsistent with U.S. interests or otherwise made vulnerable to \npressure or coercion by any foreign interest. Assessment of foreign \ncontacts and interests should consider the country in which the foreign \ncontact or interest is located, including, but not limited to, considerations \nsuch as whether it is known to target U.S. citizens to obtain classified or \nsensitive information or is associated with a risk of terrorism. \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise trustworthiness concerns   \nunder AG \u00b6 7. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n \n(a) contact, regardless of method, with a foreign family member, business \nor professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or \nresident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of \nforeign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; \n \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual\u2019s obligation to \nprotect classified or sensitive information or technology and the \nindividual\u2019s desire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing \nthat information or technology; and \n \n(f) substantial business, financial, or property interests in a foreign country, \nor in any foreign owned or foreign-operated business that could subject \nthe individual to a heightened risk of foreign influence or exploitation or \npersonal conflict of interest. \n \nApplicant sold his property in Egypt in 2016. He credibly testified that he has not \nused his Egyptian bank account since he opened it between 2012 and 2014. AG \u00b6 7(f) \nis not established, and I find SOR \u00b6 2.h in Applicant\u2019s favor. \n\n \n9 \nGuideline B is not limited to countries hostile to the United States. \u201cThe \nUnited States has a compelling interest in protecting and safeguarding sensitive \ninformation from any person, organization, or country that is not authorized to have \naccess to it, regardless of whether that person, organization, or country has \ninterests inimical to those of the United States.\u201d  ISCR Case No. 02-11570 at 5 (App. \nBd. May 19, 2004). Furthermore, \u201ceven friendly nations can have profound \ndisagreements with the United States over matters they view as important to their \nvital interests or national security.\u201d ISCR Case No. 00-0317, 2002 DOHA LEXIS 83 at \n**15-16 (App. Bd. Mar. 29, 2002). Finally, we know friendly nations have engaged in \nespionage against the United States, especially in the economic, scientific, and \ntechnical fields.  \n \nNevertheless, the nature of a nation\u2019s government, its relationship with the \nUnited States, and its human rights record are relevant in assessing the likelihood \nthat an applicant\u2019s family members are vulnerable to government coercion. The risk \nof coercion, persuasion, or duress is significantly greater if the foreign country has \nan authoritarian government, a family member is associated with or dependent upon \nthe government, or the country is known to conduct intelligence operations against the \nUnited States. In considering the nature of the government, an administrative judge \nmust also consider any terrorist activity in the country at issue. See generally ISCR \nCase No. 02-26130 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 7, 2006) (reversing decision to grant \nclearance where administrative judge did not consider terrorist activity in area where \nfamily members resided). \n \nAG \u00b6 7(a) requires substantial evidence of a \u201cheightened risk.\u201d The \u201cheightened \nrisk\u201d required to raise one of these disqualifying conditions is a relatively low standard. \n\u201cHeightened risk\u201d denotes a risk greater than the normal risk inherent in having a family \nmember living under a foreign government. Applicant has not spoken to his mother-in-\nlaw since he divorced his second wife in 2017. In addition, his one brother was also no \nlonger employed by the Egyptian government as of the date of the hearing.  AG \u00b6\u00b6 7(a) \nand 7(b) are not established as to SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.d and 2.f, and I find SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.d and 2.f in \nApplicant\u2019s favor.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s mother, one brother, sister, second ex-wife, and son, are citizens and \nresidents of Egypt. His sister is employed by the Egyptian government. His three other \nbrothers who are citizens of Egypt and resided in Egypt at the time of the SOR, no longer \nresided there as of the date of the hearing; though the wives and children for at least two \nof these three brothers did. While Applicant divorced his second wife in 2017, she is the \nmother of their minor son. Though he indicated that he has not had contact with either \nhis second wife or their son since 2015, he provides monthly financial support for his \nson. Terrorist activities and significant human rights abuses are present in Egypt. \nApplicant\u2019s foreign contacts in Egypt create a potential conflict of interest and a \nheightened risk of foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, and \ncoercion. AG \u00b6\u00b6 7(a) and 7(b) have been raised by the evidence as to SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.a, 2.b, \n2.c, 2.e, and 2.g. \n \n \n\n \n10 \nConditions that could mitigate foreign influence trustworthiness concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 8. The following are potentially applicable: \n \n(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in \nwhich these persons are located, or the positions or activities of those \npersons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be \nplaced in a position of having to choose between the interests of a foreign \nindividual, group, organization, or government and the interests of the \nUnited States; \n \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of \nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, or allegiance to the group, \ngovernment, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such deep and \nlongstanding relationships and loyalties in the United States, that the \nindividual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the \nU.S. interest; and \n \n(c) contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and \ninfrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign \ninfluence or exploitation. \n \nAG \u00b6 8(a) is not established for the reasons set out in the above discussion \nof AG \u00b6\u00b6 7(a) and 7(b). AG \u00b6 8(c) is also not established, as Applicant visited his \nfamily in Egypt once every year to two between 2009 and 2016. He communicates with \nhis mother once every two to three weeks. He communicates with his brother and sister \nwho reside in Egypt once every month to four months. He provided financial support to \nhis one brother in 2018, so that this brother could support his wife and children in Egypt. \nAs previously discussed, though he divorced his second wife in 2017 and indicated that \nhe has not had contact with either her or their minor son since 2015, he provides \nmonthly financial support for his son.  \n \nApplicant has lived and worked in the United States since 2000. He received a \nlanguage certificate and a master\u2019s degree in the United States. He became a \nnaturalized U.S. citizen in 2008. Though he has a bank account in Egypt, he stated that \nhe has not used it since he opened it between 2012 and 2014, and he sold his property \nin Egypt in 2016. His financial interests in the United States, on the other hand, include \nhis annual salary of $53,000, and his retirement and bank accounts totaling \napproximately $14,800. These are factors that weigh in Applicant\u2019s favor. However, \nApplicant\u2019s ties to his family in Egypt are equally as strong. Applicant failed to meet his \nburden to demonstrate that he would resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the U.S. \ninterest. AG \u00b6 8(b) is not established. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a public trust position by considering the totality of the \n\n \n11 \napplicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should \nconsider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \npublic trust position must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.        \n \nI have incorporated my comments under Guidelines C and B in my whole-person \nanalysis. After weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under both \nguidelines, and evaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole person, I \nconclude Applicant has mitigated the foreign preference trustworthiness concerns, but \nhe has not mitigated the trustworthiness concerns raised by his ex-wife, son, mother, \none brother, and sister in Egypt. Accordingly, I conclude he has not carried his burden \nof showing that it is clearly consistent with national security to grant him eligibility for \naccess to sensitive information. \n \nFormal Findings \n \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR:  \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline C:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline B:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraphs 2.a - 2.c:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nSubparagraph 2.d:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \nSubparagraph 2.e:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nSubparagraph 2.f:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \nSubparagraph 2.g:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nSubparagraph 2.h:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n12 \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a public trust \nposition. Eligibility for access to sensitive information is denied. \n \n \n \n \n \n_______________________ \nCandace Le\u2019i Garcia \nAdministrative Judge \n",

Savarino, Esq. \n______________ \nDecision \n______________ \nGARCIA, Candace Le\u2019i, Administrative Judge: \nApplicant did not mitigate the personal conduct, use of information technology, \nand foreign influence security concerns. Eligibility for access to classified information is \ndenied. \nStatement of the Case \nOn February 14, 2017, the Department of Defense (DOD) issued a Statement of \nReasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing security concerns under Guideline E (personal \nconduct), Guideline M (use of information technology), and Guideline B (foreign \ninfluence). The action was taken under Executive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; \nDOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review \nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines \n(AG).1 \n1 I decided this case using the AG implemented by DOD on June 8, 2017. However, I also considered this \ncase under the previous AG implemented on September 1, 2006, and my conclusions are the same using \neither set of AG. \n12/27/2018\n\n \n2 \n \nApplicant responded to the SOR on March 15, 2017, and requested a hearing. \nThe case was assigned to me on November 9, 2017. The Defense Office of Hearings \nand Appeals (DOHA) issued a notice of hearing (NOH) on December 8, 2017, \nscheduling the hearing for January 22, 2018. A notice of cancellation for that hearing \nwas issued on January 19, 2018, due to the U.S. Government shutdown. A second \nNOH was issued on April 9, 2018, scheduling the hearing for May 18, 2018. I convened \nthe hearing as scheduled.2 \n \nI marked the Government\u2019s discovery letter, request for administrative notice, \nand exhibit list as Hearing Exhibits (HE) I, II, and III, and Applicant\u2019s exhibit list as HE \nIV. Government Exhibits (GE) 1 through 5 were admitted in evidence without objection. \nApplicant testified, called one witness, and submitted Applicant\u2019s Exhibits (AE) A \nthrough N, which were admitted in evidence without objection. DOHA received the \nhearing transcript (Tr.) on June 6, 2018.  \n                                                                                                                                                       \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant admitted the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 3.a, 3.b, and 3.c. He denied \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b and 2.a. He is 50 years old. He married in 2000, divorced in 2009, and \nremarried in 2010. He has four minor children. All are native-born U.S. citizens. His \neldest child is from a prior relationship. His second child is from his prior marriage. His \nyoungest two children are from his current marriage.3  \n \n \nApplicant graduated from high school in 1986. He earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in \n1990 and a master\u2019s degree in 2002. He served in the U.S. Navy from 1990 to 1994, \nwhen he was honorably discharged. He has since worked for various defense \ncontractors. As of the date of the hearing, he worked as a senior engineer for his current \nemployer, for whom he has worked since late February 2015. He previously worked for \nthe same company from June 2007 to February 2009. He was first granted a security \nclearance in 1990.4  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s wife was born in Russia. She is 33 years old. She earned a \nbachelor\u2019s and a master\u2019s degree from a university in Russia in around 2002 and 2009, \nrespectively. She first immigrated to the United States in 2004. She then returned to \nRussia, where she married her first spouse, who was then a Russian citizen, in 2005. \nHer first spouse is now a U.S. citizen residing in the United States. They immigrated to \nthe United States in 2005 and divorced in 2007. She remarried a Ukrainian national in \n2009 and they lived together in the United States. She then returned to Russia in 2009 \nfor one month to finish her master\u2019s degree, after which time she returned to the United \nStates. She divorced her second spouse in 2010.5 \n                                                     \n2 Tr. at 7-8. \n \n3 Response to the SOR; Tr. at 36, 39-41, 75, 77, 85; GE 1, 2; AE D, K, N.                    \n \n4 Tr. at 36-39, 43-51, 97-98; GE 1, 2; AE A, D, F. \n \n5 Tr. at 78-90, 94-97, 105-112; GE 1, 2; AE B, D, K, L, M, N. \n\n \n3 \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s wife became a naturalized U.S. citizen in 2014. She renounced her \nRussian citizenship in 2016. She has worked as a business financial manager for an \nengineering firm since May 2015. The company\u2019s partner, who is also the facility \nsecurity officer (FSO), indicated that while Applicant\u2019s wife does not need a security \nclearance, she has received security training like those who do. He described her as a \nvalued and trusted employee who safeguards the company\u2019s confidential, sensitive, and \nproprietary information. He also indicated that she appears to be a loyal American \ncitizen.6 \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s parents-in-law and brother-in-law are citizens and residents of \nRussia. His parents-in-law divorced in 2010. His father-in-law is 60 years old. Applicant \ntestified that his wife\u2019s father is estranged from the family. She talks to her father several \ntimes yearly, and she has seen him three times between 2008 and 2018. Her father met \nher during one of her trips to Russia so that he could meet his grandson. Applicant has \nnever met or talked to his father-in-law. Applicant is unaware whether his father-in-law is \ncurrently employed, and his wife believes her father is retired. Applicant\u2019s father-in-law \nis a former Russian military officer. Applicant testified that his father-in-law served in the \nRussian military for several years from around 1983 to 1985, before he was discharged \nfor stealing rubbing alcohol.7 \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s mother-in-law is 60 years old. She works as an accountant for a \nbrewery. His brother-in-law is 24 years old. After Applicant\u2019s brother-in-law graduated \nfrom college, he completed one year of mandatory service in the Russian military in \naround December 2017. He works as a chemist for a private pharmaceutical company. \nApplicant was unaware if his brother-in-law had any ongoing affiliations with the \nRussian government or military. Applicant\u2019s wife video chats with her mother once \nweekly. She is close to her brother and talks to him more frequently, at least several \ntimes weekly and most recently because of his imminent wedding. His mother-in-law \nspeaks \u201cvery little\u201d English and Applicant speaks \u201cvery little\u201d Russian, so he simply says \n\u201chello\u201d and ensures that his children do the same on the occasions that his wife talks to \nher mother. He has a similar relationship with his brother-in-law.8 \n \n \nApplicant traveled to Russia in 2010, 2011, 2013, and 2014. He followed security \nclearance protocol and reported such travels to his FSO. His wife travels to Russia once \nyearly, and she stays with her mother during such visits. Though Applicant planned to \ntravel to Russia with his family to attend his brother-in-law\u2019s wedding and celebrate his \n50th birthday, he elected not to do so while his clearance decision was pending. His wife \nand two children planned to attend her brother\u2019s wedding in Russia, where they would \nstay in a condominium paid for by her brother. His mother-in-law and brother-in-law \nhave visited and stayed with them in the United States. They did so before Applicant \nand his wife married, and his mother-in-law did so again after the birth of their son in \n                                                     \n6 Tr. at 78-90, 94-97, 105-112; GE 1, 2; AE B, D, K, L, M, N. \n \n7 Tr. at 78-90, 94-97, 105-112; GE 1, 2; AE D, L, M, N. \n \n8 Tr. at 78-90, 94-97, 105-112; GE 1, 2; AE D, L, M, N. \n\n \n4 \n \n2013 for six months. She has attempted to revisit them since but her visa has been \ndenied at least three times.9 \n \n \nIn around 2013, Applicant\u2019s mother-in-law sold her condominium in Russia, and \ngave $90,000 of the proceeds to Applicant and his wife, which they used as a deposit \nfor their home in the United States. Applicant reported this monetary gift to his FSO. \nThey have not received any additional money and his wife does not have standing to \ninherit any money from anyone in Russia. They do not have any assets, obligations, or \naffiliations in Russia. Their assets in the United States total around $1,840,000.10 \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s in-laws in Russia are aware that he works as an engineer. He has not \ntold them that he holds a security clearance or works on U.S. Government contracts. He \nis unaware if his wife has ever disclosed this information to them; she indicated that she \nhas not shared information about Applicant\u2019s work or need for a clearance to any \nforeign national, to include her mother and brother. Applicant is unaware whether his in-\nlaws in Russia have ever been approached by anyone in the Russian government or \nmilitary seeking information about him or his employment. He testified that he would \nreport to his FSO and the proper authorities any attempts by anyone in Russia to \nblackmail him.11 \n \n \nApplicant looked at pornography on his work computer from around February \n2014 through February 2015. At the time, he had been working for a subcontractor \nsince 2008. He attributed his actions to the \u201cgross miscalculation\u201d he made as a result \nof an \u201cextreme amount of stress\u201d from 2013 through 2015. His eldest child was born in \n2013 with a medical condition requiring multiple surgeries through 2015, as well as \ncontinuous checkups every six months indefinitely. He described this experience as a \n\u201ctraumatic\u201d one. In addition, he and his wife \u201cwere not in a good spot at all\u201d after she had \ndisclosed to him that she had multiple affairs between 2013 and 2015.12 \n \n \nInitially, Applicant only looked at pornography at home. When he became \naddicted to it, he also looked at pornography at work. He testified that pornography:   \n \n[w]as my outlet, that was my release. Whether it was five, ten minutes, \nyou know, before work started. Ten, 20, 30 minutes after work . . . before I \nwent home . . . It relaxed me. It prepared me for going home and having to \nwork through everything that was going on in the house. \n \nHe also acknowledged that he looked at pornography at work at lunch time. He \nestimated that he looked at pornography at work an average of 15 to 30 minutes daily. \n                                                     \n9 Tr. at 78-90, 94-97, 105-112; GE 1, 2; AE D, L, M, N. \n \n10 Tr. at 78-90, 94-97, 105-112; GE 1, 2, 5; AE A, D, E, L, M, N. \n \n11 Tr. at 78-90, 94-97, 105-112; GE 1, 2, 5; AE A, D, E, L, M, N. \n \n12 Tr. at 36-77, 90-93, 98-99; GE 1, 2, 3, 4, 5; AE G, N. \n\n \n5 \n \nHe maintained that it never interfered with his work. He did not tell anyone at the time \nthat he was looking at pornography at work because he knew it was improper.13 \n \n \nIn early February 2015, the primary defense contractor removed Applicant from \nthe U.S. Government contract to which he had been assigned through his subcontractor \ncompany. His program manager informed him that computer monitoring revealed that \nhe had been accessing pornography on his work computer. He immediately reported his \nremoval and the reason for his removal to his company\u2019s President, Vice President, and \nFSO. He was placed on administrative leave by his company during the two-week \nperiod in which the primary contractor conducted its investigation, then he was \nterminated by his company in around mid-February 2015.14  \n \n \nThe investigation conducted by the primary contractor, summarized in an April 2, \n2015 letter, consisted of a forensic examination of Applicant\u2019s computer, an interview of \nthe contract\u2019s technical lead, and a review of Applicant\u2019s time sheets, contract \ndocuments, and internet logs. Applicant was never interviewed. The investigation \ndetermined that Applicant viewed pornography during periods that were billed to the \nU.S. Government. As such, the primary contractor indicated that it would issue to the \nU.S. Government a credit of $21,577.15 \n \n \nApplicant denied that he ever mischarged to the government contract any time in \nwhich he looked at pornography at work. He testified that he was aware that the primary \ndefense contractor paid $20,000 to the U.S. Government agency in association with his \nalleged mischarging; his company repaid the primary contractor $20,000 at the latter\u2019s \nrequest; he was unaware how the amount of $20,000 was quantified; and he was never \nasked to repay any money. He acknowledged during his July 2016 background \ninterview that the $20,000 was restitution for an established 100 hours of computer use \nduring work hours for personal purposes. A May 2016 letter memorializing a meeting \nbetween Applicant, his attorney, and debarment officials, reflects that \u201cit was clear that \n[Applicant] has accepted responsibility for mischarging a government contract for \nmisspent time.\u201d16 \n \n \nApplicant was placed under surveillance for one year by his company\u2019s ethics \ncommittee from 2016 to 2017. He was required to report his time and his computer was \nmonitored, as further discussed below. He has had no other unfavorable issues. He \ntestified that it was not easy for him to stop looking at pornography at work. Once he \nwas terminated by his prior company, he sought help for the first time. He voluntarily \nattended multiple Sex Addicts Anonymous (SAA) meetings for two and a half years to \naddress his addiction. He no longer feels he is addicted to pornography, he intends to \ncontinue to attend SAA meetings in the future, and he does not intend to look at \n                                                     \n13 Tr. at 36-77, 90-94, 98-101; GE 2, 3, 4, 5. \n \n14 Tr. at 36-77, 90-93, 98-101; GE 1, 2, 3, 4, 5; AE A, F, G, H, I. \n \n15 Tr. at 56-77, 90-94, 98-101; GE 2, 3; AE H, I, J. \n \n16 Tr. at 36-77, 90-94, 98-104, 113-115; GE 1, 2, 3; AE A, F, G, H, I, J. \n\n \n6 \n \npornography on his work computer in the future. He eventually disclosed his conduct of \nviewing pornography at work and his consequent termination to his wife, who supports \nhis SAA attendance and has herself attended such meetings. He handles stress by \nworking out, playing games on his phone, and keeping busy with his family.17 \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s character witness was a vice president for the defense contractor for \nwhom they worked. He was also Applicant\u2019s division director and direct supervisor of \nthree years. He has held a security clearance at various occasions over a 30-year-\nperiod. Though the witness was not involved in rehiring Applicant, he testified that \nApplicant had self-reported his issue with his prior defense contracting company to both \nthe witness and his predecessor, and despite such knowledge, the predecessor chose \nto rehire Applicant. He testified that he was aware that Applicant viewed pornography \non his work computer during his off hours while employed by the prior defense \ncontractor; he self-reported his conduct to his then-employer; and Applicant had to \nleave that company after he was consequently removed from the contract. The witness \ntestified that he was unaware that any allegations were ever substantiated concerning \nApplicant mischarging his prior employer for time associated with his pornography \nusage at work.18 \n \n \nThe witness testified that he discussed the matter with an individual from \nApplicant\u2019s prior employer, who described Applicant\u2019s conduct as a mistake and \nindicated that Applicant had otherwise been trustworthy. The witness also testified that \nhe discussed the matter directly with Applicant and brought it to the attention of their \nemployer\u2019s ethics committee. The committee, noting that Applicant did not have any \nunfavorable issues during his previous employment with their company, placed \nApplicant on a one-year observation period beginning in around July 2016, which \ncoincided with Applicant\u2019s proposed debarment period.19  \n \n \nDuring this time, Applicant reported his time to the witness daily, his computer \naccess was monitored, and the government contractor to which he was assigned was \nasked to provide any relevant observations. At the year\u2019s conclusion, the committee \ndetermined that there was no longer a need for further observation of Applicant and the \nproposed debarment had also ended. Applicant continued, however, to report to the \nwitness. The witness has received favorable reports of Applicant\u2019s performance, and \nrated Applicant outstanding in his performance evaluations. He testified that Applicant \nhas complied with annual security and ethics trainings, and he considers Applicant \ntrustworthy, of good judgment, and capable of following rules and regulations. \nApplicant\u2019s FSO since 2010 described Applicant as an individual who follows security \nrules and procedures. His FSO also indicated that Applicant has completed his annual \nsecurity training requirements. 20 \n                                                     \n17 Tr. at 36-77, 90, 98, 104-105, 112-113; GE 1, 2, 4; AE C, G, I, N. \n \n18 Tr. at 17-35. \n \n19 Tr. at 17-35. \n \n20 Tr. at 17-35; AE A. \n\n \n7 \n \nRussia \n \n \nIn 2016, Russia continued to be a leading state intelligence threat to U.S. \ninterests. Its intelligence services target U.S. and allied personnel with access to \nsensitive computer network information. It is assuming a more assertive cyber posture \nbased on its willingness to target critical infrastructure systems and conduct espionage \noperations, even when detected and under increased public scrutiny. It has developed a \nground-launched cruise missile that the United States has declared is in violation of the \nIntermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty. \n \n \nRussia remains one of the top two most aggressive and capable collectors of \nsensitive U.S. economic information and technologies, particularly in cyberspace. Non-\ncyberspace collection methods include targeting of U.S. visitors overseas, especially if \nthe visitors are assessed as having access to sensitive information. Russia\u2019s highly \ncapable intelligence services are using human intelligence gathering, cyber, and other \noperations to collect economic information and technology to support its economic \ndevelopment and security. It continues to take information warfare to a new level, \nworking to fan anti-U.S. and anti-Western sentiment both within Russia and globally.  \n \n \nThe most significant human rights problems in Russia in 2015 involved \nrestrictions on the ability to choose one\u2019s government and freedoms of expression, \nassembly, association, and the media, as well as internet freedom; political \nprosecutions and administration of justice; and government discrimination against racial, \nethnic, religious, and sexual minorities. Other problems included allegations of torture \nand excessive force by law enforcement officials; executive branch pressure on the \njudiciary; electoral irregularities; and extensive official corruption. The government failed \nto take steps to prosecute or punish most officials who committed abuses. \n \n \nAlthough Russian law prohibits officials from entering a private residence except \nin cases prescribed by federal law or when authorized by a judicial decision, \ngovernment officials entered residences and premises without warrants. While Russian \nlaw also prohibits government monitoring of correspondence, telephone conversations, \nand other means of communication without a warrant, government officials engaged in \nelectronic surveillance without appropriate authorization.  \n \n \nIn October 2016, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and Office of \nthe Director of National Intelligence (ODNI) issued a Joint Statement on Election \nSecurity, stating that the U.S. intelligence community was confident that the Russian \ngovernment directed recent compromises of emails from U.S. persons and institutions, \nincluding from U.S. political organizations. In December 2016, the DHS, ODNI, and the \nFederal Bureau of Investigation released a Joint Analysis Report stating that activity by \nRussian intelligence services has been part of a decade-long campaign of cyber-\nenabled operations directed at the U.S. Government and its citizens. The campaign \nincluded spear phishing; targeting of government organizations, critical infrastructure, \nthink tanks, universities, political organizations, and corporations; theft of information \nfrom these organizations; and the recent public release of some of this stolen \ninformation.  \n\n \n8 \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.  \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nSection 7 of Exec. Or. 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms \nof the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also Exec. Or. 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple \nprerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n9 \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct  \n \nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the security concern for personal conduct:  \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes.  \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. I considered the following relevant: \n(c) credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is \nnot sufficient for an adverse determination under any other single \nguideline, but which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-\nperson \nassessment \nof \nquestionable \njudgment, \nuntrustworthiness, \nunreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and \nregulations, or other characteristics indicating that the individual may not \nproperly safeguard classified or sensitive information;  \n \n(d) credible adverse information that is not explicitly covered under any \nother guideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an adverse \ndetermination, but which, when combined with all available information, \nsupports a whole-person assessment of questionable judgment, \nuntrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply \nwith rules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that the \nindividual may not properly safeguard classified or sensitive information. \nThis includes, but is not limited to, consideration of: \n \n(1) untrustworthy or unreliable behavior to include breach of client \nconfidentiality, release of proprietary information, unauthorized \nrelease of sensitive corporate or government protected information; \n \n(2) any disruptive, violent, or other inappropriate behavior; \n \n(3) a pattern of dishonesty or rule violations; and \n \n(4) evidence of significant misuse of Government or other \nemployer's time or resources; and \n \n(e) personal conduct, or concealment of information about one\u2019s conduct, that \ncreates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress by a foreign \nintelligence entity or other individual or group. Such conduct includes: \n\n \n10 \n \n(1) engaging in activities which, if known, could affect the person\u2019s \npersonal, professional, or community standing. \n \nApplicant looked at pornography on his work computer from around February \n2014 through February 2015. He estimated at the hearing that he looked at \npornography at work an average of 15 to 30 minutes daily. He did not tell anyone at the \ntime that he was looking at pornography at work because he knew it was improper. \nWhile he denied that he ever mischarged to the government contract any time in which \nhe looked at pornography at work, the investigation conducted by the primary defense \ncontractor concluded that he had. The primary contractor paid $21,577 to the U.S. \nGovernment for Applicant\u2019s mischarged time and his then-employer had to repay the \nmoney to the primary contractor. He acknowledged during his July 2016 background \ninterview that the $20,000 was restitution for an established 100 hours of computer use \nduring work hours for personal purposes. Finally, the letter memorializing his meeting \nwith the debarment officials indicates that he accepted responsibility for mischarging a \ngovernment contract for misspent time. AG \u00b6\u00b6 16(c), 16(d), and 16(e) apply. \nI have considered all of the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 17 and considered \nthe following relevant:  \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; and \n \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, \nunreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely \nto recur. \n \nApplicant\u2019s conduct of viewing pornography on his work computer daily from \nFebruary 2014 through February 2015 was a serious offense. He immediately \nacknowledged his conduct once it was discovered through computer monitoring, and he \nthen immediately reported such conduct to his then-employer as well as his current \nemployer. He complied with all requirements imposed on him by his current employer \nand he has not had any other unfavorable issues. He attended SAA meetings, and he \ndisclosed his conduct and consequent termination to his wife.  \n \nApplicant has not, however, taken full responsibility for his conduct. Again, he \ndenied that he ever mischarged the government contract to which he was assigned for \ntime spent viewing pornographic material on his work computer. Yet, the investigation \nconducted by the primary defense contractor concluded that he had. Moreover, the \nletter memorializing his meeting with the debarment officials clearly states that he had \naccepted such responsibility. As such, his reliability, judgment, and trustworthiness \nremain questionable. I find that AG \u00b6\u00b6 17(c) and 17(d) are not established. \n \n\n \n11 \n \nGuideline M, Use of Information Technology \n \nAG \u00b6 39 expresses the security concern for use of information technology:  \n \nFailure to comply with rules, procedures, guidelines, or regulations \npertaining to information technology systems may raise security concerns \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, calling into question \nthe willingness or ability to properly protect sensitive systems, networks, \nand information. Information Technology includes any computer-based, \nmobile, or wireless device used to create, store, access, process, \nmanipulate, protect, or move information. This includes any component, \nwhether integrated into a larger system or not, such as hardware, \nsoftware, or firmware, used to enable or facilitate these operations. \nAG \u00b6 40 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. I considered the following relevant: \n(e) unauthorized use of any information technology system. \n \nApplicant looked at pornography on his work computer from around February \n2014 through February 2015. He did not tell anyone at the time that he was looking at \npornography at work because he knew it was improper. AG \u00b6 40(e) applies. \nI have considered all of the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 41 and considered \nthe following relevant:  \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur \nand does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or \ngood judgment. \n \nFor the same reasons set forth above in my Guideline E analysis, I find that AG \u00b6  \n41(a) is not established. \n \nGuideline B, Foreign Influence \n \nAG \u00b6 6 expresses the security concern for foreign influence:  \n \nForeign contacts and interests, including, but not limited to, business, \nfinancial, and property interests, are a national security concern if they \nresult in divided allegiance. They may also be a national security concern \nif they create circumstances in which the individual may be manipulated or \ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a \nway inconsistent with U.S. interests or otherwise made vulnerable to \npressure or coercion by any foreign interest. Assessment of foreign \ncontacts and interests should consider the country in which the foreign \ncontact or interest is located, including, but not limited to, considerations \n\n \n12 \n \nsuch as whether it is known to target U.S. citizens to obtain classified or \nsensitive information or is associated with a risk of terrorism. \nAG \u00b6 7 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. I considered the following relevant: \n(a) contact, regardless of method, with a foreign family member, business \nor professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or \nresident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of \nforeign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion;  \n \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual's obligation to \nprotect classified or sensitive information or technology and the \nindividual's desire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing \nthat information or technology; and \n \n(e) shared living quarters with a person or persons, regardless of \ncitizenship status, if that relationship creates a heightened risk of foreign \ninducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion. \n \nThe nature of a nation\u2019s government, its relationship with the United States, \nand its human rights record are relevant in assessing the likelihood that an applicant\u2019s \nfamily members are vulnerable to government coercion. The risk of coercion, \npersuasion, or duress is significantly greater if the foreign country has an \nauthoritarian government, a family member is associated with or dependent upon the \ngovernment, or the country is known to conduct intelligence operations against the \nUnited States. In considering the nature of the government, an administrative judge \nmust also consider any terrorist activity in the country at issue. See generally ISCR \nCase No. 02-26130 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 7, 2006) (reversing decision to grant \nclearance where administrative judge did not consider terrorist activity in area where \nfamily members resided). \n \nAG \u00b6 7(a) requires substantial evidence of a \u201cheightened risk.\u201d The \n\u201cheightened risk\u201d required to raise one of these disqualifying conditions is a relatively \nlow standard. \u201cHeightened risk\u201d denotes a risk greater than the normal risk inherent in \nhaving a family member living under a foreign government. \n \nApplicant\u2019s parents-in-law and brother-in-law are citizens and residents of \nRussia, and his father-in-law is a former officer in the Russian military. While Applicant \ntestified that his father-in-law is estranged from the family, his wife talks to her father \nseveral times yearly and she saw him in Russia so that he could meet his grandson. \nApplicant\u2019s wife is close to her mother and brother. She talks to them frequently. She \nvisits them in Russia once yearly, and she most recently traveled to Russia in 2018 for \nher brother\u2019s wedding.  \n \n\n \n13 \n \nRussia is one of the leading state intelligence threats to U.S. interests. It remains \none of the top two most aggressive and capable collectors of sensitive U.S. economic \ninformation and technologies, particularly in cyberspace. Non-cyberspace collection \nmethods include targeting of U.S. visitors overseas, especially if the visitors are \nassessed as having access to sensitive information. It continues to take information \nwarfare to a new level, working to fan anti-U.S. and anti-Western sentiment both within \nRussia and globally. Russian government officials enter private residences and premises \nwithout warrants, and engage in electronic surveillance without appropriate authorization. \nApplicant\u2019s in-laws in Russia create a heightened risk of foreign exploitation, \ninducement, manipulation, pressure, and coercion. AG \u00b6\u00b6 7(a), 7(b), and 7(e) apply. \nI have considered all of the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 8 and considered \nthe following relevant:  \n(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in \nwhich these persons are located, or the positions or activities of those \npersons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be \nplaced in a position of having to choose between the interests of a foreign \nindividual, group, organization, or government and the interests of the \nUnited States; \n \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of \nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, or allegiance to the group, \ngovernment, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such deep and \nlongstanding relationships and loyalties in the United States, that the \nindividual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the \nU.S. interest; and \n \n(c) contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and \ninfrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign \ninfluence or exploitation. \n  \nApplicant\u2019s parents-in-law and brother-in-law are Russian citizens residing in \nRussia. Accordingly, AG \u00b6 8(a) is not established for the reasons set out in the \nabove discussion of AG \u00b6\u00b6 7(a), 7(b), and 7(e). Applicant\u2019s wife maintains regular \ncontact with her family in Russia. She also travels to Russia once yearly to visit them. \nAG \u00b6 8(c) is not established. \n \nApplicant is a native-born U.S. citizen residing in the United States. He served \nhonorably in the U.S. military from 1990 to 1994. His wife became a naturalized U.S. \ncitizen in 2014 and renounced her Russian citizenship in 2016. Their children are \nnative-born U.S. citizens. Though Applicant received $90,000 in 2013 from the sale of \nhis mother-in-law\u2019s condominium in Russia, neither he nor his wife have received or \nexpect to receive any additional money from anyone in Russia. Applicant has \nsubstantial financial interests in the United States and neither he nor his wife have any \nsuch interests in Russia. He has complied with security requirements and reported his \nforeign travels and receipt of money from his mother-in-law to his FSO. These are all \n\n \n14 \n \nfactors that weigh in Applicant\u2019s favor. However, his ties to his family in Russia through \nhis wife are also as strong. As such, Applicant has not met his burden of \ndemonstrating that he would resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the U.S. interest. \nAG \u00b6 8(b) is not established. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the \npotentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and \ncircumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuidelines E, M, and B in my whole-person analysis.  \n \nI assessed Applicant\u2019s credibility at the hearing. He has not taken responsibility \nfor mischarging a government contract for time spent viewing pornographic material at \nwork. As such, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude Applicant did not \nmitigate the personal conduct, use of information technology, and foreign influence \nsecurity concerns. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline E:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a - 1.b:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline M:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n\n \n15 \n \nParagraph 3, Guideline B:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 3.a - 3.c:  \n \n \nAgainst APPLICANT \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security \nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n \n________________________ \nCandace Le\u2019i Garcia \nAdministrative Judge \n",

Applicant mitigated the \npersonal conduct concerns, but the financial considerations concerns remain. Applicant \nfailed to timely file his federal and state income tax returns and timely pay his income \ntaxes, as required, for seven of the last eight years. He also failed to resolve his \ndelinquent accounts. Applicant\u2019s request for access to classified information is denied.  \nStatement of the Case \nOn July 21, 2017, the DOD issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing \nsecurity concerns under the financial considerations guideline.1 DOD adjudicators were \nunable to find that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant\u2019s \nsecurity clearance and recommended that the case be submitted to a Defense Office of \nHearings and Appeals (DOHA) administrative judge for a determination whether to deny \nhis security clearance.  \n1 The DOD acted under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry, \nsigned by President Eisenhower on February 20, 1960, as amended; as well as DOD Directive 5220.6, \nDefense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program, dated January 2, 1992, as amended \n(Directive), and the Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information, \nimplemented on June 8, 2017.   \n12/28/2018\n\n \n2 \n \nApplicant timely answered the SOR and requested a hearing. At the hearing, \nconvened on September 10, 2018, I admitted Government\u2019s Exhibits (GE) 1 through 18 \nand Applicant\u2019s Exhibits (AE) A through E, without objection. After the hearing, \nApplicant timely offered AE F through K, which are also admitted without objection. \nDOHA received the transcript (Tr.) on September 19, 2018.   \n \nProcedural Matters \n \n \nAt the beginning of the hearing, Applicant indicated that he did not remember \nreceiving the October 2017 letter Department Counsel sent to him containing the \ndocuments the Government planned to use in its case against him. Applicant confirmed \nthat the letter and the attached documents were sent to the correct address. Before the \nhearing started, I offered Applicant the opportunity to review the letter and the \nGovernment\u2019s proposed exhibits. After doing so, Applicant confirmed he wanted to \nproceed with the hearing as scheduled.2  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant, 45, has worked as a security guard with several different federal \ncontracting companies since October 2013. He has worked for his current employer, \nearning approximately $60,000 annually, since December 2014. He completed a \nsecurity clearance application, his first, in March 2015, disclosing a 2012 conviction for \ndriving under the influence of alcohol. The ensuing investigation revealed a more \nextensive criminal record. The investigation also revealed that Applicant failed to file \nfederal and state tax returns for a number of years between 2010 and 2015, and that \nApplicant owes $7,000 on 12 delinquent accounts.3  \n \n \nThe SOR alleges Applicant\u2019s criminal history under the personal conduct \nguideline. Applicant\u2019s first arrest for unlawful use of a vehicle, occurred in 1990 (SOR \u00b6 \n1.a). He was among a group of people participating in a carpool. Neither he nor the \nother passengers were aware that the driver did not have permission to use the car. He \nwas released without being charged. He was arrested again in 1992 for felony assault \non a police officer (SOR \u00b6 1.b). Applicant testified that he and his friends intervened in a \ndomestic dispute they witnessed on a public basketball court. When the police arrived, \nApplicant was one of several people arrested. He denies assaulting a police officer. The \ncharges were dismissed.  In 2011, Applicant was charged with domestic violence after \nan incident involving his son, who was 20 at the time (SOR \u00b6 1.e). The young man was \nintoxicated and started hitting his 18-year-old sister. Applicant intervened. Although he \nwas arrested, Applicant testified that he was released without charges. Applicant was \ncharged in March 2013 for driving with a suspended license (SOR \u00b6 1.i) and in \nNovember 2013 for driving on a revoked license (SOR \u00b6 1.j). Applicant testified that he \n                                                          \n2 Tr. 5-6; HE I. \n \n3 Tr. 42-45; GE 1-3, 5-16. \n \n\n \n3 \n \nwas unaware of the status of his license in March 2013 and that the November 2013 \nincident was the result of an administrative mistake. Both charges were nolle prossed.4  \n \nApplicant admits being arrested multiple times for alcohol-related incidents. He \nwas arrested in 1996 and 1998 for DUI (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c \u2013 d). The dispositions of these \ncharges is not in the record. In 2009 and 2012, Applicant was charged with driving while \nimpaired by alcohol (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.f and 1.h) He was convicted both times. He received \nprobation before judgment for the 2009 incident and served seven days in jail for the \n2012 incident. At hearing, Applicant admitted that he had an alcohol problem. However, \nhe realized that his alcohol consumption habits were incompatible with his work as a \nsecurity officer. He has abstained from alcohol since 2014.5  \n \nThe SOR also alleges a series of financial issues, specifically that Applicant \nfailed to file his federal and state income tax returns for 2010 through 2015 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a \nand 1.b).  However, based on wage and income transcripts in the record for 2010 \nthrough 2012, Applicant was not required to file federal or state income tax returns for \n2012. Although he testified that his 2013 income did not meet the minimum filing \nrequirement, he did not provide any corroborating documentation. Applicant explained \nthat he failed to file his federal and state income tax returns because \u201ctime got away \nfrom him.\u201d  He filed his 2011, 2014 and 2015 federal income tax returns in September \n2017, but did not pay the additional taxes owed. He testified that his outstanding state \nincome tax returns were prepared, but he did not know if they had been filed. At hearing \nhe admitted that he also failed to file his 2016 and 2017 federal and state income tax \nreturns.6 \n \nBelieving he owed outstanding federal taxes, Applicant testified that he intended \nto hire a law firm to help him negotiate with the IRS to pay a reduced amount. However, \nin his post-hearing submissions, he provided an installment agreement with the IRS \nfiled in October 2018 to pay $11,048 in outstanding federal taxes for the 2011 and the  \n2014 through 2017 tax years. The installment plan, which requires $400 monthly \ninstallment, begins in December 2018. Applicant did not provide any additional \ninformation about the status of his outstanding state income tax returns. Applicant is \nalso in debt to the state for $1,064 (SOR \u00b6 2.c) for an outstanding judgment. He claims \nthe judgment had been paid, but did not provide any corroborating documentation.7 \n \nIn addition to his outstanding income tax obligations, the SOR also alleges that \nApplicant owes $7,000 for 12 delinquent accounts (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.d through 2.n). Applicant \nadmits that he owes the accounts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.d through 2.i. In his answer, he \nclaimed that the debts were consolidated with a debt repayment program. At the \nhearing, Applicant testified that he signed up for the program, but did not execute a \n                                                          \n4 Tr. 24-29; GE 3, 5, 8-9. \n \n5 Tr. 24-25, 30-32; GE 6-7.  \n \n6 Tr. 32-39, 46; Answer; AE A-E. \n \n7 Tr. 33, 39-40, 47; GE 10; AE G-H. \n\n \n4 \n \nrepayment plan. He provided documentation that he has made arrangements to resolve \nSOR \u00b6 1.e, the deficiency balance on an automobile loan. He plans to work additional \nhours to pay the $1,226 debt. Applicant denies owing the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.j \nthrough 1.n as he is not familiar with the accounts. He believes that the debts may be \nattributed to identify theft. He did not provide any documentation to establish that he \nfiled an identity theft complaint or that he challenged the debts in question with the \ncredit reporting agencies. The alleged delinquent accounts remain unresolved.8 \n \nCurrently, Applicant provides the only source of income for his household, which \nincludes his partner and their four children, ages 27, 25, 21, and 15. After paying his \nrecurring bills, Applicant has approximately $200 in disposable income each month. He \nhopes his partner, who has been unemployed since April 2018, is able to secure \nemployment in the near future.9  \n  \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record.  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.  \n \n                                                          \n8 Tr. 40-42, 48-49; GE 2, 11-16; AE I-J. \n \n9 Tr. 45-52. \n\n \n5 \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \n \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions about an \nindividual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified information. The \nSOR alleges Applicant\u2019s criminal history, 10 charges, including 2 convictions, between \n1990 and 2012. This adverse information raises concerns under the criminal conduct \nand alcohol consumption guidelines, but given the passage of time, the alleged \nincidents are insufficient for an adverse determination under either rubric. However, \nwhen considered as a whole, the incidents support a whole-person assessment of \nquestionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to \ncomply with relies and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that the individual \nmay not properly safeguard classified or sensitive information.10 However, the record \ncontains sufficient evidence to mitigate the personal conduct concerns.  \n \n \nOf the 10 alleged arrests, 5 are minor incidents (1.a, 1.b, 1.g, 1.i, 1.j) that do not \nreflect negatively on Applicant\u2019s security worthiness.11 While he was involved in the \nincidents alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b, and 1.g, he was not the instigator or primary actor. \nWhile the traffic violations alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.i and 1.j could suggest a disregard for \nthe laws, rules, and regulations, it appears that SOR 1.i was unintentional and \u00b6 1.j was \nthe result of an administrative snafu. However, the remaining five incidents, SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c \n- 1.f, and 1.h, all involving driving under the influence of alcohol, raise concerns about \nApplicant\u2019s alcohol consumption and its impact on his judgment. His multiple instances \nof driving under the influence of alcohol also shows a disregard for laws, rules, and \nregulations. However, these incidents are mitigated by the passage of time.12 \n                                                          \n10 AG \u00b6 16(c). \n \n11 AG \u00b6 17(c). \n \n12 AG \u00b6 17(d).  \n\n \n6 \n \nApplicant\u2019s last alcohol-related incident occurred over six years ago. Since then, he has \nacknowledged his alcohol problem and recognized his behavior was incompatible with \nhis professional responsibilities and duties. He has abstained from alcohol for four \nyears, making recurrence of similar criminal conduct unlikely.13 \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nFailure to meet one\u2019s financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of \njudgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified \nor sensitive information.14 The SOR alleges Applicant\u2019s failure to file his federal and \nstate income tax returns for 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014, and 2015 and that he has \napproximately $7,000 in unresolved delinquent debts. The record is sufficient to \nestablish the Government\u2019s prima facie case that Applicant has a history of not meeting \nhis financial obligations, and that he has failed to timely file his federal and state income \nreturns, as required.15   \n \nApplicant\u2019s failure to file was caused by his own negligence and remains an \nongoing problem. He failed to produce evidence that his outstanding federal and state \nincome returns have been filed. His post-hearing efforts to establish an installment \nagreement with the IRS is not sufficient to establish that his tax problems are remedied \nor under control. Applicant also failed to establish a record of debt repayment or that he \nhas filed disputes with the credit reporting agencies to challenge the accounts he \nbelieves are the result of identity theft. The delinquent debts alleged in the SOR remain \nunresolved and he does not have a plan to resolve them.  \n \nBased on the record, doubts remain about Applicant\u2019s ongoing suitability for \naccess to classified information. In reaching this conclusion, I have also considered the \nwhole-person factors at AG \u00b6 2(d). Applicant takes his position as a security guard \nseriously and his role has helped him mature and grow into a more responsible adult. \nHowever, he has not done enough to establish financial rehabilitation.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                          \n13 AG \u00b6 17(d). \n \n14 AG \u00b6 18. \n \n15 AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(c) and (f).  \n  \n\n \n7 \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Personal Conduct:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.j:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \nParagraph 2, Financial Considerations:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \nSubparagraphs 2.a \u2013 2.n:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented, it is not clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant Applicant a security clearance.

Eligibility\nfor access to classified information is denied.\nStatement of Case\nOn December 21, 2016, the Department of Defense (DOD) Consolidated\nAdjudications Facility (CAF) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing reasons\nwhy DOD adjudicators could not make the affirmative determination of eligibility for a\nsecurity clearance, and recommended referral to an administrative judge to determine\nwhether a security clearance should be granted, denied, or revoked. The action was\ntaken under Executive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information\nWithin Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense\nIndustrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as\namended (Directive); and the Adjudicative Guidelines (AGs) implemented by the DOD\non September 1, 2006. \n01/17/2019\n\nThe Director of National Intelligence, by Security Executive Agent, Directive 4,\nApp. A, National security Adjudicative Guidelines (SEAD 4), dated December 10, 2016,\nsuperceded and replaced the September 2006 adjudicative guidelines (AGs).  They apply\nto all covered individuals who require initial or continued eligibility for access to classified\ninformation or eligibility to hold a sensitive position. Procedures for administrative due\nprocess for contractor personnel continue to be governed by DOD Directive 5220.6,\nsubject to the updated substantive changes in the AGs, effective June 8, 2017.\nApplication of the AGs that were in effect when the SOR was issued would not affect my\ndecision in this case.\nApplicant responded to the SOR on January 23, 2018, and requested a hearing. \nThe case was assigned to me on May 20, 2018, and scheduled for hearing on June 6,\n2018. The Government\u2019s case consisted of four exhibits  (GEs 1-4) that were admitted\nwithout objection. Applicant relied on one witness (himself) and three exhibits that were\nadmitted without objection as AEs A-C. The transcript was received on June 14, 2018.\nProcedural Issues\nBefore the close of the hearing, Applicant requested the record be kept open to\npermit him the opportunity to supplement the record with documented installment\nagreements with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and resident state taxing authority,\ntogether with federal and state transcripts for tax years 1999-2015. \nFor good cause shown, Applicant was granted 30 days to supplement the record.\nDepartment Counsel was afforded seven days to respond. Applicant did not supplement\nthe record. \nSummary of Pleadings\nUnder Guideline F, Applicant allegedly (a) is indebted on a judgment filed against\nhim in August 2016 in the approximate amount of $2,401; (b) is indebted to the IRS for a\ntax lien entered against him in May 2011 for $453,709; (c) is indebted to his state of\nresidence for a tax lien entered against him in November 2010 in the approximate amount\nof $7,724; (d) is indebted to his state of residence for a tax lien entered against him in\nJune 2007 in the approximate amount of $27,238; (e) is indebted to his state of residence\nfor a tax lien entered against him in May 2007 in the approximate amount of $12,453; (f)\nin indebted to a consumer creditor for an amount placed in collection in the approximate\namount of $1,943; (g) failed to file his federal tax returns for tax years 1999 through 2015;\nand (h) failed to file his state tax returns for tax years 1999 through 2015.\nIn his response to the SOR, Applicant denied all of the allegations in the SOR. He\nclaimed no knowledge of the judgment covered by SOR \u00b6 1.a. He claimed he engaged\ncounsel and a certified public accountant (CPA) to prepare his tax returns, file them, and\nto negotiate a payment plan to repay any unpaid taxes.  And he claimed no knowledge of\nthe alleged delinquent debt covered by SOR \u00b6 1.f.\n.\n2\n\nFinding   s   of Fact\nApplicant is a 54-year-old project coordinator for a defense contractor who seeks a\nsecurity clearance. The allegations covered in the SOR were not admitted by Applicant\nand are reserved for fact-finding based on the developed evidence at hearing. \nBackground\nApplicant married in April 1988 and has three children from this marriage. H\nearned a high school diploma in May 2003, but did not report any post-high school\neducation credits. (GE 1) Applicant reported no military service.\nSince August 2015, Applicant has been employed by his current defense\ncontractor. (GEs 1-2) Between January 1994 and August 2010, he was self-employed.\nAnd between August 2010 and August 2015, he was employed by various non-DOD\ncontractors in various job assignments, interspersed with periods of unemployment. (GEs\n1-2)\nApplicant\u2019s finances\nBetween 1999 and 2015, Applicant failed to file his federal and state of residence\nincome tax returns, as required by law. (GEs 1-2) He attributed his filing failures to\nnational disasters, filing delays by his lawyers, poor cash flow from his self-employed\nbusiness, and caring for a relative stricken with cancer. (Tr. 23-27, 69) While he claims to\nhave filed his federal and state returns for tax years 1999-2015 in 2017 (AE C; Tr. 36), he\nprovided no independent corroboration and substantiation of his filing claims, despite\nafforded post-hearing opportunities to do so.\nFor years 1999-2015, Applicant accrued delinquent federal and state taxes.\nAccrued federal taxes for these years are covered by a federal tax lien filed in May 2011\nfor $453,709. (GEs 2-4 and AE C; Tr. 37-38) While Applicant claims to have resolved this\ntax lien through a combination of payments and refunds, to date, he has provided no\ndocumentation to verify his claims, and it remains unresolved and outstanding. (AE C; Tr.\n36)  Credit reports also document state tax liens entered against Applicant in November\n2010 for $7,724 and in May 2007 for $12,453. (GEs 2-4 and AE C; Tr. 19, 22)\nBesides his tax debts, credit reports document Applicant\u2019s accruing a judgment\nagainst him in August 2016 for $2,401, as well as a delinquent insurance debt in the\namount of $1,943. (GEs 2-4) To date, these no-tax debts remain unresolved and\noutstanding. \nIn an effort to address his delinquent tax and consumer debts, Applicant petitioned\nfor Chapter 13 bankruptcy relief in March 2018. (AEs A-C) In his petition, he listed assets\nof $91,801 and liabilities of $584,835. (AE C; Tr. 40) He listed several claims in his\npetition as follows: a priority unsecured IRS tax lien of $453,709 filed in May 2011 and an\nunsecured priority vendor\u2019s lien of $175,000 filed in March 2015. (AE C) Applicant listed\n3\n\nunsecured non-priority state tax liens in his petition totaling $10,125. (AE C; Tr. 40) He \nlisted unsecured non-priority state tax liens in his petition totaling $10,125, an aggregate\nof tax liens at odds with the $47,415 figure reported in his credit reports. (AE C)\nConceivably, the lower figure represents a reduction of state taxes owed due to payments\nmade and refund offsets. (AE C; Tr. 22) Without state tax transcripts or other reliable data\nsummaries to track his payments and credits, no reliable inferences can be drawn as to\nthe state of his account balance with this state.\nIn April 2018, the presiding bankruptcy court in Applicant\u2019s state of residence,\nconfirmed Applicant\u2019s Chapter 13 plan. (AE A; Tr. 42) Under the terms of Applicant\u2019s plan,\nthe court imposed payment conditions of $2,396 monthly payments to the trustee for the\nremaining term of the plan. (AE A) Scheduled monthly payments were to commence 30\ndays from the date of Applicant\u2019s March 2018 petition filing and continue for the duration\nof the plan. (AEs A-C) Payment allocations were set as follows: $1,250 to the vendor lien\nholder; $300 to the IRS; and $1,026 to the tax lien holder of Applicant\u2019s state of\nresidence. (AEs A-C)\nWhether Applicant has maintained compliance with his Chapter 13 payment terms\nis unclear, for he has not provided any payment documentation, either at hearing, or\nduring the time reserved for post-hearing updates. (AEs A-C; Tr. 43, 58-60) Further, his\nclaims of additional payments to the IRS on its $453,709 tax lien, in addition to his\npayments to the chapter 13 trustee, are neither corroborated nor substantiated. (Tr. 39-\n40, 49-50)\nTo date, Applicant has not provided any federal or state transcripts to verify his tax\nfilings, dates thereof, and evidence of any past payments made (voluntarily or\ninvoluntarily) for tax years 1999-2015.  Because Applicant has not provided any federal or\nstate tax transcripts, tax returns, or payment history for tax years 1999-2015, his filing and\npayment claims cannot be validated. And, without IRS and state taxing  agency approvals\nof his tax filings and payment plans, his Chapter 13 payment plan cannot be determined\nto meet federal and state filing and payment requirements for Chapter 13 discharge.\nCurrently, Applicant nets $5,633 a month on average; while his wife nets\napproximately $2,730 a month. (AE C; Tr. 43-45) Payroll deductions total $4,088 for\nhimself and $1,985 for his wife. (AE C) Reported monthly expenses are $3,466 for both of\nthem. (AE C) \nApplicant reported a monthly remainder of $2,607. (AE C; Tr. 45-46).  He has an\nIRA retirement account with approximately $12,000 in the account. (Tr. 47) He reported\nexempt property of $18,000. (AE C)\n. \nPolicies\n                \n       The SEAD 4, App. A lists guidelines to be used by administrative judges in the\ndecision-making process covering security clearance cases. These guidelines take into\naccount factors that could create a potential conflict of interest for the individual applicant,\n4\n\nas well as considerations that could affect the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and\nability to protect classified information. These guidelines include conditions that could\nraise a security concern and may be disqualifying (disqualifying conditions), if any, and\nmany of the conditions that could mitigate security concerns.\nThese guidelines must be considered before deciding whether or not a security\nclearance should be granted, continued, or denied. The guidelines do not require\nadministrative judges to place exclusive reliance on the enumerated disqualifying and\nmitigating conditions in the guidelines in arriving at a decision. Each of the guidelines is to\nbe evaluated in the context of the whole person in accordance with App. A. AG \u00b6 2(c).\nIn addition to the relevant AGs, administrative judges must take into account the\npertinent considerations for assessing extenuation and mitigation set forth in App. A, AG\n\u00b6 2(d) of the AGs, which are intended to assist the judges in reaching a fair and impartial\ncommonsense decision based upon a careful consideration of the pertinent guidelines\nwithin the context of the whole person. \nThe adjudicative process is designed to examine a sufficient period of an\napplicant\u2019s life to enable predictive judgments to be made about whether the applicant is\nan acceptable security risk. The following App A, AG \u00b6 2(d) factors are pertinent: (1) the\nnature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the\nconduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the\nconduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other\npermanent behavioral chances; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for\npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or\nrecurrence.\n Viewing the issues raised and evidence as a whole, the following individual\nguidelines are pertinent in this case:\nFinancial Considerations\n       The Concern: Failure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy\ndebts and meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of\njudgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which\ncan raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and\nability to protect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can\nalso be caused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of,\nother issues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling,\nmental health conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse of\ndependence. An individual who is financially overextended is at greater\nrisk of having to engage in illegal acts or otherwise questionable acts to\ngenerate funds. . . .  AG \u00b6 18.\n5\n\nBurden of Proof\nBy virtue of the principles and policies framed by the AGs, a decision to grant or\ncontinue an applicant's security clearance may be made only upon a threshold finding\nthat to do so is clearly consistent with the national interest.  Because the Directive\nrequires administrative judges to make a commonsense appraisal of the evidence\naccumulated in the record, the ultimate determination of an applicant's eligibility for a\nsecurity clearance depends, in large part, on the relevance and materiality of that\nevidence. See United States, v. Gaudin, 515 U.S. 506, 509-511 (1995).  \nAs with all adversarial proceedings, the judge may draw only those inferences\nwhich have a reasonable and logical basis from the evidence of record.  Conversely, the\njudge cannot draw factual inferences that are grounded on speculation or conjecture.\nThe Government's initial burden is twofold: (1) it must prove by substantial\nevidence any controverted facts alleged in the SOR, and (2) it must demonstrate that\nthe facts proven have a material bearing to the applicant's eligibility to obtain or maintain\na security clearance. The required materiality showing, however, does not require the\nGovernment to affirmatively demonstrate that the applicant has actually mishandled or\nabused classified information before it can deny or revoke a security clearance. Rather,\nthe judge must consider and weigh the cognizable risks that an applicant may\ndeliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information.\nOnce the Government meets its initial burden of proof of establishing admitted or\ncontroverted facts, the evidentiary burden shifts to the applicant for the purpose of\nestablishing his or her security worthiness through evidence of refutation, extenuation,\nor mitigation.  Based on the requirement of  Exec. Or. 10865 that all security clearances\nbe clearly consistent with the national interest, the applicant has the ultimate burden of\ndemonstrating his or her clearance eligibility. \u201c[S]ecurity-clearance determinations\nshould err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d See Department of the Navy v. Egan,\n484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988). \nAnalysis  \nSecurity concerns are raised over Applicant\u2019s failure to timely file his federal and\nstate tax returns for tax years 1999-2015, accrual of federal and state tax liens covering\ndelinquent taxes exceeding $500,000, and two delinquent non-tax debts (a judgment\nentered in August 2016 for $2,401) and an insurance debts for $1,943). These concerns\nover tax filing and debt delinquencies raise questions about Applicant\u2019s judgment and\nreliability to safely and prudently manage his finances. \nFinancial Concerns\n      Applicant\u2019s failure to timely file federal and state income tax returns for multiple\nyears (1999-2015) and his incurring of delinquent federal and state tax liens and non-\n6\n\ntax debts for the years at issue warrant the application of four disqualifying conditions\n(DC) of the Guidelines: DC \u00b6\u00b6 19(a), \u201cinability to satisfy debts\u201d; 19(b); unwillingness to\nsatisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so\u201d; 19(c), \u201ca history of not meeting financial\nobligations\u201d; and 19(f), \u201cfailure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local\nincome tax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as\nrequired.\u201d\nFinancial stability in a person cleared to protect classified information is required\nprecisely to inspire trust and confidence in the holder of a security clearance that\nentitles him to access classified information. While the principal concern of a security\nclearance holder\u2019s demonstrated financial difficulties is vulnerability to coercion and\ninfluence, judgment and trust concerns are implicit in cases involving debt\ndelinquencies.  \nHistorically, the timing of filing federal tax returns and resolving federal and state\ntax delinquencies are critical to an assessment of an applicant\u2019s trustworthiness,\nreliability, and good judgment in following rules and guidelines necessary for those\nseeking access to classified information or to holding a sensitive position. See ISCR\nCase No. 14-06808 at 3 (App. Bd. Nov. 23, 2016); ISCR Case No. 14-01894 at 5 (App.\nBd. Aug. 18, 2015). Applicant\u2019s cited extenuating circumstances (i.e., national disasters,\npoor cash flow, caring for a relative with diagnosed cancer, and lawyer delays) and\ninsufficient income to pay his accrued federal and state taxes and other non-tax debts\nwhen due and payable. His claims without more probative evidence to corroborate and\nsubstantiate them are not enough to credit him with justifiable extenuation and \nmitigation.  \nTo date, Applicant has provided no persuasive justification for his failure to timely\nfile his federal and state tax returns, address his federal and state taxes due for the tax\nyears 1999-2015, and provide evidence of his addressing his reported judgment and\ninsurance debts with documented payments and payment plans.  Based on Applicant\u2019s \ncited circumstances, Applicant\u2019s failure or inability to corroborate and substantiate his \ntax filing and payment claims and demonstrate a good track record of compliance with\nthe terms of his Chapter 13 petition and any payment arrangements he may have with\nthe IRS and state taxing agency of his state and non-tax creditors listed in the SOR\npreclude him from fully availing himself of the benefits of either MC \u00b6 20(b), \u201cthe\nconditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s\ncontrol (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical\nemergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the individual acted responsibly\nunder the circumstances\u201d: MC  \u00b6 20(d), \u201cthe individual initiated and is adhering to a\ngood-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts\u201d; or MC  \u00b6 20(c)\n\u201cthe individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the problem from a\nlegitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit counseling service, and there are\nclear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control.\u201d See ISCR Case\nNo. 15-06440 at 3-5 (App. Bd. Dec. 26, 2017); ISCR Case No. 05-11366 at 4 n.9 (App.\nBd. Jan. 12, 2007) (citing ISCR Case No. 99-0462 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 29, 2005). \n7\n\nAnd, because Applicant\u2019s tax filing and debt issues continue to be considered\nrecent for so long as they remain unresolved, he may not avail himself of the mitigating\nbenefits of MC \u00b6 20(a), \u201cthe behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or\noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt\non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.\u201d See ISCR\nCase No. 15\u201306532 at 3( App. Bd. Feb. 16, 2017)(citing ISCR Case No. 15-01690 at 2\n(App. Bd. Sept. 13, 2016). \nWhether Applicant is entitled to the full mitigating benefits of MC \u00b6 20(g), \u201cthe\nindividual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority to file or pay the\namount owed and is in compliance with those arrangements,\u201d is unclear at this point.\nSee ISCR Case No. 16-02246, at 2 (App. Bd. Dec. 8, 2017). Applicant provided no\ndocumentation at hearing or in permitted post-hearing submissions of any completed\ninstallment agreements with the IRS and state taxing agency, much less evidence of\ncompliance with those agreements.\nIn evaluating Guideline F cases, the Appeal Board has stressed the importance\nof a \u201cmeaningful track record\u201d that includes evidence of actual debt reduction through\nvoluntary payment of debts, and implicitly where applicable the timely filing of tax\nreturns. ISCR Case No. 07-06482 at 2-3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008) And, in a consistent\nline of decisions, the Appeal Board has questioned the value of bankruptcy petitions\ninitiated after the issuance of an SOR to demonstrate restored financial responsibility\nand sound judgment. See ADP Case No. 17-00263 at 4 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 1918 (citing\nISCR Case No. 15-00682 at 3 (App. Bd. July 13, 2016)).\nIn Applicant\u2019s case, his failure or inability to provide documentary proof of his\nfiling federal and state income tax returns for tax years 1999-2015, addressing his owed\nfederal and state taxes, and paying or otherwise resolving his two delinquent non-tax-\nrelated debts of record before the initiation of the security clearance process precludes\nhim from meeting his evidentiary burden with respect to raised security concerns about\nthe condition of his finances. More effort and results could be reasonably expected of\nApplicant in taking the necessary steps to restore his finances to stable levels\nconsistent with eligibility criteria for holding a security clearance.\nWhole-Person Assessment\nWhole-person assessment is unfavorable to Applicant. He has shown insufficient \nprogress to date in filing his federal and state income tax returns over a period of\nmultiple years and addressing his delinquent federal and state tax liens and non-tax\ndebts. While Applicant\u2019s general contributions to the U.S. defense effort through his\ncurrent employer are recognized and merit respect and appreciation, his credits are\ninsufficient o surmount historical trust and judgment issues associated with his failure to\ntimely file his federal and state income tax returns over the course of many years  and\nfailure to better address his major tax and non-tax delinquencies.\nOverall, Applicant\u2019s actions to date in addressing his finances reflect too little\nevidence of restored financial responsibility and judgment to overcome reasonable\n8\n\ndoubts about his trustworthiness, reliability, and ability to protect classified information\nor occupy a sensitive position. See AG \u00b6 18. Conclusions are warranted that his\nfinances are insufficiently stabilized at this time to meet minimum eligibility requirements\nfor holding a security clearance.  Unfavorable conclusions are entered with respect to\nthe allegations covered by SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.h. Eligibility to hold a security clearance under\nthe facts and circumstances of this case is inconsistent with the national interest.\nFormal Findings\nIn reviewing the allegations of the SOR and ensuing conclusions reached in the\ncontext of the findings of fact, conclusions, conditions, and the factors listed above, I\nmake the following formal findings:\nGUIDELINE F (FINANCIAL CONSIDERATIONS): AGAINST APPLICANT\n   \n             Subparagraphs 1.a-1.h:                          Against Applicant\n \nConclusions\nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility to\nhold a security clearance.

Edmunds, Esq. \n03/12/2019 \n \n______________ \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \n \nMATCHINSKI, Elizabeth M., Administrative Judge: \n \n \nApplicant was indicted by a grand jury in May 2013 on 12 counts of sexual criminal \nconduct allegedly committed against his underage stepdaughter between July 2009 and \nFebruary 2013, including four counts of aggravated rape of a child. Applicant denied any \nculpability, and in March 2015, the state declined further prosecution. There is reliable \nevidence that Applicant committed sex crimes. His failure to timely report his arrest to his \nemployer also raises significant concerns about his judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness. Clearance is denied. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \n \nOn June 8, 2018, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications Facility \n(DOD CAF) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant, detailing security concerns \nunder Guideline J (criminal conduct), Guideline E (personal conduct), and Guideline D \n(sexual behavior). The SOR explained why the DOD CAF was unable to find it clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue security clearance eligibility for \nhim. The DOD CAF took the action under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n\n2 \n \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the National Security Adjudicative Guidelines for \nDetermining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information or Eligibility to Hold a Sensitive \nPosition (AG) effective within the DOD on June 8, 2017. \n \nApplicant responded to the SOR through his counsel on July 27, 2018, and \nrequested a hearing before an administrative judge from the Defense Office of Hearings \nand Appeals (DOHA). On January 9, 2019, the case was assigned to me to conduct a \nhearing to determine whether it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or \ncontinue a security clearance for Applicant. On January 15, 2019, I scheduled a hearing for \nFebruary 12, 2019.  \n \nAt the hearing, six Government exhibits (GEs 1-6) were admitted in evidence. An \nAugust 13, 2018 letter forwarding discovery of the GEs to Applicant\u2019s counsel and a list of \nthe GEs were marked as hearing exhibits (HEs I-II) but not admitted as evidentiary exhibits. \nFive Applicant exhibits (AEs A-E) were admitted in evidence, and Applicant testified, as \nreflected in a transcript (Tr.) received on February 27, 2019. \n \nI held the record open for two weeks after the hearing for Applicant to present a \ndeclaration from the attorney who represented him in defense of the felony charges. On \nFebruary 14, 2019, Applicant submitted a declaration (AE F), which was accepted into \nevidence without any objection. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nThe SOR alleges under Guideline J (SOR \u00b6 1.a-1.b) and cross alleges under \nGuideline E (SOR \u00b6 2.d) and Guideline D (SOR \u00b6 3.a) that Applicant was arrested on \nFebruary 23, 2013, on three counts of rape of a child and one count of witness intimidation \nand that he was indicted on May 29, 2013, on four counts of aggravated rape of a child, six \ncounts of indecent assault and battery on a child under age 14, one count of assault and \nbattery with intent to rape, and one count of assault and battery by means of a dangerous \nweapon. Under Guideline E, Applicant is also alleged to have failed to timely report his \narrest to his facility security officer (FSO) (SOR \u00b6 2.a) and to have lied on his May 7, 2015 \nQuestionnaire for National Security Positions (SF 86) (SOR \u00b6 2.b) and during his July 12, \n2015 subject interview with a government investigator (SOR \u00b6 2.c) by stating that he was \nfalsely accused of the criminal conduct allegations. \n \n \nAfter considering the pleadings, exhibits, and transcript, I find that Applicant\u2019s arrest \nin SOR \u00b6 1.a is related to the charges in SOR \u00b6 1.b and does not represent an allegation of \nadditional criminal conduct. Additional findings of fact follow. \n \nApplicant is a 40-year-old senior test engineer with a bachelor\u2019s degree in electrical \nengineering awarded in May 2005. He has worked for his current employer, a defense \ncontractor, since May 2004, and was granted a DOD secret clearance in June 2005. His \nsecurity clearance eligibility was suspended in February 2013 after he was arrested on \nrape charges. (GE 1; AEs D-E; Tr. 23-24.) \n\n3 \n \nApplicant and his now ex-wife married in July 2006, when their daughter was age 2 \nand her daughter from a previous relationship was about to turn age 6. They had a son in \nMarch 2008. Applicant and his ex-wife separated permanently in late February 2013 after \nhis arrest on charges of raping his stepdaughter. (GE 1.) His ex-wife filed for divorce in \n2013, and their divorce was final in January 2017.1 (GE 2.) \n \nOn February 28, 2013, Applicant\u2019s stepdaughter, then 12-years-old, told her mother \nthat Applicant had sexually assaulted her on eight to ten occasions in their home, to as \nrecently as only five days prior. She described incidents of sexual penetration (rape) and \nthreats from Applicant to beat her with a belt if she told anyone about the assaults. \nApplicant\u2019s now ex-wife called the police, who, on responding, noticed that Applicant\u2019s \nstepdaughter appeared visibly upset. Applicant\u2019s stepdaughter reportedly had red and \nswollen eyes from crying, a flushed face, and hunched posture so that she appeared to be \nhunched in on herself. The police did not interview the girl at that time, but they obtained \nan account from Applicant\u2019s ex-wife of what her daughter had told her about the assaults. \nApplicant\u2019s ex-wife told the police that her daughter has a close relationship with Applicant, \nwhom she regarded as her father. The police arrested Applicant for rape of a child with \nforce and with intimidation of a witness for an offense that allegedly occurred on February \n23, 2013, and for two counts of rape of a child with force for offenses that reportedly \noccurred between July 1, 2012, and February 23, 2013. Applicant\u2019s ex-wife obtained an \nemergency restraining order against him, and a report was filed with the Department of \nChildren and Families (DCF). (GE 5.) Applicant was in custody for a week after his arrest. \n(Tr. 26.) \n \nAvailable police records show that the police interviewed a friend of Applicant\u2019s \nstepdaughter, who had been identified as one of the first people she had told about the \nsexual assaults. According to this friend, who was then 13 years old and a close \nclassmate, Applicant\u2019s stepdaughter related to her that she had been abused by Applicant \nfor a while, and she feared for her half-sister\u2019s safety. Applicant\u2019s stepdaughter was crying, \nshaking, and speaking with a voice that was cracking when she told the friend about the \nassaults. (GE 5.) \n \nOn May 29, 2013, a grand jury indicted Applicant on twelve felony counts for crimes \nallegedly committed by him on his stepdaughter on diverse dates between July 20, 2009, \nand February 2013, to wit: aggravated rape of a child (four counts); assault with a \ndangerous weapon (a belt) (one count); indecent assault and battery on a child under age \n14 (six counts); and assault to rape a child (one count). (GE 4.) On June 19, 2013, \nApplicant advised his security office at work that he had been arrested and charged with \nthree counts of forcible rape on a child and \u201cwitness/juror/police/court office intimidation on \nFebruary 28, 2013.2 The security office issued an adverse incident report to DOHA on June \n                                                 \n1 Applicant testified at his hearing that his ex-wife filed for divorce in 2014, about a year after he was accused \nof raping his stepdaughter. (Tr. 35.) However, he indicated during his subject interview in July 2016 that his ex-\nwife filed shortly after his arrest. (GE 2.) \n \n2 Applicant testified discrepantly at this hearing that there was a delay of \u201ca couple of months\u201d in him reporting \nhis arrest. (Tr. 27-28, 46.) \n\n4 \n \n19, 2013, of Applicant\u2019s arrest, stating in part: \u201c[Applicant] failed to report the exact charges \nto security and also admitted to \u2018being scared\u2019 as a reason for not reporting it sooner.\u201d (GE \n3.) Applicant testified at his February 2019 security clearance hearing that he reported his \narrests to his supervisor, who walked him to their security office. (Tr. 47.) When asked why \nhe delayed reporting his arrest to his security officials, Applicant denied that he was \nscared. He maintained that he was stressed, but primarily focused on taking care of his \nfamily. (Tr. 27-28, 51.) He understood at the time that he was required to report his arrest \nwhen it happened. (Tr. 46.) \n \nApplicant entered pleas of not guilty to the 12 felony counts at his arraignment on \nJune 24, 2013. (GE 6.) On August 12, 2013, the state filed with the trial court a statement \nof the case in which it summarized that Applicant abused the victim from when she was \nnine years old; that the abuse progressed from fondling to rape; that Applicant threatened \nto beat the victim with a belt if she told anyone; that he had beaten her with a belt in the \npast; that the victim first disclosed the abuse to her friends from school; that when the \nvictim told her mother about the abuse, her mother called the police immediately; that \nApplicant was arrested in the family home that evening; that Applicant declined to make a \nstatement to the police; and that a grand jury indictment was returned against Applicant on \n12 counts on May 29, 2013. (GE 5.) \n \nThe attorney who represented Applicant during protracted proceedings in Superior \nCourt attests that the prosecutor offered plea bargains, which included a reduction in \nconfinement for Applicant and disposition of some allegations in return for a guilty plea. \nApplicant gave him clear instructions to reject any offers and prepare for trial. According to \nthe attorney, there was no scientific evidence linking Applicant to the crimes. (AE F.) A jury \ntrial was scheduled and then rescheduled several times to March 2, 2015. On February 26, \n2015, the state moved for a nolle prosequi on all of the charges at that time. After meeting \nwith the victim several times for the purposes of trial preparation, the state did not believe it \ncould meet its burden of proof beyond a reasonable doubt at trial. In addition, the state did \nnot believe it was in the victim\u2019s best interest to proceed at that time. (GE 5.) On March 3, \n2015, the state filed statements of nolle prosequi as to each of the 12 counts. (GE 6; AE \nA.) \n \nOn May 7, 2015, Applicant completed and certified to the accuracy of a \nQuestionnaire for National Security Positions (SF 86). In response to police record \ninquiries, Applicant listed only two charges, of sexual abuse and domestic violence, and \nstated: \n \nOn February 28, 2013, I was FALSELY accused of sexual abuse against my \nstepchild. Due to this, a restraining order was obtained by my wife. After an \nintensive investigation, on March 3, 2015, the [state name] declared a Nolle \nProsequi due to NO evidence and inconsistent stories by the accuser. \n \n \nApplicant responded affirmatively to whether there was currently a domestic \nviolence protective order or restraining order against him. He explained that a restraining \norder was issued against him on February 28, 2013, after he had been \u201cFALSELY accused \n\n5 \n \nof sexual abuse against [his] stepchild.\u201d He added that his wife obtained a temporary \nrestraining order against him to prevent him from seeing his children, but on May 19, 2015, \nthe family court will grant him visitation times and joint custody of his children. Applicant \nanswered \u201cYes\u201d to whether his security clearance eligibility had ever been denied, \nsuspended, or revoked and disclosed that the DOD suspended his Secret clearance in \napproximately August 2014 pending resolution of the criminal sexual assault charges. (GE \n1.) \n \n \nOn July 12, 2016, Applicant was interviewed at work by an authorized investigator \nfor the Office of Personnel Management (OPM). He explained that he and his spouse \nseparated because of the February 2013 allegations made against him, and that she filed \nfor divorce shortly after the allegations were made. He expected their divorce to be final on \nJuly 20, 2016; that he would be required to pay $370 per week in child support for his two \nchildren;3 and that  he will have unsupervised visitation with his children on Tuesdays and \nSundays. About the February 2013 criminal allegations, Applicant explained that the police \ncame to his house about 30 minutes after he had returned home from work; that he was \nplaced under arrest on alleged sexual abuse charges; that he had declined to provide a \nstatement to the police without an attorney present; that he was jailed for a few days until \nhis sister posted $50,000 bail for him; and that he was required to wear a GPS monitor and \nstay away from his marital residence as a condition of his bail. He indicated that in May \n2013, he found out that he was being indicted on five counts of sexual assault and one \ncount of intimidation of a witness. He was required to report to a probation officer once a \nweek from May 2013 to March 2015. Applicant explained that the charges were nolle \nprosequi without ever going to trial because there was not enough evidence to prosecute \nhim. He stated that despite the \u201cdismissal\u201d of the charges in March 2015, the restraining \norder against him was not removed until December 2015. (GE 2; AE C.) \n \n \nAfter being reminded by the OPM investigator that he was under oath and under the \npenalties for intentional misrepresentation or false statements set forth in Section 1001 of \nTitle 18 of the United States Code, Applicant denied ever touching his children \ninappropriately and indicated that the allegations against him were false. He stated that he \nwas unsure why his stepdaughter would fabricate these allegations against him, and \nasserted that there was no truth to them. He added that people who know him are \nsurprised by the allegations, and that the only person who disbelieves Applicant is his \nspouse. He could provide no reason why his wife sided with his stepdaughter other than \nthat the girl is her daughter. When asked about his delay in reporting his arrest, he \nindicated that he was trying to get his personal life in order, which was more important to \nhim at that time. He denied the delay was because he feared he might lose his job. He \ndenied that his arrest or the February 2013 allegations could be used against him because \nnothing happened. (GE 2; AE C.) \n \n  \nIn response to DOHA interrogatories, Applicant indicated on January 29, 2018, that \nalthough he and his ex-wife were officially divorced in January 2017, they \u201chave a healthy \nco-parenting and thoughtful parenting plan to ensure that [their] children have a happy, \n                                                 \n3 On September 18, 2015, an adverse incident report was filed by Applicant\u2019s employer noting that Applicant\u2019s \nwages were garnished in August 2015 for child support of almost $2,015. (GE 3.) \n\n6 \n \nhealthy, stable, and balance[d] life.\u201d (GE 2.) At his hearing held in February 2019, Applicant \nindicated that he has unsupervised contact with his two children three days a week. (Tr. \n25.) He provided a \u201cbiography\u201d (AE E) in which he stated in part: \n \nUnfortunately, due to false allegations, our family had to struggle through \ntough times. Now, even though we are divorced, we are closer than ever and \nwe are successfully co-parenting our children. We are working together for a \nbrighter future for all of us. \n \n \nApplicant denies any truth to any of the sexual assault crimes alleged against him by \nhis stepdaughter or any tampering with a witness. (Tr. 29-33.) He had no explanation for \nwhy his ex-wife filed for divorce, although he assumed it was \u201cbased on the false \nallegations.\u201d Applicant claims he had an \u201cexcellent\u201d relationship with his ex-wife at the time, \nand he does not know why his ex-wife believes that he raped her daughter. (Tr. 36, 50.) \nApplicant acknowledged that he has no visitation rights to see his stepdaughter, with whom \nhe claimed he had a wonderful relationship before she accused him of the crimes. He \ncould provide no reason why his stepdaughter would falsely accuse him. (Tr. 50-52.) \n \n \nApplicant presented no statements from his ex-wife, other family members, co-\nworkers, or friends. He provided his annual performance evaluations for 2009 through \n2017, which detail his contributions to his defense-contractor employer. Applicant has \nconsistently met, and since 2012 exceeded, his work requirements while needing minimal \nsupervision. Detailed-oriented and a team player, Applicant has displayed a positive \nattitude and extreme flexibility in fulfilling work assignments. He has worked extra hours, \nincluding on weekends, to support program schedules. Applicant delivered \u201csuperior results \nin 2015.\u201d In 2016, he supported a very active test area. He was considered to be a valuable \nasset to the test engineering organization. By 2017, he had become the \u201cgo to guy\u201d and a \nsubject matter expert as it related to high power testing. He was given an overall rating of \n\u201cHighly Effective Contribution\u201d for 2017. (AE B.) \n \nPolicies \n \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion the Executive \nBranch has in regulating access to information pertaining to national security,  emphasizing \nthat \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 \nU.S. 518, 528 (1988). When evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, \nthe administrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are required to be considered in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. These guidelines \nare not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, \nthese guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative \nprocess. The administrative judge\u2019s overall adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious \nscrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative \n\n7 \n \njudge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, \nfavorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence \nto establish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant \nis responsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation about potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Section 7 of EO 10865 \nprovides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a \ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section \n3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information). \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline J: Criminal Conduct \n \n \nThe security concern about criminal conduct is articulated in AG \u00b6 30: \n \nCriminal activity creates doubt about a person\u2019s judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person\u2019s ability or \nunwillingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 31 lists one condition that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying in this case: \n \n(b) evidence (including, but not limited to, a credible allegation, an admission, \nand matters of official record) of criminal conduct, regardless of whether the \nindividual was formally charged, prosecuted, or convicted. \n \n \nIn May 2013, Applicant was indicted by a grand jury on twelve felony counts for \ncrimes allegedly committed by him on his stepdaughter on diverse dates between July 20, \n2009, and February 2013, to wit: aggravated rape of a child (four counts); assault with a \ndangerous weapon (a belt) (one count); indecent assault and battery on a child under age \n\n8 \n \n14 (six counts); and assault to rape a child (one count). The indictment indicates the grand \njury believed Applicant committed felonious sexual assaults on his stepdaughter between \n2009 and February 2018 and that he threatened to assault her if she told anyone about the \nassaults.4  \n \n \nA grand jury is afforded a wide latitude to inquire into violations of criminal law. It \nmay compel the production of evidence or the testimony of witnesses as it considers \nappropriate without restraint by the technical procedural and evidentiary rules governing \ncriminal trials. The evidentiary standard for a grand jury indictment is probable cause to \nbelieve the defendant committed the offense. United States v. Sells Engineering, Inc., 463 \nU.S. 418 at 423 (1983). Probable cause exists where the facts and circumstances are \nreasonably trustworthy and \u201csufficient in themselves to warrant a man of reasonable \ncaution in his belief that an offense has been or is being committed.\u201d Brinegar v. United \nStates, 338 U.S. 160, 176 (1949).5 Probable cause does not require a finding that a fact be \nmore likely true than false. See Texas v. Brown, 460 U.S. 730, 742 (1983). In the state at \nissue, probable cause requires more than mere suspicion but something less than \nevidence sufficient to warrant a conviction. See Commonwealth v. Hason, 439 N.E. 2d 251, \n255 (1982). Moreover, the state\u2019s criminal procedure rules (Rule 4(c)) re-affirm a long-\nrecognized rule in the state that evidence which is not legally competent at trial may be \nsufficient for an indictment and an indictment based exclusively on hearsay will not be \ninvalidated at trial for that reason. \n \n  \nGiven Applicant denies any validity to the alleged crimes, the burden is on the \nGovernment of establishing the criminal behavior alleged in the SOR. See Directive \u00b6 \nE3.1.14. The Government is not required to establish Applicant\u2019s culpability beyond a \nreasonable doubt. Security clearance proceedings employ the \u201csubstantial evidence\u201d \nevidentiary standard, which is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). Substantial evidence is \n\u201csuch relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a \nconclusion.\u201d Richardson v. Perales, 402 U.S. 389, 401 (1971). See ISCR Case No. 15-\n05049 at 4 (App. Bd. July 12, 2017) (\u201cA Judge\u2019s material findings must be based on \nsubstantial evidence or constitute reasonable inferences or conclusions that could be \ndrawn from the evidence.\u201d) (citing ISCR Case No. 12-03420 at 3 (App. Bd. July 25, 2014)). \n \n \nThe Government\u2019s evidence includes police reports containing contemporaneous \nsummaries of interviews of Applicant\u2019s ex-wife and a close friend of Applicant\u2019s \nstepdaughter about the sexual assaults as detailed to them by Applicant\u2019s stepdaughter. \nAlthough hearsay in nature, their accounts cannot be dismissed outright as unreliable. \nThere is no apparent motive for either of them to have made false statements to the police \nabout what they were told. Applicant\u2019s ex-wife is unlikely to have pressured her daughter to \n                                                 \n4 The state\u2019s rules of criminal procedure may be accessed at www.mass.gov. Under Rule 5 concerning grand \njuries, an indictment may be found only upon the concurrence of 12 or more jurors. \n \n5 There is probable cause to indict a suspect \u201cif there is sufficient evidence to establish the identity of the \naccused, and probable cause to arrest him or her.\u201d  Commonwealth v. Caracciola, 409 Mass. 648, 650, 569 \nN.E.2d 774 (1991).  \n \n\n9 \n \nlie if she had as close a relationship with Applicant as he claims. Applicant presented no \nevidence that a classmate of Applicant\u2019s stepdaughter had anything to gain by lying to the \npolice. There is no statement in evidence from Applicant\u2019s stepdaughter, but the grand jury \nindictment and the statements to the police from her mother and friend constitute \nprobative, reliable evidence that may be considered in these proceedings, and together \nraise security concerns under AG \u00b6 31(b). \n  \n \nApplicant\u2019s case for mitigation under AG \u00b6 32(c) is that there is \u201cno reliable evidence \nto support that the individual committed the offense.\u201d It relies on his denials of culpability \nand on the nolle prosequi of the charges. The state\u2019s declination to continue prosecution \nonly days before Applicant\u2019s scheduled trial was based on the best interests of the \nstepdaughter, but also because the state did not think that it could prove the charges \nbeyond a reasonable doubt. The state provides for dismissal of charges by the \nprosecution.6  Under rule 16(b) of its criminal procedure rules, the entry of nolle prosequi to \neach of the 12 counts is not the equivalent of an acquittal, unless jeopardy has attached. \nJeopardy does not attach before trial has commenced.7 There is no evidence that the \nintegrity of the grand jury was impaired, and it required more than mere suspicion to indict \nApplicant. The exercise of the prosecution\u2019s discretionary authority to decline further \nprosecution in this case is not a finding of no culpability. The district attorney could bring \nnew charges at some future date, although given it has been more than four years with no \nevidence of any action, there appears to be little likelihood new charges would be brought \nwithout some new incriminating evidence.  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s decision not to accept a plea bargain also does not prove his innocence. \nHe faced possible incarceration for a minimum of ten years had he been convicted of \naggravated rape of his stepdaughter,8 and he may have chosen to proceed to trial \n                                                 \n6 Criminal Procedure Rule 16(a) provides: \n \n(a) A prosecuting attorney may enter a nolle prosequi of pending charges at any time prior to \nthe pronouncement of sentence. A nolle prosequi shall be accompanied by a written \nstatement, signed by the prosecuting attorney, setting forth the reasons for that disposition. \n \n7 See Commonwealth v. Massod, 350 Mass. 745 (1966). \n \n8 Section 23A of Chapter 265 of the state\u2019s general laws makes aggravated rape punishable as follows: \n \nSection 23A. Whoever unlawfully has sexual intercourse or unnatural sexual intercourse, and \nabuses a child under 16 years of age and: \n \n(a) there exists more than a 5 year age difference between the defendant and the victim and \nthe victim is under 12 years of age; \n \n(b) there exists more than a 10 year age difference between the defendant and the victim \nwhere the victim is between the age of 12 and 16 years of age; or \n \n(c) at the time of such intercourse, was a mandated reporter as defined in section 21 of \nchapter 119, shall be punished by imprisonment in the state prison for life or for any term of \nyears, but not less than 10 years. The sentence imposed on such person shall not be \nreduced to less than 10 years, or suspended, nor shall any person convicted under this \nsection be eligible for probation, parole, work release, or furlough or receive any deduction \n\n10 \n \ncalculating that the evidence was not strong enough to convict him. He was zealously \nrepresented in the criminal proceedings, and he had discovery of the prosecution\u2019s case. \nHis attorney indicates that there was no scientific evidence linking Applicant to the crime. \nHowever, this statement does not establish that there was no physical evidence of injury to \nthe victim. \n \n \nApplicant demonstrated a lack of candor about the criminal charges and his family \nrelationships during the investigation and adjudication of his security clearance eligibility. \nBecause of his lack of candor during the security clearance process, the credibility of his \ndenials of committing sex crimes is diminished. The incident report filed by his employer\u2019s \nsecurity office in June 2013 indicates that Applicant minimized the extent of his charges to \nsecurity. On his SF 86 in May 2015, he listed only two charges, of sexual abuse and \ndomestic violence, when he had been charged with 12 felony counts, including aggravated \nrape. He told an OPM investigator in July 2016 that he found out in May 2013 that he was \nbeing indicted on five counts of sexual assault and one count of intimidation of a witness. \nApplicant is reported to have been \u201csurprised and shocked\u201d when he learned of the \nallegations against him. Although he is not a lawyer, Applicant is a college graduate who \ncan reasonably be expected to have known and understood the specific criminal charges \nagainst him. Moreover, he had no credible explanation during his subject interview or at his \nsecurity clearance hearing for the accusations of abuse or his divorce. He maintained that \nhe had good relationships with his ex-wife and his children, which cannot easily be \nreconciled with the fact of his divorce or with the fact that his ex-wife believes her daughter. \nIt is difficult to accept as credible that he does not know the grounds for his divorce and \nthat he never discussed his stepdaughter\u2019s accusations with his ex-wife. Applicant told the \nOPM investigator that his ex-wife filed for divorce shortly after his arrest in February 2013. \nHe now claims that she did not file for about a year. It is noted that when the police came \nto Applicant\u2019s residence, they observed Applicant\u2019s stepdaughter to be upset. She had \nbeen crying, her posture was hunched, and she was drawn in on herself. Her demeanor \nwas consistent with that of a victim. His denials of any inappropriate behavior with his \nstepdaughter lack credibility. He did not present any statements from the victim that she \nrecanted the allegations of sexual assault. I have considerable suspicions that he sexually \nabused his stepdaughter, and I cannot say there is \u201cno reliable evidence\u201d to conclude he \ncommitted the sexual crimes at issue. \n \nGuideline E: Personal Conduct \n \n \nThe security concern about personal conduct is articulated in AG \u00b6 15: \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions about \nan individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified or \nsensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to cooperate or provide \n                                                                                                                                                             \nfrom his sentence for good conduct until he shall have served 10 years of such sentence. \nProsecutions commenced under this section shall neither be continued without a finding nor \nplaced on file. \n\n11 \n \ntruthful and candid answers during national security investigations or \nadjudicative processes. \n \n \nApplicant did not comply with his obligation as a clearance holder to timely report his \narrest to security officials. He was arrested on February 28, 2013, and did not report his \narrest until June 19, 2013. AG \u00b6 16(d) and AG \u00b6 16(e) apply because of the failure to report \nas alleged in SOR \u00b6 2.a. These provide: \n \n(d) credible adverse information that is not explicitly covered under any other \nguideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an adverse determination, but \nwhich, when combined with all available information, supports a whole-\nperson \nassessment \nof \nquestionable \njudgment, \nuntrustworthiness, \nunreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and \nregulations, or other characteristics indicating that the individual may not \nproperly safeguard classified or sensitive information; and \n \n(e) personal conduct, or concealment of information about one\u2019s conduct, \nthat creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress by a \nforeign intelligence entity or other individual or group. Such conduct includes: \n \n(1) engaging in activities which, if known, could affect the person\u2019s personal, \nprofessional, or community standing. \n \n \nApplicant is alleged to have deliberately lied on his SF 86 (SOR \u00b6 2.b) and during \nhis subject interview (SOR \u00b6 2.c) by claiming that he was falsely accused by his \nstepdaughter of the criminal sexual abuse. A predicate finding that Applicant committed the \ncrimes for which he was arrested and indicted is required before I can conclude that he \ndeliberately lied under AG \u00b6 16(a) as to the SF 86 and AG \u00b6 16(b) as to his interview. For \nthe reasons addressed under Guideline J, I find reliable evidence exists of his culpability. \nDisqualifying conditions AG \u00b6\u00b6 16(a) and 16(b) apply. They provide: \n \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar \nform used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, \naward benefits or status, determine national security eligibility or \ntrustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities; and \n \n(b) deliberately providing false or misleading information; or concealing or \nomitting information, concerning relevant facts to an employer, investigator, \nsecurity official, competent medical or mental health professional involved in \nmaking a recommendation relevant to a national security eligibility \ndetermination, or other official government representative. \n \n \nI note that Applicant was not fully candid on his SF 86 or during his interview about \nthe charges filed against him. He listed only two charges, of sexual abuse and domestic \nviolence, when he knew he had been incited on 12 very serious felony counts, including \nrape. His minimization cannot be considered a disqualifying factor because it was not \n\n12 \n \nspecifically alleged, but it shows a lack of reform and whether his representations are \nreliable. \n \n \nThe SOR also alleges his arrest and the criminal charges under Guideline E (SOR \u00b6 \n2.d). Sexual assault of a minor female is conduct which raises considerable judgment \nconcerns under AG \u00b6 15 and vulnerability issues under AG \u00b6 16(e). \n \n \nThree mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 17 have some applicability. They are: \n \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is so \ninfrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is unlikely \nto recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling to \nchange the behavior or taken positive steps to alleviate the stressors, \ncircumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, unreliable, or \nother inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to recur; and \n \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate vulnerability \nto exploitation manipulation, or duress. \n \n \nThe passage of more than five years since the sex crimes is a factor in mitigation \nunder AG \u00b6 17(c). Applicant made some effort to alleviate the concerns of his failure to \nreport under AG \u00b6 17(d) and of vulnerability under AG \u00b6 17(e) by notifying security about \nhis arrest in June 2013, but his disclosure was incomplete. Available information shows \nthat he was intentionally minimizing to his employer when he described the charges filed \nagainst him. He reportedly told security officials that he had delayed informing them of his \narrest because he was scared. At his subject interview, he explained that it was more \nimportant to him to get his personal life in order. He now attributes his failure to timely \nreport to concentrating on caring for his family. None of these reasons justifies his \ndeliberate failure to comply with his known obligation to report adverse information to \nsecurity officials. He did not accurately disclose the criminal counts against him on his SF \n86 or during his subject interview, even though the charges had been nolle prosequi. Little \ninformation was presented about who knows about his arrest record and what they know. \nApplicant has yet to show that he can be counted on to comply with his reporting \nobligations in the future. His persistent denials of any validity to the criminal accusations \nare suspect and continue to cast doubt on his reform. The personal conduct security \nconcerns are not fully mitigated. \n \nGuideline D: Sexual Behavior \n \n \nThe security concerns about sexual behavior are articulated in AG \u00b6 12: \n \nSexual behavior that involves a criminal offense; reflects a lack of judgment \nor discretion; or may subject the individual to undue influence of coercion, \n\n13 \n \nexploitation, or duress. These issues, together or individually, may raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s judgment, reliability, trustworthiness, and \nability to protect classified for sensitive information. Sexual behavior includes \nconduct occurring in person or via audio, visual, electronic, or written \ntransmission. No adverse inference concerning the standards in this \nGuideline may be raised solely on the basis of the sexual orientation of the \nindividual. \n \n \nThe sex crimes for which Applicant was indicted raise disqualifying conditions AG \u00b6  \n13(a), \u201csexual behavior of a criminal nature, whether or not the individual has been \nprosecuted,\u201d 13(c), \u201csexual behavior that causes an individual to be vulnerable to coercion, \nexploitation, or duress;\u201d and 13(d), \u201csexual behavior  . . . that reflects a lack of discretion or \njudgment.\u201d Given the reliable evidence of sexual assault, and his refusal to acknowledge \nany sexual misconduct, none of the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 14 are fully \nestablished. The passage of time alone is insufficient for mitigation under AG \u00b6 14(b) \nbecause of the egregiousness of the behavior. AG \u00b6 14(b) provides: \n \n(b) sexual behavior happened so long ago, so infrequently, or under such \nunusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on \nthe individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or judgment. \n \n \nApplicant testified that when he told his supervisor about his arrest, his supervisor \nwalked him to their security office. Even so, it is unclear what he told his supervisor. He \nminimized the charges to security officials and on his SF 86. Applicant did not establish AG \n\u00b6 14(c), \u201cthe behavior no longer serves as a basis for coercion, exploitation, or duress.\u201d  \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \nIn the whole-person evaluation, the administrative judge must consider the totality of \nan applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant circumstances in light of the nine adjudicative \nprocess factors in AG \u00b6 2(d).9 \n \nApplicant was indicted by a grand jury for 12 serious crimes, any of which are too \negregious to warrant restoration to him of his suspended Secret clearance. He presented \nno reliable evidence to substantiate his claim that none of the criminal accusations have \nmerit. Moreover, there exists a substantial reason to doubt Applicant\u2019s continued security \nclearance eligibility in that he knew he had an obligation to report his arrest and charges to \nhis employer, and he deliberately waited until June 2013, several months after he had \n                                                 \n9 The factors under AG \u00b6 2(d) are as follows: \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the \nconduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the \nconduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other \npermanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for \npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or \nrecurrence. \n\n14 \n \nbeen first arrested and a month after he was indicted. Applicant did not accurately disclose \nthe charges to his employer, on his SF 86, or during his subject interview. He testified \nevasively when asked about the serious criminal charges and his family relations, leaving \nthe impression that he might say something incriminating if he elaborated. \n \n \nUnder the whole-person evaluation, Applicant\u2019s work performance for his employer \nis unassailable, but it does not entitle him to a clearance. The security clearance \nadjudication involves an evaluation of an applicant\u2019s judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness in light of the security guidelines in the Directive. See ISCR Case No. 09-\n02160 (App. Bd. Jun. 21, 2010). It is well settled that once a concern arises regarding an \napplicant\u2019s security clearance eligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or \nrenewal of a security clearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th Cir. \n1990). For the reasons noted above, I am unable to conclude that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue access to classified information to Applicant. \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline J:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \nFor Applicant10 \nSubparagraph 1.b:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraphs 2.a-2.d: \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nParagraph 3, Guideline D:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraph 3.a:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances, it is not clearly consistent with the national \ninterest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance. \n \n \n_____________________ \nElizabeth M.

Eligibility for \naccess to classified information is denied.  \n \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nOn February 9, 2017, the Department of Defense (DOD) issued a Statement of \nReasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing security concerns under Guideline B (foreign \ninfluence). The action was taken under Executive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; \nDOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review \nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines \n(AG) implemented by the DOD.1 \n \n                                                          \n1 I decided this case using the AG implemented by DOD on June 8, 2017. However, I also considered this \ncase under the previous AG implemented on September 1, 2006, and my conclusions are the same using \neither set of AG. \n \n\n2 \n \nApplicant responded to the SOR on February 22, 2017, and requested a hearing \nbefore an administrative judge. The case was assigned to me on November 1, 2018. \nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a notice of hearing on \nNovember 27, 2018, scheduling the hearing for December 14, 2018.  \n \nI convened the hearing as scheduled. Department Counsel requested that I take \nadministrative notice of certain facts about the People\u2019s Republic of China (China). The \nrequest was not admitted in evidence but was appended to the record as Hearing \nExhibit (HE) I. The facts administratively noticed are summarized in the Findings of \nFact, below. Government Exhibits (GE) 1 and 2 were admitted in evidence without \nobjection. Applicant testified and submitted Applicant Exhibits (AE) A through E, which I \nadmitted in evidence without objection. DOHA received the hearing transcript (Tr.) on \nJanuary 2, 2019.  \n  \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant admitted all of the SOR allegations. He is 48 years old, married, and he \nhas two minor children. His wife was born in China and immigrated to the United States \nin 1996. She is a naturalized U.S. citizen, and their children are native-born U.S. \ncitizens. He has owned a home in the United States since 2005.2 \n \nApplicant was born in China. He graduated from a high school in China in 1988, \nand he obtained a bachelor\u2019s degree from a university in China in 1993. He immigrated \nto the United States in 1996 and was naturalized as a U.S. citizen in 2008. He obtained \na master\u2019s degree from a U.S. university in 2002. He has worked as a systems engineer \nfor his current employer, a DOD contractor, since 2016. He was granted access to \npublic trust information in 2011. He has never held a DOD security clearance.3  \n \nApplicant\u2019s mother, father, sister, mother-in-law, and father-in-law are citizens \nand residents of China. His mother and father are 75 and 82 years old, respectively. His \nmother retired as a school teacher at age 60. His father retired as a research institute \nprofessor between the age of 65 and 70. Applicant was unaware whether the research \ninstitute was affiliated with the Chinese government. Applicant testified that his father \nhas never served in the Chinese military.4   \n \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s parents live together in an apartment they own, the value of which \nApplicant was unaware. They are supported by their monthly pensions from the \nChinese government, totaling approximately $1,600 monthly. Applicant talks to his \nmother weekly, primarily to check on her health as she was diagnosed with cancer. He \ntalks to his father four to five times yearly. He visits his parents in China once every two \nyears and last did so in August 2018. He usually travels to China with his wife and \nchildren. His mother visited Applicant and his family in the United States in 2016. He \n \n                                                          \n2 Applicant\u2019s response to the SOR; Tr. at 6-7, 10-11, 14-16, 25-29, 37, 47-48; GE 1; AE A, B, C, D. \n \n3 Tr. at 14-16, 25-29, 50-52; GE 1; AE A, E. \n \n4 Tr. at 29-37, 46-47, 52-60; GE 1, 2; AE E. \n \n\n \n3 \n \nsent his parents approximately $1,000 in 2000, and he sends his mother vitamin \nsupplements that he buys in the United States. He testified that his parents are aware \nonly that he is an engineer.5  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s sister is 47 years old. She is married, and her husband is 48 years \nold. They are joint owners of a private business, having applied for and received their \nbusiness license from the Chinese government. Applicant testified that his brother-in-\nlaw never served in the Chinese military, but previously worked for the Chinese \ngovernment. When Applicant visits their parents in China, his sister makes the short trip \nto their parents\u2019 hometown so that Applicant can also see her.  Applicant talks to her \nfour to five times yearly.6 \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s mother-in-law and father-in-law are ages 74 and 75, respectively. \nThey are both retired. They live together in an apartment, the value of which Applicant \nwas unaware. They are also supported by their pensions from the Chinese government. \nHis mother-in-law previously worked as a school teacher. His father-in-law previously \nworked as a general manager of a private travel agency and a school teacher. Applicant \ntestified that neither served in the Chinese military. Applicant speaks to his parents-in-\nlaw two to three times yearly. His wife speaks to her parents weekly. Applicant and his \nwife visit her parents in China once every two years, when they visit his parents.7  \n \n \nApplicant has two sisters-in-law, one of whom resides in China and the other in \nCanada. The sister-in-law in China does not work outside of the home, and her husband \nis a small business owner. Applicant was unaware how often his wife spoke to her sister \nin China. He testified that he does not have any connection to either sister-in-law. He \ntestified that he was unaware whether his wife ever discussed with her family in China \nthe nature of his employment or that he is seeking a security clearance.8 \n \n \n \nApplicant maintains contact with friends who are citizens and residents of China. \nHe has known three to four of such friends since kindergarten. One is a stockbroker; the \nsecond works in information technology for an insurance company; the third is an \nassistant professor; and the fourth one is unemployed. He sees them when he travels to \nChina to visit his parents, and he saw three of them during his August 2018 trip. In \naddition, Applicant has known three to four other such friends since high school and \ncollege. One works for a bank; two are professors at a local college; and the fourth is a \nnurse at a local hospital. He also saw these friends when he visited China in August \n2018.9 \n \n                                                          \n5 Tr. at 29-37, 46-47, 52-60, 64-66; GE 1, 2; AE E. \n \n6 Tr. at 35-37, 46-47, 59-60; GE 1, 2; AE E. \n \n7 Tr. at 37-40, 47, 61-65; GE 1, 2; AE E. \n \n8 Tr. at 37-40, 47, 61-65; GE 2; AE E. \n \n9 Tr. at 40-46, 63-64; GE 2; AE E. \n\n \n4 \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s home was valued at $560,000 as of the date of the hearing. He and \nhis wife\u2019s checking, savings, and retirement accounts in the United States total \napproximately $1,000,000. They do not have any foreign assets. His July 2016 \nbackground interview reflects that he told the investigator that he is loyal solely to the \nUnited States. He testified that he is proud to be an American.10 \n \n \nChina \n \nThe National Counterintelligence Executive has identified China as among the \nmost aggressive collectors of U.S. economic information and technology. China\u2019s \nintelligence services, as well as private companies and other entities, frequently seek to \nexploit Chinese citizens or persons with family ties to China who can use their insider \naccess to corporate networks to steal secrets using removable media devices or email.  \nChinese attempts to collect U.S. economic and technological information will continue at \na high level and will represent a growing threat to U.S. economic security. The nature of \nthe cyber threat will evolve with continuing technological advances in the global \ninformation environment. China\u2019s military modernization is targeting capabilities with the \npotential to degrade core U.S. military-technological advances.  \n \n \nChina is an authoritarian state in which the Chinese Communist Party is the \nparamount authority, with its members holding almost all top government and security \napparatus positions. Humans rights concerns observed in 2017 included arbitrary or \nunlawful deprivation of life; executions without due process; forced disappearances; \ntorture and coerced confessions of prisoners; arbitrary detention; illegal detention at \nunofficial holding facilities; significant restrictions on freedom of speech, press, \nassembly, religion, and movement. Authorities continued to maintain ultimate authority \nover all published, online, and broadcast material. \n \n \nThe U.S. Department of State warns visitors to China that they may be placed \nunder surveillance. Hotel rooms, offices, cars, taxis, telephones, internet usage, and fax \nmachines may be monitored onsite or remotely. Personal possessions in hotel rooms, \nincluding computers, may be searched without knowledge or consent.  \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \n                                                          \n10 Tr. at 46-50; GE 1, 2; AE A, B. \n\n \n5 \n \nto AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.  \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nSection 7 of Exec. Or. 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms \nof the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also Exec. Or. 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple \nprerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline B, Foreign Influence \n \nThe security concern for foreign influence is set out in AG \u00b6 6:       \nForeign contacts and interests, including, but not limited to, business, \nfinancial, and property interests, are a national security concern if they \nresult in divided allegiance. They may also be a national security concern \nif they create circumstances in which the individual may be manipulated or \ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a \nway inconsistent with U.S. interests or otherwise made vulnerable to \npressure or coercion by any foreign interest. Assessment of foreign \ncontacts and interests should consider the country in which the foreign \ncontact or interest is located, including, but not limited to, considerations \nsuch as whether it is known to target U.S. citizens to obtain classified or \nsensitive information or is associated with a risk of terrorism. \n \n\n \n6 \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 7. The following are potentially applicable in this case:   \n \n(a) contact, regardless of method, with a foreign family member, business \nor professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or \nresident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of \nforeign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion;  \n \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual's obligation to \nprotect classified or sensitive information or technology and the \nindividual's desire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing \nthat information or technology; and \n \n(e) shared living quarters with a person or persons, regardless of \ncitizenship status, if that relationship creates a heightened risk of foreign \ninducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion. \n \nThe nature of a nation\u2019s government, its relationship with the United States, \nand its human rights record are relevant in assessing the likelihood that an applicant\u2019s \nfamily members are vulnerable to government coercion. The risk of coercion, \npersuasion, or duress is significantly greater if the foreign country has an \nauthoritarian government, a family member is associated with or dependent upon the \ngovernment, or the country is known to conduct intelligence operations against the \nUnited States. In considering the nature of the government, an administrative judge \nmust also consider any terrorist activity in the country at issue. See generally ISCR \nCase No. 02-26130 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 7, 2006) (reversing decision to grant \nclearance where administrative judge did not consider terrorist activity in area where \nfamily members resided). \n \nAG \u00b6 7(a) requires substantial evidence of a \u201cheightened risk.\u201d The \n\u201cheightened risk\u201d required to raise one of these disqualifying conditions is a relatively \nlow standard. \u201cHeightened risk\u201d denotes a risk greater than the normal risk inherent in \nhaving a family member living under a foreign government. \n \nApplicant\u2019s parents, sister, parents-in-law, and friends are citizens and residents \nof China. China has been identified as among the most aggressive collectors of U.S. \neconomic information and technology. China\u2019s intelligence services frequently seek to \nexploit Chinese citizens or persons with family ties to China who can use their insider \naccess to steal secrets. Visitors to China may be placed under surveillance, and \npersonal possessions in hotel rooms may be searched without knowledge or consent. \nApplicant\u2019s foreign contacts in China create a potential conflict of interest and a \nheightened risk of foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, and \ncoercion. AG \u00b6\u00b6 7(a), 7(b), and 7(e) have been raised by the evidence. \n \nConditions that could mitigate foreign influence security concerns are provided \nunder AG \u00b6 8. The following are potentially applicable: \n\n \n7 \n \n(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in which  \nthese persons are located, or the positions or activities of those persons in \nthat country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be placed in a \nposition of having to choose between the interests of a foreign individual, \ngroup, organization, or government and the interests of the United States; \n \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of \nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, or allegiance to the group, \ngovernment, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such deep and \nlongstanding relationships and loyalties in the United States, that the \nindividual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the \nU.S. interest; and \n \n(c) contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and \ninfrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign \ninfluence or exploitation. \n \nApplicant\u2019s parents, sister, parents-in-law, and friends are Chinese citizens \nresiding in China. Accordingly, AG \u00b6 8(a) is not established for the reasons set out in \nthe above discussion of AG \u00b6\u00b6 7(a), 7(b), and 7(e). Applicant regularly contacts his \nparents, sister, and parents-in-law. His wife also does the same with her parents. \nApplicant also sees his friends in China when he travels there to visit his family. AG \u00b6 \n8(c) is not established.  \n \nApplicant has lived in the United States since 1996. He obtained a master\u2019s \ndegree from a U.S. university in 2002. He became a naturalized U.S. citizen in 2008. \nHis wife is also a naturalized U.S. citizen, and their children are native-born U.S \ncitizens. They own a home and have substantial financial interests in the United States \nand none in China. These are factors that weigh in Applicant\u2019s favor. However, \nApplicant\u2019s ties to his family in China are equally as strong. Applicant failed to meet his \nburden to demonstrate that he would resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the U.S. \ninterest. AG \u00b6 8(b) is not established. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \n\n \n8 \n \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.        \n \nI have incorporated my comments under Guideline B in my whole-person \nanalysis. I considered Applicant\u2019s access to public trust information since 2011. After \nweighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under Guideline B, and evaluating \nall the evidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has not \nmitigated the security concerns raised by his family and friends in China. Accordingly, \nI conclude he has not carried his burden of showing that it is clearly consistent with \nthe national interest to grant him eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline B:  \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a - 1.d:  \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n________________________ \nCandace Le\u2019i Garcia \nAdministrative Judge \n",

    "full_text": "1 \n    DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE    \n DEFENSE OFFICE OF HEARINGS AND APPEALS \nIn the matter of: \n) \n) \n) \nISCR Case No. 16-03863 \n) \nApplicant for Security Clearance \n) \nAppearances \nFor Government: Andre M. Gregorian, Esq., Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro se \n______________ \nDecision \n______________ \nMATCHINSKI, Elizabeth M., Administrative Judge: \nApplicant has been married since March 2011 to a native of the Kyrgyz Republic \n(Kyrgyzstan) who became naturalized in the United States in June 2018. His spouse no \nlonger owns any property in the foreign country, and her daughter, a Kyrgyz citizen, has \nU.S. permanent residency. However, foreign influence security concerns are not fully \nmitigated because of his spouse\u2019s family ties to Kyrgyzstan, including a sibling who spent \nhis career with the Kyrgyz government. Clearance is denied. \nStatement of the Case \nOn April 4, 2018, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications Facility \n(DOD CAF) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant, detailing security \nconcerns under Guideline B, foreign influence. The SOR explained why the DOD CAF \nwas unable to find it clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue \nsecurity clearance eligibility for him. The DOD CAF took the action under Executive Order \n(EO) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as \namended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance \nReview Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the National Security \nAdjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information or \nEligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position (AG) effective within the DOD on June 8, 2017. \n01/31/2019\n\n \n \n2 \nApplicant responded to the SOR on May 2, 2018, and requested a hearing before \nan administrative judge from the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA). On \nSeptember 7, 2018, the case was assigned to me to conduct a hearing to determine \nwhether it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security \nclearance for Applicant. On October 5, 2018, I scheduled a hearing for November 15, \n2018. \n \nAt the hearing, three Government exhibits (GEs 1-3) were admitted. A May 30, \n2018 letter forwarding the proposed GEs to Applicant and a list of the GEs were marked \nas hearing exhibits (HEs I-II) for the record but not admitted in evidence. At the \nGovernment\u2019s request and without objection from Applicant, I agreed to take \nadministrative notice of several facts pertinent to the Kyrgyz Republic, as set forth in a \nMay 30, 2018 Request for Administrative Notice-Kyrgyzstan (Kyrgyz Republic),1 which \nwas entered in evidence as GE 3. Ten Applicant exhibits (AEs A-J) were admitted in \nevidence without objection. Applicant testified, as reflected in a transcript (Tr.) received \non November 29, 2018. \n \nI held the record open for three weeks after the hearing for Applicant to respond to \nGE 3 and to submit facts for administrative notice. On November 28, 2018, Applicant \nsubmitted four U.S. State Department reports on human rights in the Kyrgyz Republic \nand a Commission on Security and Cooperation in Europe (CSCE) article. The \ndocuments were admitted without objection as AE K. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nThe SOR alleges under Guideline B that Applicant\u2019s brother-in-law is a resident \ncitizen of Kyrgyzstan employed by the Kyrgyz government (SOR \u00b6 1.a); that Applicant\u2019s \nspouse (SOR \u00b6 1.b) and daughter-in-law (SOR \u00b6 1.c) are Kyrgyz citizens; that Applicant\u2019s \nfather-in-law is a resident citizen of Kyrgyzstan (SOR \u00b6 1.d); and that Applicant\u2019s spouse \nowns an apartment in Kyrgyzstan valued at approximately $45,000 (SOR \u00b6 1.e.). In a \ndetailed response to the SOR, Applicant indicated that with a change in leadership in the \nKyrgyz Republic following October 2017 elections, his brother-in-law has been removed \nfrom his government position, and his employment status was unclear. Applicant \nexplained that his immediate family had no direct contact with him and so learned about \nhis status from extended family members. Applicant admitted that his spouse and \nstepdaughter had Kyrgyz citizenship, but his spouse\u2019s U.S. citizenship test was scheduled \nfor May 30, 2018. His stepdaughter was employed in the United States and planned to \napply for her U.S. citizenship at her earliest opportunity next year. Applicant admitted his \nfather-in-law\u2019s residency and citizenship in Kyrgyzstan. Regarding the apartment in the \nKyrgyz Republic, Applicant explained that his spouse sold the apartment in June 2017 \nafter his stepdaughter graduated from college in Kyrgyzstan. \n \n \nAfter considering the pleadings, exhibits, and transcript, I make the following \nfindings of fact. \n                                                 \n1 The country is formally known as the Kyrgyz Republic, although the country is often referred to as \nKyrgyzstan. The U.S. government uses the terms interchangeably when referring to the country. \n\n \n \n3 \nApplicant is a 56-year-old global security specialist, who has worked for his current \nemployer, a defense contractor, since December 2016. (GE 1; Tr. 48.) He attended \ncollege on a Reserve Officer Training Corps (ROTC) scholarship, and earned a \nbachelor\u2019s degree in aerospace engineering. He entered on active duty in the U.S. military \nin April 1984. (GE 1.) He held a DOD security clearance throughout his active duty service \nand worked on several classified programs. (Tr. 26-27, 44.) Applicant married in \nDecember 1986, but he and his first wife divorced in August 1988. (GE 1; Tr. 49.) \n \nIn April 1990, Applicant was granted an honorable discharge from active duty, and \nhis clearance eligibility lapsed for about a year. (Tr. 47.) In February 1991, Applicant and \nhis second wife married, and they had a son in March 1993. (GE 1.) From April 1993 to \nAugust 2004, Applicant worked as a civilian contractor with a clearance at a U.S. military \nresearch laboratory. After being in the inactive reserve for six years, he returned to the \nmilitary as an active reservist in 1996. (GEs 1-2; Tr. 27, 47.)  \n \nFrom August 2004 to December 2005, Applicant was employed as a program \ndirector for a federal contractor at a space center. In January 2006, he began teaching at \na public university as a state employee. (GE 1.) He continued to maintain security \nclearance eligibility for his duties in his military reserve unit, and he was called to active \nduty during the summers. From June 2006 to September 2006, he was stationed in the \nKyrgyz Republic as an active-duty reservist. Applicant became friends with his current \nwife, a native Kyrgyz resident citizen who worked as a contractor at the base\u2019s exchange. \n(Tr. 51.) Applicant was stationed in the United States during the summer of 2007, and \nwas deployed to Tajikistan in the summer of 2008. (GE 2; Tr. 45-46.) \n \nIn June 2009, Applicant left his job as a university lecturer. He was recalled to \nactive duty that summer and served in Europe. He and his current spouse began dating \nin July 2009. (Tr. 43, 51.) From November 2009 to May 2012, he was stationed in the \nKyrgyz Republic as an active duty reservist for the U.S. military at the rank of lieutenant \ncolonel. Applicant and his current spouse continued dating. In December 2010, \nApplicant\u2019s divorce from his second wife was finalized. (GEs 1-2.) \n \nIn March 2011, Applicant and his current spouse married in the Kyrgyz Republic. \n(GE 1; Tr. 52.) She had been previously married against her will, and had two children, \nincluding a daughter born in June 1995 who took Applicant\u2019s surname on her mother\u2019s \nmarriage to Applicant.2 (GE 1; AE G.) Applicant met his spouse\u2019s family members while \nhe was stationed in Kyrgyzstan, and he asserts that he reported his foreign marriage and \ncontacts as required to his command. (Tr. 27.) \n \n                                                 \n2 Applicant\u2019s spouse provided a statement in which she indicated that she was kidnapped and forced to \nmarry. (AE G.) Applicant testified that his spouse was kidnapped when she was 19 or 20 (Tr. 81), although \naccording to his SF 86 (GE 1), she retained the same name from her birth in January 1975 until January \n2006, when she was 30 years old. She indicated that after she left her first husband, she was forced out of \nher brother\u2019s apartment when she had no income and two children to support. (AE G.) Applicant listed only \nhis stepdaughter on his SF 86 (GE 1) and little to nothing is known about his spouse\u2019s other child, including \nwhether he or she is even alive. \n\n \n \n4 \nApplicant maintained a legal permanent residence in the United States, and he \nand his spouse had a son born in the United States in October 2011 and baptized in the \nUnited States in early June 2012. (GEs 1-2; AE I.) After his active duty deployment ended \nin May 2012, Applicant resumed his weekend reservist status until he retired from the \nmilitary as a colonel in May 2014. (Tr. 46.)  \n \nIn April 2012, Applicant\u2019s spouse purchased an apartment in Kyrgyzstan for \napproximately $45,000 so that her daughter (then age 16) would have a place to live while \nin college in the country. (GEs 1-2; Tr. 34, 58.) In early June 2012, Applicant began \nworking under a personal services contract as a member of the administrative and \ntechnical staff at a U.S. Embassy in Eastern Europe. Available records show that his DOD \nsecret clearance was transferred to his new position through reciprocity and that his \nspouse, his son from his second marriage, his young son from his current marriage, and \nhis stepdaughter were authorized to accompany him to his post in foreign country X. (AE \nJ.) Applicant testified that his family accompanied him to live on the embassy compound.3 \n(Tr. 27.) In August 2013, Applicant and his spouse had another son, who was born in the \nUnited States. (GE 1.) \n \nApplicant\u2019s stepdaughter finished high school in foreign country X and enrolled in \nengineering studies at a technical school. In the summer of 2013, she transferred to a \nuniversity in the Kyrgyz Republic that then closed. She then attended a private university \nin Kyrgyzstan that was started with the financial assistance of a U.S. philanthropist. \nClasses were in English and Russian. (AE A; Tr. 52, 55-56, 79.) \n \n   \nWhile working at the U.S. Embassy in foreign country X, Applicant started the \nprocess for his spouse and stepdaughter to legally immigrate to the United States. His \nspouse and stepdaughter became legal permanent residents in October 2014. (Tr. 28.) \n \nIn September 2015, Applicant\u2019s contract with the U.S. government ended. \nApplicant and his immediate family returned to the United States, and in November 2015, \nthey moved into a condominium in the United States owned by his parents. (GE 1; Tr. \n28.) As of March 2016, Applicant had a job offer with a defense contractor (not his current \nemployer) contingent on renewal of his security clearance eligibility. (Tr. 28.) He \ncompleted and certified to the accuracy of a Questionnaire for National Security Positions \n(SF 86) on March 28, 2016. He disclosed the Kyrgyz citizenship of his spouse and his \nstepdaughter; his stepdaughter\u2019s attendance at a university in Kyrgyzstan; and his father-\nin-law\u2019s Kyrgyz residency and citizenship. His mother-in-law was deceased. He indicated \nthat he had weekly contact with his stepdaughter and annual in-person contact with his \nfather-in-law, who is a retired. In response to any inquiry concerning foreign contacts, \nApplicant listed a brother-in-law, who works for a Kyrgyz police unit, with whom he had \nquarterly contact. In response to foreign government contacts, Applicant listed another \nbrother-in-law (brother-in-law X) who has intelligence duties for the Kyrgyz government. \nThey met occasionally at family events until as recently as October 2015. Applicant added \n                                                 \n3 Applicant discrepantly told an Office of Personnel Management (OPM) investigator in August 2016 that \nhis family resided at his U.S. home of record while he was working abroad and that he visited them when \non leave between October 2011 and September 2015. (GE 2.)  \n\n \n \n5 \nthat he had reported the contacts to security personnel, but was advised \u201cto report only if \ndiscussions stray from family activities,\u201d which had not occurred. Applicant also disclosed \nthat his spouse owned an apartment in the Kyrgyz Republic that she purchased for \n$45,000 in April 2012 after selling her previous home acquired in April 2006. Applicant \nlisted travel to Kyrgyzstan in August 2008 for tourism, in March 2014 to visit family and \nfriends, and in July 2015 and again from September 2015 to October 2015 for family \nreunions. He indicated that brother-in-law X attended the family reunions. (GE 1.) \n \nOn August 2, 2016, Applicant was interviewed by an authorized investigator for the \nOPM. Applicant related that his stepdaughter returns each year to Kyrgyzstan for college \nand that they have monthly contact when she is in Kyrgyzstan. Applicant denied any legal \ninvolvement in the purchase of his spouse\u2019s apartment in Kyrgyzstan, which had declined \nin value to approximately $35,000. He explained that the property would be sold when his \nstepdaughter graduates from college, Applicant was unable to provide information about \nhis father-in-law\u2019s residence or previous employments. As for his relationship to brother-\nin-law X, Applicant indicated that he had only incidental social contact with him in July \n2015 and October 2015 while visiting his spouse\u2019s family, and that their conversations \nwere limited to family matters. Applicant denied any vulnerability to foreign influence \nbecause of this family relationship and stated that he would immediately notify proper \nauthorities of any contacts, requests, or threats by foreign persons or organizations. \nApplicant denied any improper contact or pressure by anyone seeking classified or \nsensitive information during any of his foreign travels, including to the Kyrgyz Republic. \n(GE 2.) \n \nIn March 2016, Applicant\u2019s spouse changed her first name to an English name so \nthat her two young sons would not have to explain why their mother had a foreign name. \n(GE 1; AE G; Tr. 28, 82.) In December 2016, with his background investigation still \npending to renew his clearance to work for another defense contractor, Applicant \naccepted a position with his current employer that did not require a security clearance. \nHe withdrew his application to renew his security clearance on receipt of an SOR alleging \nforeign influence security concerns. (Tr. 28-29, 48.) \n \nIn early June 2017, Applicant\u2019s stepdaughter earned her bachelor\u2019s degree in \nbusiness from the university in the Kyrgyz Republic and returned to the United States. \n(AE B; Tr. 56.) Two weeks later, Applicant\u2019s spouse sold her apartment in Kyrgyzstan, \nand sales proceeds of $35,435 were wired into Applicant\u2019s checking account in the United \nStates. (AE D; Tr. 35, 59.) In July 2017, they used $30,632 of the funds as the down-\npayment for Applicant and his spouse\u2019s current residence. (AE E; Tr. 37, 58-59.) They \nbought their home for $515,000 in part with a mortgage loan of $496,588. (AE C; Tr. 59.) \n \nAbout a year into his current employment, Applicant\u2019s employer requested that he \nobtain a security clearance for some military programs. On April 4, 2018, the DOD CAF \nissued a SOR alleging foreign influence security concerns because of Applicant\u2019s familial \nconnections to the Kyrgyz Republic and his spouse\u2019s apartment, which she no longer \nowned. (Tr. 29.) \n\n \n \n6 \nApplicant\u2019s spouse was interviewed for her U.S. naturalization in late May 2018. \n(AE A.) She took the oath of naturalization in June 2018, and within days she obtained \nher U.S. passport. (AEs G; H; Tr. 53.)  Applicant\u2019s spouse asserts that her loyalty is \u201cfirst \nand foremost to America and [her] American family.\u201d Although she and all of her siblings \ngraduated from college or took some advance coursework in the Kyrgyz Republic (Tr. \n84), Applicant\u2019s spouse asserts that she came from a traditional family that did not treat \ndaughters well. She was not allowed to return home after she was forced to marry, and \nafter she left her ex-husband, her brother (brother-in-law X) forced her from his apartment \nwhen she had no income and two children to support. Her family would not take her in, \nand she asserts that it \u201chardened [her] to the reality of Kyrgyz tradition.\u201d (AE G.) \n \nApplicant\u2019s stepdaughter also maintains that her full loyalty is to her American \nfamily. She considers Applicant to be her father. She has no desire to return to the Kyrgyz \nRepublic and intends to become a U.S. citizen when she is first eligible in October 2019. \nShe lives with Applicant and her mother, has a full-time job as a health service \ncoordinator, and pays taxes to the United States. Although she wishes her mother\u2019s family \nin Kyrgyzstan no harm, they did not treat her or her mother well. (AE F.) \n \nSince May 2012, when he closed a bank account that he had previously held while \nserving in the Kyrgyz Republic, Applicant\u2019s ties to Kyrgyzstan have been solely familial \nthrough his spouse. In addition to his father-in-law, six of his spouse\u2019s siblings (four \nbrothers and two sisters) live in the Kyrgyz Republic and speak Russian, which is still the \nbusiness language in the region. At least five if not all six of the siblings has Kyrgyz \ncitizenship.4 (Tr. 72-73, 80.) Applicant\u2019s spouse and perhaps all but one of her siblings \nattended college, although all of them had some type of advanced schooling.5 (Tr. 84-\n85.)  \n \nApplicant\u2019s father-in-law in Kyrgyzstan is now 80 years old and retired. Applicant \ndenies knowing about his father-in-law\u2019s previous occupation. He never asked his father-\n                                                 \n4 Four of the seven foreign contacts on Applicant\u2019s SF 86 are native Kyrgyz citizens. Applicant did not clearly \ndescribe his relationship with them apart from the brother-in-law, who had worked as a fraud investigator. \nThe foreign contacts include a 39-year-old working in Dubai who has the same surname as Applicant\u2019s \nfather-in-law; a 36-year-old married homemaker living in Australia; and a 32-year-old housekeeper (formerly \nan economics teacher) living in Kyrgyzstan. They may be siblings of Applicant\u2019s spouse, given they were \nall born in the same city as his spouse. (GE 1.) Whether due to lack of contact with them or limited \nknowledge, Applicant has not fully disclosed the extent of his spouse\u2019s family ties to Kyrgyzstan. \n \n5 Applicant testified, \u201cI know the family emphasized everyone going to college.\u201d (Tr. 84.) When confronted \nabout the inconsistency between his spouse\u2019s account that she came from such a traditional household \nthat she was forced to marry (bride kidnapping) and the family\u2019s emphasis on college for even the \ndaughters, Applicant responded: \n \nThe youngest [daughter] was the favorite, and so she went [to college]. The oldest one, I \nthink it had to do with the Soviet system, the two older ones. I mean the Soviet system \nwas\u2014it was, they grew up\u2014I don\u2019t remember when the Soviet Union fell, but they went \nduring the Soviet system, and so it was part of the process. And then my wife, she actually \nhad to fight to go [to college]. She went, but had to really convince a brother to help her \npay for school. (Tr. 85.) \n\n \n \n7 \nin-law whether he ever had any affiliation with the Kyrgyz military or government. \nApplicant\u2019s spouse calls her father once a month. To Applicant\u2019s knowledge, she has not \ntold her father that he is applying for a security clearance. (Tr. 61-62.) Applicant indicated \non his SF 86 that he had in-person contact with his father-in-law annually between June \n2010 and October 2015 (GE 1), although he now asserts that he probably saw his father-\nin-law during his trips to Kyrgyzstan. His spouse usually traveled to Kyrgyzstan before \nhim so she could stay longer to visit her relatives, including her father. (Tr. 63.) Applicant\u2019s \nfather-in-law speaks both the Kyrgyz and Russian languages but not English. Their \nconversations were limited because of the language barrier. When they occurred they \nwere in Russian because Applicant speaks a little Russian. (Tr. 37.) \n \nApplicant testified that he has heard that his spouse\u2019s brother in Kyrgyzstan, who \nhad worked in fraud investigations, is no longer so employed. He denies knowing about \nthis brother-in-law\u2019s current occupation. His spouse has contact with this brother on a \nmonthly basis. Applicant believes this brother-in-law does not know that he has applied \nfor a security clearance. (Tr. 71-72.) \n \nRegarding brother-in-law X, Applicant understands that he spent his entire career \nafter college with the Kyrgyz government. Although Applicant indicated in response to the \nSOR that this brother-in-law had been removed from his position with the change in \ngovernment in the country following the October 2017 elections, he testified there is no \nway of knowing for certain. Applicant had heard from his spouse through her sister that \nhis brother-in-law moved to another city after the change in administration. (Tr. 64-65, \n78.) Applicant had in-person contact with this brother-in-law at family functions, about two \nor three times total when Applicant lived in Kyrgyzstan, and during his trips to the country \nin 2014 and 2015. This brother-in-law does not speak English, so Applicant relied on his \nwife, his stepdaughter, or one of his wife\u2019s sisters to interpret. This brother-in-law knows \nthat Applicant was in the U.S. military and also that he had worked in a U.S. embassy. \nApplicant does not believe that his stepdaughter had any contact with brother-in-law X \nwhile she was attending college in Kyrgyzstan because brother-in-law X is \u201cestranged to \nour family.\u201d After his spouse left her previous husband, she lived in an apartment owned \nby brother-in-law X, and he threw her out when she had two young children to support \nand no income. As the senior member of Applicant\u2019s spouse\u2019s siblings, he wanted to \ndirect her life. (Tr. 67-68, 75.) Applicant believes his spouse had no current \ncorrespondence with this brother. Applicant has told his spouse that her brother\u2019s \noccupation could impact his clearance. (Tr. 79.) \n \nAs for any other family members or friends in the Kyrgyz Republic with whom his \nspouse maintains contact more often than every few years, Applicant responded that his \nspouse \u201cmight contact her older sister.\u201d (Tr. 72.) As to whether Applicant had in-person \ncontact with his spouse\u2019s siblings during the family gatherings in Kyrgyzstan, he \nresponded that he saw some of them (\u201cI mean, it\u2019s a hit or miss kind of thing. It depends \non what the gathering is or where it is.\u201d). (Tr. 73.)   \n \nApplicant asserts that he would immediately report if he was approached for any \nclassified or sensitive information. He has discussed with his spouse that he would have \n\n \n \n8 \nto report if someone attempted to use her family in Kyrgyzstan because he does not want \nto risk jeopardizing their sons and daughter\u2019s future. (Tr. 69-70.) Applicant and his spouse \nintend to raise their sons in the United States. They plan to have their younger son \nbaptized in the United States. (AE G.) \n \nAs of November 2018, Applicant\u2019s spouse did not work outside the home. She had \nworked in retail in the United States for one year. (Tr. 54.) Applicant\u2019s annual salary with \na defense contractor was $124,000 although it was soon to be increased to $138,000. \n(Tr. 48.) In addition to the $65,000 in equity in their home, Applicant had $60,000 in 401(k) \nassets and $15,000 in combined checking and savings deposits. (Tr. 59-60.) \n \nAdministrative Notice \n \nThe Kyrgyz Republic (or Kyrgyzstan) is a landlocked, mountainous Central Asian \ncountry that became a Soviet republic in 1936. It achieved independence on August 31, \n1991, when the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics dissolved. Predominantly rural and \nMuslim, the country has a population of 5.8 million, of which 73.2% are native Kyrgyz. A \nparliamentary republic, it is governed by an elected president as head of state; by an \nappointed prime minister as head of the government; and by a Supreme Council of 120 \nseats. The president holds substantial powers even though the prime minister oversees \nthe Kyrgyz government and selects most cabinet members. The president represents the \ncountry internationally and can sign or veto laws, call for new elections, and nominate \nSupreme Court judges, cabinet members for posts related to security or defense, and \nnumerous other high-level positions. \n \nNationwide protests because of violations in parliamentary elections led to the \noverthrow of the country\u2019s first president in March 2005. Under a new president elected \nin July 2005, the Kyrgyz Republic made tangible progress towards meeting international \nstandards. The country\u2019s human rights record improved considerably, although limitations \non due process and other human rights problems persisted. Following a week of \nopposition-led street protests, the country adopted a new constitution on November 9, \n2006, which provided for greater checks and balances among the branches of \ngovernment. On December 30, 2006, the parliament adopted a revised version of the \nconstitution that restored many powers to the president but also a greater role for political \nparties. \n \nOn April 7, 2010, the Kyrgyz Republic had a violent change of government and \napproved a new constitution and a temporary president in a June 27 national referendum. \nOctober 10, 2010 parliamentary elections were generally free and fair, and Almazbek \nAtambaev was sworn in as president in 2011. On October 15, 2017, former prime minister \nand ruling Social-Democratic Party of Kyrgyzstan member Sooronbai Jeenbekov was \nelected to succeed outgoing president Atambaev, who became the first Kyrgyz president \nto step down after serving one full six-year term as required in the country\u2019s constitution. \nKyrgyzstan's 2017 presidential election marked the first peaceful transfer of presidential \npower from one democratically-elected president to another in post-Soviet Central Asia. \nIt was the most competitive in the country\u2019s history, although international and local \n\n \n \n9 \nelection observers noted cases of vote buying and misuse of public resources. Prime \nminister Abyl-Gaziev took office on April 20, 2018 \n \nFollowing independence, Kyrgyzstan rapidly implemented market reforms, such \nas improving the regulatory system and instituting land reform. In 1998, Kyrgyzstan was \nthe first Commonwealth of Independent States country to be accepted into the World \nTrade Organization. The government has privatized much of its ownership shares \nin public enterprises. Significant impediments to Kyrgyzstan's development include \nendemic corruption, aging infrastructure, high unemployment, and endemic poverty. \n \nThe United States established diplomatic relations with the Kyrgyz Republic on \nDecember 25, 1991, following the country\u2019s independence from the Soviet Union. The \nUnited States supports the Kyrgyz Republic in its development of an inclusive democracy \nbased upon the rule of law and respect for human rights. U.S. Government assistance \ngoals in Kyrgyzstan are to strengthen democratic institutions, support broad-based \neconomic opportunity, enhance regional security, promote greater respect for human \nrights and the rule of law, and address development challenges in health and education. \nThe Kyrgyz Republic and the United States belong to a number of the same international \norganizations, including the United Nations, Euro-Atlantic Partnership Council, \nOrganization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, International Monetary Fund, World \nBank, and World Trade Organization. Kyrgyzstan also is a participant in the North Atlantic \nTreaty Organization's (NATO) Partnership for Peace program. The Kyrgyz Republic and \nthe United States have a bilateral trade agreement. The Kyrgyz Republic also signed a \ntrade and investment framework agreement with the United States and other Central \nAsian countries establishing a regional forum for addressing trade issues and enhancing \ntrade and investment between the United States and Central Asia. \n \nAt the same time, Manas Air Base in the Kyrgyz Republic, which had served as a \ntransit and logistics base for U.S. troops heading to Afghanistan, was turned over to the \nKyrgyz military in June 2014 after Kyrgyz\u2019s parliament passed legislation to end the U.S.\u2019 \nlease on the base. As of February 2018, the U.S. Defense Department was concerned \nabout Russian influence in Central Asia and the Kyrgyz Republic\u2019s increasing alliance \nwith Russia and China.6 \n \n                                                 \n6 Pursuant to my obligation to take administrative notice of the most current political conditions in evaluating \nGuideline B concerns (see ISCR Case No. 05-11292 (App. Bd. Apr. 12, 2007)), I note that at a hearing \nbefore the U.S. House Armed Services Committee held on February 27, 2018, the Commander of the U.S. \nCentral Command stated, in part: \n \nThe Kyrgyz Republic has increasingly aligned its interests with Russia and China. The \nU.S.-Kyrgyz security relationship has declined since the closure of the Manas Transit \nCenter and the termination of the bilateral Defense Cooperation Agreement in 2014. \nDespite the Kyrgyz armed forces\u2019 desire to improve military-to-military cooperation with \nCENTCOM, Kyrgyz senior civilian leaders have shown little interest in improving military \nrelations. \n \nSee www.centcom.mil/ABOUT--US/POSTURE--STATEMENT/ \n\n \n \n10 \nThe Kyrgyz Republic benefits from a robust civil society, and the government \ngenerally respects laws providing for the freedoms of peaceful assembly and association, \ninternal movement, foreign travel, and emigration and repatriation. Continuing concerns \nfor the country include the trajectory of democratization; endemic corruption; a history of \ntense, at times violent, inter-ethnic relations; border security vulnerabilities; and potential \nterrorist threats. \n  \nEthnic, political, and socio-economic tensions continue to simmer in the Kyrgyz \nRepublic. During 2016, Kyrgyzstan remained vulnerable to transnational threats, \nespecially in the remote south. The U.S. Embassy reviews travel of Embassy employees \nto Batken Oblast because ill-defined and porous borders allow for the relatively free \nmovement of people and illicit goods, rendering the region vulnerable to transnational \nthreats and could facilitate the establishment of terrorist safe havens. Rugged terrain and \na lack of resources prevent authorities from adequately controlling the borders. Lack of \neconomic opportunity was identified as a significant driver of violent extremism in the \ncountry, which forces a large portion of the population to seek employment opportunities \nin Russia, where they are particularly susceptible to recruitment. \n \nOn August 30, 2016 a vehicle-borne explosive device was detonated at the \nChinese Embassy located less than 300 meters from the U.S. Embassy in Bishkek, \nKyrgyzstan\u2019s capital city. Kyrgyz police located and detonated several explosive devices \nnear downtown Bishkek in September 2016 and have since made several terrorism-\nrelated arrests throughout the Kyrgyz Republic. Areas along the Kyrgyz-Uzbek and \nKyrgyz-Tajik borders continue to have small, but sometimes violent and deadly, \nskirmishes between border guards on both sides, which have affected civilians. These \nskirmishes often result from land use disputes. Organized crime related to smuggling and \nnarcotics trafficking are widespread in the southern corridors of the Kyrgyz Republic. Due \nto the exit of Coalition Forces from Afghanistan in 2014, the Kyrgyz government is \nconcerned that terrorist and extremist groups may move north into Tajikistan and \nKyrgyzstan. \n \nAs of March 2018, the U.S. State Department\u2019s Bureau of Diplomatic Security \nassessed Bishkek as a high-threat location for crime and political violence and as a \nmedium-threat location for terrorist activity directed at or affecting official U.S. government \ninterests. U.S. citizens visiting the country have been robbed by groups of young men \nwho followed them back to their residences from hotels and bars. In addition, U.S. citizens \nhave been victims of rape, assault, sexual harassment and kidnapping. Attackers do not \nalways avoid violent confrontation with their victims. Harassment and extortion by people \nwho purport to be Kyrgyz police officers has happened in local markets and in areas \nfrequented by Westerners. Even so, the State Department\u2019s travel advisory to the Kyrgyz \nRepublic as of April 24, 2018, was Level I: Exercise Normal Precautions. \n \nSignificant human rights issues persisted in the Kyrgyz Republic in 2017 involving \nlaw enforcement and security services officers\u2019 use of torture and arbitrary arrest; \nincreasing pressure on independent media; harassment of journalists; selective and \npolitically motivated prosecutions; pervasive corruption; forced labor; and attacks, threats, \n\n \n \n11 \nand systematic police-driven extortion of sexual and ethnic minority groups. Official \nimpunity was a significant problem. While authorities investigated reports of official abuse \nin the security services and elsewhere, they rarely prosecuted and punished officials \naccused of human rights violations, or complicity in trafficking. While the law provides for \nan independent judiciary, judges were subject to influence or corruption. Throughout the \nyear there were multiple instances where the conduct and outcomes of trials appeared \npredetermined. Numerous sources, including non-governmental organizations (NGOs), \nattorneys, government officials, and private citizens, asserted judges paid bribes to attain \ntheir positions. Many attorneys asserted that bribe taking was ubiquitous among judges. \nAuthorities generally respected court orders. Numerous NGOs described pervasive \nviolations of the right to a fair trial, including coerced confessions, use of torture, denial of \naccess to counsel, and convictions in the absence of sufficiently conclusive evidence or \ndespite exculpatory evidence. International observers reported threats and acts of \nviolence against defendants and defense attorneys within and outside the courtroom, as \nwell as intimidation of trial judges by victims\u2019 relatives and friends. Law enforcement \nofficers, particularly in the southern part of the country, frequently employed arbitrary \narrest, torture, and the threat of criminal prosecution as a means of extorting cash \npayments from citizens. \n \nKyrgyz law provides for freedom of expression, including for members of the press, \nand citizens generally were free to exercise these rights. NGO leaders and media rights \nadvocates, however, asserted the situation worsened during the year, highlighting the \nincrease in libel lawsuits against independent media outlets and journalists and forced \nclosure of news agencies. Self-censorship was prevalent, and some journalists reported \npressure from editors and political figures to bias their reporting on sensitive topics. Some \njournalists reported intimidation related to coverage of sensitive topics, such as inter-\nethnic relations, \u201creligious extremism,\u201d or the rise of nationalism. In recent years there \nwere attempts to proscribe independent media from operating freely in the country. Tight \ngovernment controls over news content on state television was widely acknowledged. \nMedia rights advocates noted increasing pressure on media outlets in advance of the \n2017 October presidential election. The Kyrgyz government failed to enforce laws against \nrape effectively, and rape cases were underreported. Police generally regarded spousal \nrape as an administrative, rather than a criminal, offense. While the law specifically \nprohibits domestic violence and spousal abuse, violence against women and girls \nremained a significant yet underreported problem. \n \n \nThe CSCE estimated in August 2017 that 12,000 young women in the Kyrgyz \nRepublic are kidnapped and forced to marry their abductors. Although illegal since 1994, \n\u201cbride kidnapping\u201d is socially accepted as a Kyrgyz tradition and is often justified by the \nperpetrator on that basis. According to the CSCE, in Kyrgyz society, particularly in the \nrural areas, an unmarried woman\u2019s reputation can be irrevocably damaged if she spends \neven a single night outside her family home so she may feel she has no recourse other \nthan to consent to the marriage. The CSCE attributes the practice to Kyrgyz assertion of \nethnicity and tradition as a way to distance themselves from their Soviet past and affirm \nthe country\u2019s independent identity (ethic nationalism). As a participating state of the Office \nof Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), the Kyrgyz Republic is a party to several \n\n \n \n12 \nOSCE commitments to gender equality and is making efforts to end the practice of bride \nkidnapping. In 2013, the penalty for bride kidnapping was increased from three to seven \nyears in prison. In 2016, a new law was enacted against underage marriages and forced \nmarriages that holds accountable those who perform them and the relatives who \nparticipate in organizing them. \n \nPolicies \n \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion the Executive \nBranch has in regulating access to information pertaining to national security,  \nemphasizing that \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy \nv. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). When evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security \nclearance, the administrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are required to be \nconsidered in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of \nhuman behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the \nadjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overall adjudicative goal is a fair, \nimpartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a \nconscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d \nThe administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the \nperson, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present \nevidence to establish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, \nthe applicant is responsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, \nexplain, extenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department \nCounsel. . . .\u201d The applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable \nsecurity decision. \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation about potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Section 7 of EO 10865 \nprovides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be \na determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section \n3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information). \n\n \n \n13 \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline B: Foreign Influence \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for foreign influence is articulated in \nAG \u00b6 6: \n \nForeign contacts and interests, including but not limited to, business, \nfinancial, and property interests, are a national security concern if they result \nin divided allegiance. They may also be a national security concern if they \ncreate circumstances in which the individual may be manipulated or induced \nto help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a way that \nis inconsistent with U.S. interests or otherwise made vulnerable to pressure \nor coercion by any foreign interest. Assessment of foreign contacts and \ninterests should consider the country in which the foreign contact or interest \nis located, including, but not limited to, considerations such as whether it is \nknown to target U.S. citizens to obtain classified or sensitive information or \nis associated with a risk of terrorism. \n \nApplicant has familial ties through marriage to the Kyrgyz Republic that raise \nforeign influence security concerns. Applicant\u2019s spouse is a native of the Kyrgyz Republic \nwho became a U.S. permanent resident in October 2014, moved to the United States in \nSeptember 2015, and became a naturalized U.S. citizen in June 2018. Her daughter, now \nage 23, has been a citizen of Kyrgyzstan since birth. She acquired her U.S. green card in \nOctober 2014, but attended college in Kyrgyzstan and so has lived continuously in the \nUnited States only since June 2017. Applicant\u2019s spouse\u2019s father and six of her siblings \nare currently residents of Kyrgyzstan. Five if not all six of those siblings are citizens of \nKyrgyzstan. One of her brothers with Kyrgyz residency and citizenship began working for \nthe Kyrgyz government on his graduation from college. As of Applicant\u2019s OPM interview \nin August 2016, this brother-in-law was an intelligence official. Applicant has heard that \nhis brother-in-law was removed from his position with the change in government in \nOctober 2017, but he does not know for certain. \n \n  Review of Applicant\u2019s contacts and connections to these foreign citizens through \nmarriage is warranted to determine whether they present a heightened risk under AG \u00b6 \n7(a) or AG \u00b6 7(e) or create a potential conflict of interest under AG \u00b6 7(b). Those \ndisqualifying conditions provide: \n \n(a) contact, regardless of method, with a foreign family member, business \nor professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or \nresident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of \nforeign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; \n \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual\u2019s obligation to \n\n \n \n14 \nprotect classified or sensitive information or technology and the individual\u2019s \ndesire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing that \ninformation or technology; and \n \n(e) sharing living quarters with a person or persons, regardless of \ncitizenship status, if that relationship creates a heightened risk of foreign \ninducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion. \n \nNot every foreign contact or tie presents the heightened risk under AG \u00b6 7(a). The \n\u201cheightened risk\u201d denotes a risk greater than the normal risk inherent in having a family \nmember living under a foreign government. The nature and strength of the family ties or \nother foreign interests and the country involved (i.e., the nature of its government, its \nrelationship with the United States, and its human rights record) are relevant in assessing \nwhether there is a likelihood of vulnerability to government coercion. The risk of coercion, \npersuasion, or duress is significantly greater if the foreign country has an authoritarian \ngovernment; a family member is associated with, or dependent on, the foreign \ngovernment; or the country is known to conduct intelligence operations against the United \nStates. In considering the nature of the foreign government, the administrative judge must \ntake into account any terrorist activity in the country at issue. See generally ISCR Case \nNo. 02-26130 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 7, 2006). \n \nApplicant has bonds of affection and obligation to his spouse, who now enjoys the \nprotections of U.S. citizenship and residency, and to his stepdaughter, who is a U.S. legal \npermanent resident with Kyrgyz citizenship. There is also a rebuttable presumption that \na person has ties of affection for, or obligation to, the immediate family members of his or \nher spouse. See e.g., ISCR Case No. 11-12659 (App. Bd. May 30, 2013). Applicant \nindicated on his SF 86 that his only contact with his father-in-law was in person, once \nannually. However, Applicant\u2019s spouse is in monthly contact with her father. Applicant \nindicated on his SF 86 that he has quarterly contact with her brother who was then a fraud \ninvestigator in Kyrgyzstan. He testified that his spouse has monthly contact with her \nbrother and that she also has some contact with an older sister in Kyrgyzstan. Little \ninformation was provided about that sister, who was not listed by Applicant on his SF 86 \nor discussed during his interview. Applicant and his spouse suggested that they are \nsomewhat estranged from some of her family members in Kyrgyzstan, particularly from \nher brother (brother-in-law X) employed by the Kyrgyz government for most, if not all, of \nhis career. However, the evidence shows that Applicant and his spouse got together with \nher family, including brother-in-law X, during family events when they lived in Kyrgyzstan \nuntil May 2012, and during trips to Kyrgyz for family visits and reunions in March 2014, \nJuly 2015, and October 2015. She traveled to Kyrgyz early to have more time with her \nfamily. \n \nThe Kyrgyz Republic and the United States have good relations, although the DOD \nis concerned about growing Russian influence in the region and the decline in the security \nrelationship between the Kyrgyz Republic and the United States. With its mixed human \nrights record and brother-in-law X\u2019s longtime career in intelligence for Kyrgyzstan, there \nis a heightened risk of undue foreign influence.  AG \u00b6\u00b6 7(a) and 7(b) are established. \n\n \n \n15 \nApplicant\u2019s spouse had owned an apartment in Kyrgyzstan that she purchased for \n$45,000 in April 2012. Although not significant to Applicant in terms of his overall financial \nsituation, it was important to his stepdaughter because it was her residence while \nattending college. Given that the property was sold in June 2017 and the sales proceeds \nwere wired to the United States well before the SOR was issued, AG \u00b6 7(f) is not \nestablished.7  \n \nThe burden shifts to Applicant to mitigate the risk of undue foreign influence that \nexists because of his familial ties through marriage to Kyrgyzstan, a former member state \nof the USSR that continues to align its interests to some extent with Russia, a country \nknown to target the United States and its citizens for sensitive and classified information. \nAG \u00b6 8(a) provides for mitigation as follows: \n \n(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in which \nthese persons are located, or the positions or activities of those persons in \nthat country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be placed in a \nposition of having to choose between the interests of a foreign individual, \ngroup, organization, or government and the interests of the United States.  \n \nThere is no evidence that Applicant\u2019s spouse\u2019s family members in the Kyrgyz \nRepublic have attempted to obtain classified or sensitive information from Applicant. Even \nso, AG \u00b6 8(a) is difficult to apply based on what is known about his spouse\u2019s siblings in \nKyrgyzstan. Applicant\u2019s spouse and the older of her siblings, if not all of them, were raised \nin Kyrgyzstan when it was part of the USSR. They were taught Russian under a Soviet \nsystem which emphasized education, and they all had advanced schooling. They speak \nKyrgyz and Russian, and it is unclear whether they have fully embraced democratic \ninstitutions and proclivities. Apparently only one of her sisters knows English. Her oldest \nbrother, who was described by Applicant as the head of the family, spent his career in \nintelligence for the Kyrgyz government. Even if her brother was removed from his position \non the change of administrations in October 2017, his past employment presents a risk \nthat Applicant will be placed in the untenable position of having to choose between the \ninterests of his spouse or those of her family members with Kyrgyz citizenship or \nresidency with whom she has ongoing relations.  \n  \nThere is no evidence that Applicant has any loyalty or affiliation to the Kyrgyz \nRepublic or its institutions, but it is difficult to conclude that the bonds of affection or \nobligation to his spouse and her immediate family members, including her daughter and \nfather, are so minimal to satisfy the first part of AG \u00b6 8(b), which provides: \n \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of \nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, group, government, or country is \nso minimal, or the individual has such deep and longstanding relationships \n                                                 \n7 AG \u00b6 7(f) applies when there is a \u201csubstantial business, financial, or property interests in a foreign country, \nor in any foreign owned or foreign-operated business that could subject the individual to a heightened risk \nof foreign influence, or exploitation, or personal conflict of interest.\u201d \n \n\n \n \n16 \nand loyalties in the United States, that the individual can be expected to \nresolve any conflict of interest in favor of the U.S. interest. \n \nApplicant\u2019s relationships and loyalties in the United States may still be so deep and \nlongstanding that he can be counted on to resolve any conflict in favor of the U.S. interest. \nIn that regard, he is a native U.S. citizen who served honorably on active duty and in the \nreserves for the U.S. military. His three sons are U.S. citizens and reside in the United \nStates. Applicant owns property in the United States, and his employment is in the United \nStates. He held clearances over the years with no evidence of any security infractions or \nviolations. He has no foreign assets. His spouse intends to reside permanently in the \nUnited States, and as evidence of her intention in that regard, she became a U.S. citizen. \nHer daughter now lives and works in the United States and intends to apply for U.S. \ncitizenship at her first opportunity. While AG \u00b6 8(b) has some applicability, I am concerned \nabout the fact that Applicant\u2019s brother-in-law X knows that Applicant served in the U.S. \nmilitary and worked for the United States government at an embassy. Applicant admitted \nthat there is no way to know whether his brother-in-law\u2019s employment with the Kyrgyz \ngovernment has ended. \n \nApplicant testified that he will immediately report any efforts to approach or \ninfluence him by or through foreign sources, including his spouse\u2019s relatives. Some \nconcern arises that he may not recognize or report an improper contact. If Applicant\u2019s \ntestimony is credible, he has made little effort to inform himself of even basic information \nabout his spouse\u2019s relatives and their activities. It could be said that he minimizes his risk \nby knowing little. At the same time, he has the burden of mitigation to address the foreign \ninfluence security concerns, and he did not show himself to be fully forthcoming about the \nextent of his spouse\u2019s foreign ties to Kyrgyzstan. The Government was not aware before \nApplicant\u2019s hearing that his spouse has two sisters and four brothers in the Kyrgyz \nRepublic. Conceivably, Kyrgyz authorities could bring some pressure on his spouse\u2019s \nfamily members to gain influence or information from Applicant. People act in \nunpredictable ways when faced with choices that could be important to a family member.8 \n \nThere is nothing untoward in the record about Applicant\u2019s relationships and \ncontacts with his spouse\u2019s family members in Kyrgyzstan. AG \u00b6 8(c), \u201ccontact or \ncommunication with foreign citizens is so casual and infrequent that there is little \nlikelihood that it could create a risk for foreign influence or exploitation,\u201d has limited \napplicability nonetheless, given the evidence of ongoing contact his spouse has with her \nfather and some of her siblings. The foreign influence security concerns are not fully \nmitigated. \n \n \n                                                 \n8 As stated by the DOHA Appeal Board in ISCR Case No. 08-10025 (App. Bd. Nov. 3, 2009), \u201cApplication \nof the guidelines is not a comment on an applicant\u2019s patriotism but merely an acknowledgment that people \nmay act in unpredictable ways when faced with choices that could be important to a loved-one, such as a \nfamily member.\u201d \n\n \n \n17 \nWhole-Person Concept \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of his conduct and \nall relevant circumstances in light of the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 \n2(d).9 Furthermore, in weighing these whole-person factors in a foreign influence case, \nthe Appeal Board has held that: \n \nEvidence of good character and personal integrity is relevant and material \nunder the whole person concept. However, a finding that an applicant \npossesses good character and integrity does not preclude the government \nfrom considering whether the applicant's facts and circumstances still pose \na security risk. Stated otherwise, the government need not prove that an \napplicant is a bad person before it can deny or revoke access to classified \ninformation. Even good people can pose a security risk because of facts \nand circumstances not under their control. See ISCR Case No. 01-26893 \n(App. Bd. Oct. 16, 2002). \n \nAlthough Applicant\u2019s spouse is now a U.S. citizen, she has lived in the United \nStates only since September 2015. She and Applicant traveled to the Kyrgyz Republic for \na family reunion in October 2015, and she is not estranged from some close family \nmembers.  Perhaps at some future date, Applicant\u2019s family situation may present less of \na risk. At this time, I am unable to conclude that it is clearly consistent with the national \ninterest to grant security clearance eligibility for Applicant. \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline B:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.b:  \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.c-1.d: \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.e:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n                                                 \n9 The factors under AG \u00b6 2(a) are as follows: \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding \nthe conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the \nconduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other \npermanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for \npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or \nrecurrence. \n \n\n \n \n18 \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances, it is not clearly consistent with the national \ninterest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security clearance.

Dorsey, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro Se\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nMETZ, John Grattan, Jr., Administrative Judge:\nBased on the record in this case,  I deny Applicant\u2019s clearance.\n1\nOn 31 January 2017, the Department of Defense (DoD) sent Applicant a\nStatement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security concerns under Guideline F, Financial\nConsiderations.  Applicant timely answered the SOR, requesting a hearing before the\n2\nDefense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA). DOHA assigned the case to me 26\nConsisting of the transcript (Tr.), Government exhibits (GE) 1-4, hearing exhibit (HE) I, and Applicant Exhibits\n1\n(AE) A-I. AE I was timely received post hearing. The record in this case closed 9 January 2018, when\nDepartment Counsel noted no objection to AE I.\nDoD acted under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information Within Industry (February 20,\n2\n1960), as amended; DoD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program\n(January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) effective within the DoD on\n1 September 2006. However, on 10 December 2016, the Director of National Intelligence (DNI) signed\nSecurity Executive Agent Directive 4, implementing new AG, effective with any decision issued on or after 8\nJune 2017. My decision is the same under both guidelines.\n1\n01/17/2019\n\nSeptember 2017 and I convened a hearing 20 December 2017. DOHA received the\ntranscript 2 January 2018.\nFindings of Fact\nApplicant admitted the SOR allegations, except SOR 1.i. He is a 30-year-old call\ncenter analyst employed by a U.S. defense contractor since December 2016.  He was  \n3\nemployed in less-well-paid positions since March 2004. He has previously had a\nfavorable background investigation in November 2007, when he worked for the\nGovernment. This is a periodic reinvestigation of that clearance (GE 1).\nThe SOR alleges, Government exhibits substantiate, and Applicant admits 22\ndelinquent debts totaling over $35,000. The debts comprise $2,300 in delinquent traffic\ntickets (SOR 1.k-1.v), four delinquent education loans totaling $23,051, and six\ncommercial credit accounts. SOR 1.i appears as a current account in Applicant\u2019s April\n2014 credit report (GE 4) with a $335 balance; Applicant\u2019s November 2016 credit report\n(GE 3) reports that the account was charged off and transferred to another lender, but\nwith no stated balance.4\nApplicant reported five delinquent debts on his April 2014 clearance application\n(GE 1), including SOR 1.c, 1.e, 1.j, and 1.w. At the time, he claimed to have been\nmaking payments on SOR 1.c, and to have made payment arrangements with the other\ncreditors. He discussed these debts, and was confronted with the remaining SOR debts,\nduring a May 2014 interview with a Government investigator (GE 2), based on his April\n2014 credit report (GE 4). He repeated his claimed payments on SOR 1.c, and stated\nhis willingness and ability to address the SOR debts. In his Answer, Applicant claimed to\nbe working with a financial planner to address SOR 1.a, 1.b, 1.d, and 1.j. He claimed to\nbe paying on SOR 1.g and 1.h, to have made a payment plan on SOR 1.c and 1.f, and\nto be in the process of contacting the SOR 1.e creditor. Except as noted below,\nApplicant has corroborated none of these claims.\nApplicant began a new repayment plan on SOR debt 1.c in February 2017, and\nis current on his payments through December 2017 (AE A). SOR debts 1.e and 1.f are\nto the same original creditor, with 1.f being held by a collection agent. The accounts\nhave different account numbers, so I cannot determine that the accounts are the same.\nApplicant claims to be making payments on 1.f, but the credit reports do not appear to\nconfirm that, and Applicant provided no corroboration. Similarly, Applicant claimed to be\nmaking payments on SOR debts 1.g, 1.h, and 1.w, but provided no corroboration. He\nclaimed (Tr. 25, 27) that he had disputed or paid the traffic tickets (SOR 1.k-1.v), but\nThis is a different contractor than originally sponsored his April 2014 clearance applicantion. At that time, he\n3\nwas employed at a lower wage than currently, and had been briefly unemployed from October to December\n2012. He was also unemployed from May to November 2016 (Tr. 29), during which time he drew\nunemployment.\nApplicant claimed that the account was paid (Answer), but provided no documentation. Applicant\u2019s December\n4\n2017 credit report (AE E).shows the account closed in September 2014.\n2\n\nprovided no documentation aside from the fact that the tickets do not appear on his\nDecember 2017 credit report (AE E).  The education loan at SOR 1.j was satisfied with\n5\na final payment in January 2018 (AE I).6\nFederally guaranteed student loans are difficult to track through credit reports\nbecause of the way the loans are issued, defaulted, consolidated, and rehabilitated, \nseldom with the same account numbers attached to the accounts. Applicant\u2019s April 2014\ncredit report shows six education loans, with complete account numbers, issued by the\ncreditor at SOR 1.a, 1.b, and 1.d. The entries report only the original loan amounts \nbecause each of the accounts was 120-days past due, and had been transferred to\nanother office. However, those original loan amounts correspond exactly to the six loans\nthat have been consolidated on Applicant\u2019s December 2017 account statement from the\nrehabilitation collection agent (AE B). The statement reflects no past-due amounts, and\nan upcoming $5.00 payment.  These six loans cannot be tracked through the\n7\nApplicant\u2019s November 2016 credit report (from which SOR 1.a, 1.b,  and 1.d are taken)\nbecause that credit report uses only the first four digits of the account number, which is\nthe same for all three accounts, bears no correlation to the original account numbers,\nand are the same original loan amounts\u2014only one of which matches an original loan\namount in AE B. Nevertheless, I conclude that six loans listed in AE B cover the SOR\namounts alleged in 1.a, 1.b, and 1.d.\nApplicant attributed his financial problems to his ignoring his financial obligations\nfor many years (Tr. 24). He particularly ignored his education loans, but was generally\nnot paying attention to his finances (Tr. 48-49). He did not begin to systematically\naddress his debts until after he received the SOR (Tr. 24, 69). He claims that he has\nbeen working hard on his credit since then (Tr. 26, 60).\nApplicant documented no credit or financial counseling, and did not submit a\nbudget, although he claimed to have one (Tr. 60). He claimed (Tr. 69) to have briefly\nlooked into credit counseling in February 2017, but did not really work with them. He\nclaimed to have worked with a credit repair company (Tr. 29) but had no documentation.\nThroughout his hearing, he claimed to have paid debts, or be paying debts, that he had\nSeveral of the SOR debts are still reported delinquent on this credit report. There are also new delinquent\n5\ndebts, which Applicant acknowledges (Tr. 57-58). I have not considered these debts on the merits of the case,\nbut they are relevant to show Applicant\u2019s state of mind.\nThe account number in AE I matches that on GE 3. Given the amount of the debt as of November 2016, I\n6\ninfer that Applicant was making payments on this account before the SOR was issued.\nWhen loans are placed in rehabilitation, the lender sets an arbitrarily-low monthly payment to ensure that the\n7\nloans can be successfully rehabilitated before the account is transferred to the collection agent\u2014with a\nsubstantially higher monthly payment. In this case, when he first contacted the creditor in February 2017, the\naccount was transferred to a rehabilitation collection agent, where Applicant made $5 monthly payments from\napproximately February to November 2017 (Tr. 45-46; 61). The account was then sent to a second\nrehabilitation collection agent (AE B), where the required $5 payment for December is the first of three $5\npayments required before the loans are sent to the permanent servicer, where the monthly payment is\nexpected to be $206 (Tr. 61-65).\n3\n\nreceipts for, but he never submitted them. Applicant\u2019s fiancee is somewhat aware of the\nSOR, and says Applicant is working on his financial problems. They share expenses\n(Tr. 80-85). Applicant claims $1,000 monthly positive case flow (Tr. 43). He provided no\nwork or character references, or evidence of community involvement.\nPolicies\nThe adjudicative guidelines (AG) list factors for evaluating a person\u2019s suitability\nfor access to classified information. Administrative judges must assess disqualifying and\nmitigating conditions under each issue fairly raised by the facts and situation presented.\nEach decision must also reflect a fair, impartial, and commonsense consideration of the\nfactors listed in AG \u00b6 2(a). Any one disqualifying or mitigating condition is not, by itself,\nconclusive. However, specific adjudicative guidelines should be followed where a case\ncan be measured against them, as they represent policy guidance governing access to\nclassified information. Considering the SOR allegations and the evidence as a whole,\nthe relevant adjudicative guideline is Guideline F (Financial Considerations).\nSecurity clearance decisions resolve whether it is clearly consistent with the\nnational interest to grant or continue an applicant\u2019s security clearance. The Government\nmust prove, by substantial evidence, controverted facts alleged in the SOR. If it does, \nthe burden shifts to applicant to refute, extenuate, or mitigate the Government\u2019s case.\nBecause no one has a right to a security clearance, the applicant bears a heavy burden\nof persuasion.\nPersons with access to classified information enter into a fiduciary relationship\nwith the Government based on trust and confidence. Therefore, the Government has a\ncompelling interest in ensuring each applicant possesses the requisite judgement,\nreliability, and trustworthiness of those who must protect national interests as their own.\nThe \u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d standard compels resolution of any\nreasonable doubt about an applicant\u2019s suitability for access in favor of the Government.8\nAnalysis\nThe Government established a case for disqualification under Guideline F, and\nApplicant failed to mitigate the security concerns. Applicant accumulated significant\ndelinquent debt, including Federally-guaranteed education loans, and largely ignored his\nfinancial obligations until after he received the SOR, despite having discussed these\ndebts with a Government investigator in May 2014.9\nSee, Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518 (1988).\n8\n\u00b619(a) inability to satisfy debts; (b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so; (c) a history\n9\nof not meeting financial obligations;\n4\n\nApplicant meets none of the mitigating conditions for financial considerations.\nThe conduct was recent, frequent, and the circumstances were not unusual.10\nMoreover, the circumstances of his financial problems were certainly within his control,\nand he was irresponsible in addressing his debts until after he received the SOR.11\n \nApplicant has neither claimed nor documented any credit or financial counseling,\nand there is a dearth of evidence to show that his financial problems have been\nresolved or are under control.  This failure of evidence precludes a conclusion that\n12\nApplicant has made a good-faith effort to address his debts.  The Government is not\n13\nthe collection agent of last resort. Applicants are expected to meet their financial\nobligations for moral reasons and legal requirements. Applicant\u2019s belated efforts to\naddress his education loans have reached the point where he is on the cusp of regular\npayments, but he has no established track record of payments. The few months of $5\npayments are not sufficient. With the possible exception of SOR debts 1.i and 1.j, all of\nApplicant\u2019s efforts to address his debts were belated. Moreover, he submitted no work\nor character evidence which might support a whole-person assessment to overcome the\nsecurity concerns raised by his conduct. I conclude Guideline F against Applicant.\nFormal Findings\nParagraph 1. Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs a-h, k-w:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraphs i-j:\nFor Applicant\n\u00b620(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such circumstances that\n10\nit is unlikely to recur . . . \n\u00b620(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s control . . . and\n11\nthe individual acted responsibly under the circumstances;\n\u00b620(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem . . .  and there are clear indications\n12\nthat the problem is being resolved or is under control;\n\u00b620(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise\n13\nresolve debts.\n5\n\nConclusion\nUnder the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for\nApplicant.

Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access \nto classified information is denied.  \nStatement of the Case \nOn March 14, 2017, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications \nFacility (DoD CAF) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant, detailing the \nsecurity concerns under Guideline F, financial considerations, and Guideline B, foreign \n02/28/2019\n\n \n2 \ninfluence and explaining why it was unable to find it clearly consistent with the national \ninterest to grant or continue security clearance eligibility for him.1  \n \nOn April 5, 2017, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations and requested a \nhearing before an administrative judge from the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals \n(DOHA). On February 7, 2018, DOHA issued a Notice of Hearing scheduling a hearing \nthat was conducted on March 1, 2018. At the hearing, six Government exhibits (Ex. 1-6) \nand eight Applicant exhibits (Ex. A-H) were admitted into evidence without objection. The \nrecord was held open following the hearing to allow Applicant to submit additional \ndocuments should he chose to do so. Post-hearing documents were received and were \nadmitted into the record as Ex. K-U. Documents submitted by Applicant as attachments \nto his answer were considered. Applicant testified, as reflected in a transcript (Tr.) \nreceived on March 9, 2018. \n \nWhile this case was pending a decision, the Director of National Intelligence issued \nSecurity Executive Agent Directive 4, establishing the National Security Adjudicative \nGuidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information or Eligibility to \nHold a Sensitive Position (AGs), which he made applicable to all covered individuals who \nrequire initial or continued eligibility for access to classified information or eligibility to hold \na sensitive position. The new AGs supersede the Sept. 1, 2006 AGs and are effective \u201cfor \nall covered individuals\u201d on or after June 8, 2017. Accordingly, I have evaluated Applicant\u2019s \nsecurity clearance eligibility under the new AGs.2 \n \nProcedural Rulings \n \nA risk assessment in this case necessitates administrative notice of facts \nconcerning Cameroon. Administrative or official notice is the appropriate type of notice \nused for administrative proceedings. See ISCR Case No. 05-11292 at 4 n.1 (App. Bd. \nApr. 12, 2007); ISCR Case No. 02-24875 at 2 (App. Bd. Oct. 12, 2006) (citing ISCR Case \nNo. 02-18668 at 3 (App. Bd. Feb. 10, 2004) and McLeod v. Immigration and Naturalization  \nService, 802 F.2d 89, 93 n.4 (3d Cir. 1986)). Usually administrative notice at ISCR \nproceedings is accorded to facts that are either well known or from government reports.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nIn Applicant\u2019s answer to the SOR, he stated he was working to resolve the $10,928 \nautomobile loan (SOR 1.a) and $1,469 telephone service debt (SOR 1.b). He denied the \nremaining six delinquent accounts. He admitted he had relatives who were citizens and \n                                                          \n1 The DoD CAF took the action under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \nIndustry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DoD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security \nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the Adjudicative Guidelines for \nDetermining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information (AG) effective within the DoD on September 1, \n2006, for all adjudications for national security eligibility or eligibility to hold a sensitive position. \n \n2 Application of the AGs that were in effect as of the issuance of the SOR would not change my decision in \nthis case. The new AGs are available at http://ogc.osd.mil/doha/5220-6 R20170608.pdf. \n  \n\n \n3 \nresidents of Cameroon. After a thorough review of the pleadings, testimony, and exhibits, \nI make the following findings of fact. \nApplicant is a 40-year-old project specialist who has worked for a defense \ncontractor since September 2014.

In February 2000, Applicant \nvisited the United States when he came to the United States to further his education and \nto avoid violence and turmoil in Cameroon. (Tr. 31) At that time, Cameroon was politically \nunstable and had a high murder rate. (Ex. 3) He feared for his life in Cameroon and \napplied for political asylum in the United States. (Tr. 32) In 1997, he had been arrested \nfor protesting against the Cameroon government. (Tr. 33) His brother had also been \narrested. (Tr. 35) One of his cousins has been jailed indefinitely and Applicant has had \nfriends killed by the police. (Tr. 94) The government had been autonomous and a \ndictatorship. (Tr. 34) Cameroon has improved politically to the point Applicant visited \nCameroon for three weeks in 2013. That was his first visit since leaving the country in \n2000. (Ex. 3, Tr. 64) Cameroon does not accept dual citizenship. (Tr. 52)  \nApplicant\u2019s brother and his sister are Cameroon nationals. His other brother is a \nnaturalized U.S. citizen and lives with him. (Ex. 3, Ex. D, Tr. 20) A couple of months after \nApplicant arrived in the United States, his brother arrived and two years later, his other \nbrother and sister arrived. (Tr. 19) His siblings were granted political asylum. (Ex. 3) One \nbrother lives in Canada and is a Canadian permanent resident pending Canadian \ncitizenship. (Tr. 56) His sister, a cosmetologist, lives in Arkansas and is a U.S. registered \nalien pending her citizenship. (Ex. 1, Ex. 2, Tr. 20, Tr. 54) She cannot apply for citizenship \nuntil she has been a registered alien for five years. (Tr. 53) In 2012 and 2013, he traveled \nto Canada to visit his brother and in 2013, he visited his family in Cameroon, as previously \nstated.  \nIn June 2012, Applicant became a naturalized U.S. citizen. (Ex. 1, Ex. 2, Tr. 32) \nHe feels loyalty to the United States and has no divided loyalty. (Tr. 97) His wife is a \nCameroon national and has U.S. alien registration. (Ex. 3, Tr. 25) His wife was already \nliving in the United States when they met in 2011. She had been previously jailed in \nCameroon for political protesting and was granted political asylum in the United States. \n(Tr. 63) They met in March 2011 and married in November 2011. (Ex. 1, Ex. 2) (Ex. 3) He \nanticipates his wife will become a naturalized U.S. citizen in 2020. (Ex. 3, Ex. D) She is a \nbusiness analyst working for an insurance company. (Tr. 2, Tr. 59) His two children were \nboth born in the United States. (Tr. 59) His father-in-law is a Cameroon national, retired \nfrom the Cameroon railway services, and is now a fireman. (Ex. 1, Ex. 2, Tr. 60) Applicant \nhas contact with his father-in-law by telephone twice a month. (Tr. 61) His wife has two \nsiblings living in Cameroon and three living in the United States. (Tr. 62) The record is \nsilent as to Applicant\u2019s contact with these individuals. \n\n \n4 \nApplicant\u2019s mother and father are both Cameroon nationals and are retired civil \nservants. In her mid-30 to mid-40s, his mother worked ten years as a meteorologist for \nthe Cameroon government. (Ex. 2, Ex. 3, Tr. 45, Tr. 46) After retiring, she worked as a \nfinance manager for a private construction and security company and is now retired. (Ex. \n1, Ex. B, Tr. 25, Tr. 49) He has daily contact with her via email, text, or telephone calls \nwhen she is in Cameroon. (Ex. 3) She is currently visiting him in the United States. \nFor nine or ten years, Applicant\u2019s father, a Cameroon national, was one of thirteen \njustices on the Supreme Court of the Republic of Cameroon and, at one time, was \npresident of the high court.

His father served as a judge in Cameroon in various \npositions for 40 years. (Tr. 38) Applicant has contact with his father twice a week via \nemail, text, or telephone calls. (Ex. 3, Tr. 51) His parents receive pensions from the \nCameroon government. (Tr. 66)  \nApplicant\u2019s parents have decided not to move to the United States because they \nwould not be able to cope with the life style in the United States and because his father\u2019s \narthritis would make winters in the United States unbearable for him. (Tr. 43) Applicant \nwould consider the area they live in Cameroon to be \u201cvery dangerous.\u201d (Tr. 44) His mother \nvisits him in the United States every two years and is currently visiting him, as previously \nstated. (Ex. 3, Ex. I) In March 2017, he applied for U.S. alien registration for his mother. \n(Ex. I-2, Ex. I-3, Tr. 25, Tr. 51) With alien registration, an individual must live in the United \nStates six months out of the year, which is another reason he did not apply for alien \nregistration for his father. (Tr. 52)  \nThe SOR alleges Applicant has four charged-off accounts totaling $23,175, three \ncollection accounts totaling $14,847, and he was $16,599 past due on another account. \nThe delinquent obligations totaled $54,621. He alleges that after completing his MBA in \n2003 and after he purchased his home, he started receiving letters stating he had \npurchased various goods, which he had not purchased. (Tr. 22, 29) When he located to \na job on the other coast, the company reviewed his credit and he discovered many flags \non his credit report. (Tr. 22) He disputed some of the accounts and made payments on \nothers. (Tr. 22) In 2008 or 2009, Applicant asserts he was the victim of identity theft. (Ex. \n2) He now employs two different credit monitoring services, neither of which are credit \ncounseling services. (Ex. 2) The services are to notify him of any irregular activity, dispute \nfraudulent activity, and alert him if his credit is pulled. (Tr. 85) He has had the service for \ntwo years. (Ex. I, K) \nIn 2011, Applicant\u2019s wife became ill and stopped working. She has now returned \nto working. The home they own is located in another state and is rented to tenants. (Tr. \n67) As of June 2015, Applicant owed approximately $218,000 on investment real estate. \n                                                          \n3 Exhibit A, written in French and not translated, states Applicant\u2019s father was due to retire because he was \n65 years old. (Tr. 93) \n \n4 Two or three years ago, Cameroon established a constitutional court, which supersedes the Supreme \nCourt. (Tr. 37)  \n\n \n5 \n(Ex. 2) At the hearing, he asserted he owed $209,000 on the property that has a fair \nmarket value of $250,000. He has put down a deposit on a new home being built where \nthey currently live. (Ex. F, Tr. 67) The new home costs $460,000. (Tr. 69) He intends to \nkeep his rental home after buying his new home. (Tr. 92) \nThe automobile debt listed in listed in SOR 1.a ($10,928) appears on Applicant\u2019s \nJanuary 2015 credit report. (Ex. 4) A previous automobile loan with the same lender was \nlisted as \u201cPays as Agreed\u201d with a high credit amount of $26,276 and a current balance of \n$21,784. The auto loan obtained in June 2011 required monthly payments of $598 for 72 \nmonths. (Ex. 4) He had purchased a used BMW, which developed problems. He traded \nit in, and in September 2012, and purchased an Acura using the same creditor for the \nnew auto loan. (Ex. I-5, Tr. 24) \nIn April 2016, Applicant could no longer afford the monthly car payments. (Ex. 3) \nEven though he had not missed any payments on the loan, he called the bank and had \nhis car voluntarily repossessed. (Ex. 3) At the time of the repossession, Applicant \nasserted he owed $18,000 on the loan and the vehicle was sold for $11,000 following the \nrepossession. (Ex. 3) In his July 2016 enhanced subject interview, he said he was in the \nprocess of setting up a repayment plan with the bank. In his July 2017 SOR response, he \nstated he was working on a resolution of this debt. His November 2016 credit report lists \n$5,626 past due on a $10,928 balance (SOR 1.a). (Ex. 6) At the hearing, he said he was \nworking with the creditor to reach a settlement agreement on the debt. (Tr. 71) He was \nunsure when a settlement agreement would be reached. (Tr. 87) His May 2018 credit \nreport reflects $12,590 charged off as a bad debt. (Ex. I-5)  \nApplicant asserted he was unable to continue with payment on the loan because \nhis wife had a large amount of medical bills. (Ex. 3) The nature of his wife\u2019s illness or the \ncost of treatment are not reflected in the record. (Tr. 88) He said he was able to satisfy all \nhis other financial obligations. \nDuring a June 2015 enhanced subject interview, Applicant stated that in 2002, a \nstudent loan (SOR 1.f, $5,516) was opened in his name and his brother\u2019s name by an \nunknown person (Ex. 2) On his January 2015 Electronic Questionnaires for Investigations \nProcessing (e-QIP) he stated the \u201cloan was originated by my Brother,\u201d and Applicant was \ndisputing the debt. (Ex. 1) He has disputed the loan since he found out about the loan in \n2008 or 2009. (Ex. 2) In his April 2017 SOR Response, he denied the debt, but said he \nwas working to resolve it. His January 2015 credit report states the account was opened \nin January 2002 with a high credit level of $6,325 and a balance of $7,374. The loan \nrequired monthly payments of $60 for 196 months. (Ex. 4) In March 2012, a debt of $5,516 \nwas charged off. (Ex. 4) Applicant asserts this was his brother\u2019s student loan and does \nnot know how or why it is attached to his credit report. (Tr. 78) This loan belongs to his \nbrother living in Canada. (Tr. 81) Applicant never co-signed on any student loans. (Tr. 78)  \nApplicant admits he has a student loan with the same company to pay for his MBA \neducation. That loan is current. (Tr. 78) His January 2015 credit report states the larger \nstudent loan status is \u201cPays as Agreed,\u201d and it had a $33,307 balance. That loan required \n$196 monthly payments for 300 months. (Ex. 4) His November 2016 credit report \n\n \n6 \nindicates the balance on the larger student loans is $30,510. (Ex. 5) As of December 31, \n2017, the balance on the student loans was $28,645. (Ex. I-4) His February 2018 credit \nreport lists the balance as $28,658 with no past-due amounts. (Ex. 6) His May 2018 credit \nreport lists it as \u201ccurrent\u201d with a balance of $28,114. (Ex. I-5)  \nIn Applicant\u2019s January 2015 e-QIP he stated he owed $4,000 on a bank credit card \n(SOR 1.g, $4,557). (Ex. 1) He stated, \u201cI had a business in 2008 and as a result the \nbusiness accumulated some debt which I was the garantor [sic] and thus had to be liable.\u201d \n(Ex. 1) In his June 2015 interview he provided a different explanation of the charged-off \ncredit card debt. In the interview, he said the credit card account was opened in January \n2009 by an unknown individual as a result of identity theft. (Ex. 2) He told the investigator \nthat he did not know why it stated that he had a business in 2008, and as a result of \nbusiness debt accumulated, he was liable. (Ex. 2) He stated he did not know why the \ncase papers stated this. He asserted it was a fraudulent account, but asserted he paid it \nin March 2011 \u201cjust because he wanted it off of his credit report.\u201d (Ex. 2)  \nApplicant\u2019s January 2015 credit report lists two bank credit card accounts with the \ncreditor listed in SOR 1.g ($4,557), which is the debt referred to in the previous paragraph. \n(Ex. 4) He asserts one account is his, and he paid it, and the other account is a fraudulent \naccount. (Tr. 83) He asserted he could provide information on the account he paid. (Tr. \n83) No documents showing the debt had been paid were received. Both accounts were \nat times delinquent. One account opened in May 2006 had a high balance of $4,053 when \nit was closed by the grantor. (Ex. 4) The debt went to collection. The second account with \nthe same creditor was opened in August 2007 and $4,557 was charged off in September \n2014. (Ex. 4) He asserted he contacted the creditor, and they removed it from his credit \naccount. (Tr. 84) He provided no documentation supporting his assertion.  \nApplicant listed a federal credit union account debt of $7,300 on his e-QIP stating \nhe was disputing it and was working with a company to resolve the issue. (Ex. 1) The \ndebt (SOR 1.e, $13,263) was an automobile loan opened in September 2007 that \nrequired $353 monthly payments for 72 months. (Ex. 4) The high credit on the loan was \n$17,399. The delinquent obligation went to collection. (Ex. 4)  \nApplicant\u2019s January 2015 credit report lists two obligations to this federal credit \nunion, one in the amount of $13,263, listed as a collection account, and the other a $7,300 \naccount listed as \u201cPays as Agreed. The larger account was listed as \u201cclosed\u201d and the \nsmaller listed as \u201cAccount Closed by Grantor\u201d and charged off. (Ex. 4) The credit report \nlists both debts as \u201cDispute Resolved \u2013 Consumer Disagrees.\u201d (Ex. 4) He assets this was \na fraudulent account, that he worked with the credit union, and they removed it from his \ncredit report. (Tr. 76) He provided no documentation supporting his assertion.  \nThe credit card debt in SOR 1.h ($2,174) appears on Applicant\u2019s January 2015 \ncredit report listing that $2,174 had been charged off in December 2010. He asserts he \nreached a settlement with the creditor in 2011 and paid the debt. (Tr. 84) He provided no \ndocumentation supporting payment of the debt. He asserted he cannot \u201cget a hold of the \nbank to validate my account status. But this account was paid in full.\u201d (Ex. I-6) \n\n \n7 \nApplicant\u2019s November 2016 credit report lists a $1,469 telephone service collection \naccount (SOR 1.b) and a $115 cable television collection debt (SOR 1.c). (Ex. 6) He \nasserted the telephone account debt was a fraudulent account. He has had numerous \ncommunications with the telephone company and asserts the telephone company agreed \nthis was not his debt. (Tr. 72) His May 2018 credit report lists the account as closed and \nseriously past due date and assigned to a collection agency. (Ex. I-5) The debt also \nappears on his May 2018 credit report as closed and as a collection account. (Ex. I-5) As \nof August 2018, he was still working with the creditor to have the debt removed from his \ncredit report. (Ex. I) The debt is not reported by one credit reporting agency. (Ex. I-5) The \ncable debt arose when he moved. The account was paid and shows a zero balance on \nhis credit report. (Ex. I) \nOn Applicant\u2019s January 2015 e-QIP he listed $16,000 owed to the creditor listed in \nSOR 1.d ($16,599), but indicated it was caused by identity theft. On the e-QIP, he stated \nhe was working directly with all creditors and collection agencies listed on his credit profile \nto fix any pending issues. He said he was doing so to make sure it does not happen again \nand also to make sure his credit profile is correct. (Ex. 1) \nThe past-due account listed in SOR 1.d ($16,599) appears on Applicant\u2019s January \n2015 credit report listing the account as being opened in November 2011. It was listed as \nbeing 120 days or greater past due and in collection. (Ex. 4) The credit report also lists \nthe account as \u201cAccount in Dispute.\u201d In his June 2015 subject interview, he asserted this \ndebt was a fraudulent account opened by an unknown person. (Ex. 2) At the hearing, he \nsaid, \u201cI have no idea what this one \u2013 This one, too, was also a long time, and I just kept \ncalling them and denying [responsibility and stating] that it wasn\u2019t5 my debt, and \neventually, it was removed from my account.\u201d (Tr. 76) He provided no documentation \nsupporting this assertion.  \nApplicant makes regular contributions to his 401(k) retirement plan and has a \nbalance of approximately $53,000 in the plan. (Ex. H, Tr. 68) His wife has approximately \n$11,000 in her retirement plan. (Tr. 69) He has approximately $31,000 in savings. (Ex. I-\n1Tr. 69) Over the past four years he has spent approximately $30,000 working with his \nbrother to develop a computer application. (Tr. 90) His May 2018 credit report lists a \ncollection account with a zero balance. (Ex. I-5) \nPrior to closing arguments, Applicant was again informed of the importance of \nproviding documents to support his assertions of payment, settlement, or \nacknowledgement by the creditors that the delinquent obligations are not his. (Tr. 103) \n \nRepublic of Cameroon \nFrench Cameroon became independent in 1960 as the Republic of Cameroon. \nThe following year the southern portion of neighboring British Cameroon voted to merge \nwith the new country to form the Federal Republic of Cameroon. The country has \ngenerally enjoyed stability, which has enabled the development of agriculture, roads, and \n                                                          \n5 Applicant probably meant to say he kept calling them and denying it \u201cwas\u201d his debt.  \n\n \n8 \nrailways, as well as a petroleum industry. Political power remains firmly in the hands of \nthe President. \nThe United States established diplomatic relations with Cameroon in 1960, \nfollowing the independence of the French-administered part of the country. Cameroon \nhas had just two presidents since independence. U.S. relations with Cameroon are \npositive, although from time to time they have been affected by concerns over human \nrights abuses and the pace of political and economic liberalization. Cameroon plays a key \nrole in regional stability and remains a strong regional partner with the United States in \ncountering terrorism in the Lake Chad Region. Cameroon is currently the United States\u2019 \n124th largest goods trading partner. \n \nInternational migration from Cameroon has been driven by unemployment \n(including fewer government jobs), poverty, the search for educational opportunities, and \ncorruption. The United States and Europe are preferred destinations. Cameroon has a \nlarge youth population, with more than 60% of the populace under the age of 25. \n \n \nThe U.S. State Department warns U.S. citizens to avoid all travel to the North and \nFar North Regions and parts of the East and Adamawa Regions of Cameroon because \nof terrorist threats, the risk of violent crime, and civil unrest. (Cameroon Travel Warning, \nU.S. Embassy in Cameroon) Violent crime, such as armed robbery and carjacking, is \ncommon. Local police lack the resources to respond effectively to serious criminal \nincidents. In the North and Far North Regions, as well as parts of East and Adamawa \nRegions, terrorists may attack with no warning, targeting local facilities, and places \nfrequented by Westerners. Kidnapping by terrorists and/or kidnapping for ransom are \nserious concerns in Cameroon. \n In Northwest and Southwest Regions, an Anglophone separatist movement has \nled to increased levels of violence. Armed clashes with the government and other acts of \nviolence have occurred. The Boko Haram terrorist group has actively targeted foreign \nresidents, tourists, and government leaders in the North and Far North Region. The U.S. \nEmbassy\u2019s ability to provide consular services in remote and rural areas of Cameroon is \nextremely limited and the U.S. Government has limited ability to provide emergency \nservices to U.S. citizens. \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which must be considered in evaluating \nan applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \n\n \n9 \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), \nthe adjudication process is an examination of a sufficient period and a careful weight of a \nnumber of variables of an individual\u2019s life to make an affirmative determination that the \nindividual is an acceptable security risk. This is known as the whole-person concept.  \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record.  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation of potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination of the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \n \nAdjudicative Guideline (AG) \u00b6 18 articulates the security concerns relating to \nfinancial problems: \n \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information . . . An individual who is financially \noverextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or otherwise \nquestionable acts to generate funds. \n \n\n \n10 \nAdditionally, an individual who is financially irresponsible may also be \nirresponsible, unconcerned, negligent, or careless in properly handling and safeguarding \nclassified information. Behaving responsibly or irresponsibly in one aspect of life provides \nan indication of how a person may behave in other aspects of life. \n \nA person\u2019s relationship with his creditors is a private matter until evidence is \nuncovered demonstrating an inability or unwillingness to repay debts under agreed-upon \nterms. Absent evidence of strong extenuating or mitigating circumstances, an applicant \nwith a history of serious or recurring financial difficulties is in a position of risk that is \ninconsistent with holding a security clearance. An applicant is not required to be debt free, \nbut is required to manage his finances to meet his financial obligations. \n \nAG \u00b6 19 includes two disqualifying conditions that could raise a security concern \nand may be disqualifying in this case: \u201c(a) inability to satisfy debts;\u201d and \u201c(c) a history of \nnot meeting financial obligations.\u201d Security concerns are established under AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) \nand 19(c) because Applicant had eight delinquent debts which totaled in excess of \n$54,000. The burden shifted to Applicant to produce evidence to rebut, explain, \nextenuate, or mitigate the security concerns. (Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15) \n \nThe Appeal Board concisely explained Applicant\u2019s responsibility for proving the \napplicability of mitigating conditions as follows: \n \nOnce a concern arises regarding an Applicant\u2019s security clearance \neligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance of \na security clearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th \nCir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991). After the Government \npresents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the \napplicant to rebut or mitigate those concerns. See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. The \nstandard applicable in security clearance decisions is that articulated in \nEgan, supra. \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access \nto classified information will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nDirective, Enclosure 2 \u00b6 2(b). \n \nISCR Case No. 10-04641 at 4 (App. Bd. Sept. 24, 2013).  \n \n \nThe Appeal Board explained the scope and rationale for the financial \nconsiderations security concern in ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012) \n(citation omitted) as follows: \n \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an applicant might \nknowingly compromise classified information in order to raise money in \nsatisfaction of his or her debts. Rather, it requires a Judge to examine the \ntotality of an applicant\u2019s financial history and circumstances. The Judge \nmust consider pertinent evidence regarding the applicant\u2019s self-control, \njudgment, and other qualities essential to protecting the national secrets as \nwell as the vulnerabilities inherent in the circumstances. The Directive \n\n \n11 \npresumes a nexus between proven conduct under any of the Guidelines \nand an applicant\u2019s security eligibility. \n \nApplicant has the burden of establishing that matters in mitigation apply. One or \nmore of the following conditions under AG \u00b6 20 may apply: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem from \na legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit counseling \nservice, and there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved \nor is under control; \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue. \n \nIt is incumbent on Applicant to provide sufficient documentation to support all \nmitigating claims or assertions he has made. This he failed to do. Other than payments \non Applicant\u2019s student loans, he has failed to document any payment on the SOR \ndelinquent obligations. In April 2016, Applicant voluntarily returned a vehicle to the \ncreditor and incurred a $10,928 debt (SOR 1.a). In July 2016, he said he was in the \nprocess of setting up a repayment plan. In his April 2017 SOR Response, he said he was \nworking on resolving the debt. At the March 2018 hearing, he asserted he was working \nwith the creditor to resolve the debt. He provided no documents supporting his \ncommunications with the creditor, a copy of a repayment plan, or evidence he has paid \nthe debt.  \n \nApplicant asserted the telephone service debt (SOR 1.b, $1,469) was a fraudulent \naccount. He never provided any documentation establishing it was a fraudulent account \nor a copy of any police report asking the police to investigate the fraud. He asserted he \nhad numerous communications with the telephone company and asserted the telephone \ncompany agreed it was not his debt. He never provided any documentation establishing \nthe creditor agreed it was not his debt. As the debt appears as a collection account on his \nMay 2018 credit report, and in August 2018, he said he was still working with the creditor \n\n \n12 \nto have the debt removed from his credit report. The $115 cable debt (SOR 1.c) was paid \nand is showing with a zero balance on his credit report. \n \nOn his January 2015 e-QIP, Applicant listed $16,000 owed to the creditor in SOR \n1.d ($16,599) and he indicated it was a fraudulent account. On his e-QIP, he asserted he \nwas working directly with all his creditors and collection agencies to fix any pending \nissues. At the hearing, he said he had no idea about the debt. He said he kept calling the \ncreditor, he denied the debt was his, and it was removed from his credit account. He \nprovided no documentation supporting the debt was fraudulent or documentation of \ncontacting the creditor.  \n \nApplicant asserted the credit union auto loan (SOR 1.e, $13,263) was also a \nfraudulent account. Again, he asserted he worked with the credit union lender, and it was \nremoved from his credit report. He provided no documentation supporting the debt was \nfraudulent or documentation of contacting the creditor. He disputed the student loan debt \n(SOR 1.f, $5,516) asserting it is his brother\u2019s student loan debt and claiming he does not \nknow why it appears on his credit report. Applicant provided documentation showing he \nis making timely payments on his student loans. His credit reports lists his student loan \nas being paid as agreed with no past-due amounts and with a balance consistently being \nreduced.  \n \nOn Applicant\u2019s January 2015 e-QIP, he stated he owed $4,000 on a bank credit \ncard due (SOR 1.g, $4,557) to business expenses but stated during his June 2015 \ninterview that the account was a fraudulent account opened by an unknown person. \nDuring the same interview, he said he paid the listed amount just to get it off his credit \nreport. At the hearing, he asserted he contacted the creditor, and the debt was removed \nfrom his credit account. He provided no documentation supporting the debt was \nfraudulent, that he had paid the debt, or that he contacted the creditor. He asserted the \ncredit card debt in SOR 1.h ($2,174) had been paid, but provided no documentation \nshowing payment. \n \nApplicant presented some mitigating information. He asserted he was unable to \npay some of his debts when his wife became ill and was unable to work. However, he \nfailed to provide sufficient information as to the nature, cost of the treatment, length of the \nillness, or when it occurred. He has equity in a home he owns and rents. He is current on \nhis student loan payments. He has $53,000 in his retirement plan and $31,000 in his \nsavings account. He recently obtained a loan on a $460,000 new home. Obtaining such \na loan indicates that the lender is sufficiently satisfied that Applicant is a good credit risk. \nThe household income, from his income and now that his wife has returned to work, is \nnot a part of the record.  \n \nThe mitigating factors in AG \u00b6 20(a) do not apply because the debts are numerous \nand remain unpaid. AG \u00b6 20(b) does not apply even though there are some factors that \nwere beyond his control such as his wife\u2019s illness and his assertion of identity theft. Even \nif the delinquent obligations Applicant asserts to be fraudulent, there are other delinquent \nobligations that remain unpaid. The small amount of documented payments shows he \nhas not acted responsibly under the circumstances to address his delinquent obligations. \n\n \n13 \nFor AG \u00b6 20(c) to apply there must be financial counseling, and clear indications that the \nproblem is being resolved or is under control, neither of which have not been documented.  \n \n \nIn Applicant\u2019s January 2015 e-QIP, his June 2015 interview, his July 2016 \ninterview, his April 2017 SOR Response, and at the hearing, he indicated he was \nattempting to established repayment plans for some of the SOR delinquent obligations. \nOther than payment on his student loans, which was not a delinquent SOR obligation, \nand the $115 cable bill, no payments had been made or evidence provided that \nrepayment plans existed. Although Applicant denies certain SOR delinquent obligations, \nAG \u00b6 20(e) does not apply because he has failed to document the fraudulent account \nassertions. AG \u00b6 20(e) requires Applicant to dispute the legitimacy of the past-due debts \nand provides documented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. No documentation was received.  \n \nAn Applicant is not required to be debt-free or to develop a plan for paying off all \ndebts immediately or simultaneously, but he is required to act responsibly given his \ncircumstances and develop a reasonable plan to address his delinquent obligations, \naccompanied by evidence of a serious intent to effectuate the plan. This has not been \ndone. \n \nForeign Influence \n \n  \nAG \u00b6 6 explains the security concern about foreign influence as follows: \n \nForeign contacts and interests, including, but not limited to, business, \nfinancial, and property interests, are a national security concern if they result \nin divided allegiance. They may also be a national security concern if they \ncreate circumstances in which the individual may be manipulated or induced \nto help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a way \ninconsistent with U.S. interests or otherwise made vulnerable to pressure \nor coercion by any foreign interest. Assessment of foreign contacts and \ninterests should consider the country in which the foreign contact or interest \nis located, including, but not limited to, considerations such as whether it is \nknown to target U.S. citizens to obtain classified or sensitive information or \nis associated with a risk of terrorism. \n \nAG \u00b6 7 indicates three conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying in this case: \n \n(a) contact, regardless of method, with a foreign family member, business \nor professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or \nresident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of \nforeign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; \n \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual's obligation to \nprotect classified or sensitive information or technology and the individual's \n\n \n14 \ndesire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing that \ninformation or technology; and \n \n(e) shared living quarters with a person or persons, regardless of citizenship \nstatus, if that relationship creates a heightened risk of foreign inducement, \nmanipulation, pressure, or coercion. \nIn June 2012, Applicant became a naturalized U.S. citizen. He came to the United \nStates as a student. He feared for his life in Cameroon and applied for political asylum in \nthe United States. In 1997, he had been arrested for protesting against the Cameroon \ngovernment. His wife and brother had also been arrested for political protesting. One of \nhis cousins has been jailed indefinitely and Applicant has had friends killed by the police.  \nApplicant\u2019s wife and sister were born in Cameroon and are U.S. registered aliens \nliving in the United States pending their U.S. citizenship. He anticipates his wife will \nbecome a naturalized U.S. citizen in 2020. His two children are U.S residents, having \nbeen born in the United States. His one brother is a naturalized U.S. citizen and his other \nbrother lives in Canada and is a Canadian permanent resident pending Canadian \ncitizenship. Applicant feels loyalty to the United States and has no divided loyalty. \nCameroon does not accept dual citizenship.  \nApplicant\u2019s mother is a Cameroon national who is a retired civil servant. In her mid-\n30 to mid-40s, she worked ten years as a meteorologist for the Cameroon government. \nHis mother, who is currently visiting him, is a U.S. registered alien pending her citizenship. \nHe has frequent contact with his parents in Cameroon. Applicant\u2019s father, a Cameroon \nnational, is a retired justice of the Supreme Court of the Republic of Cameroon. His \nparents receive pensions from the Cameroon government.  \nApplicant\u2019s father-in-law is a Cameroon national, retired from the Cameroon \nrailway services, and is now a fireman. Applicant has contact with his father-in-law by \ntelephone twice a month. His wife has two siblings living in Cameroon and three living in \nthe United States. However, the record is silent as to how much, if any, contact Applicant \nor his spouse have with his wife\u2019s siblings.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s ties with his parents living in Cameroon, are not, as a matter of law, \ndisqualifying under Guideline B. However, if an applicant or his spouse has a close \nrelationship with even one relative, living in a foreign country, this factor alone is sufficient \nto create the potential for foreign influence and could potentially result in the compromise \nof classified information. See ISCR Case No. 03-02382 at 5 (App. Bd. Feb. 15, 2006); \nISCR Case No. 99-0424 (App. Bd. Feb. 8, 2001).  \n \nThere is a rebuttable presumption that a person has ties of affection for, or \nobligation to, their immediate family members. See generally ISCR Case No. 01-03120, \n2002 DOHA LEXIS 94 at *8 (App. Bd. Feb. 20, 2002). \u201c[A]s a matter of common sense \nand human experience, there is [also] a rebuttable presumption that a person has ties of \naffection for, or obligation to, the immediate family members of the person\u2019s spouse.\u201d \nISCR Case No. 07-17673 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 2, 2009) (citing ISCR Case No. 01-03120 \n\n \n15 \nat 4 (App. Bd. Feb. 20, 2002)). This concept is the basis of AG \u00b6 7(e). Indirect influence \nfrom his parents and his spouse\u2019s father living in Cameroon could result in a security \nconcern. See ISCR Case No. 09-05812 at 2 (App. Bd. Dec. 1, 2011) (finding presence in \na country of close family members, viewed in light of that country\u2019s troubles with terrorism \nand its human rights abuses, and his sharing living quarters with a person (his spouse) \nhaving foreign family contacts, establish the \u201cheightened risk\u201d in AG \u00b6\u00b6 7(b) and 7(e)).  \n \nApplicant\u2019s relationship with his parents could create a concern about Applicant\u2019s \n\u201cobligation to protect sensitive information or technology\u201d and possibly his desire to help \nhis parents living in Cameroon. It is possible intelligence officials or other entities in \nCameroon wanting to expose Applicant to coercion, could exert pressure on his parents \nliving in Cameroon. Applicant would then be subject to coercion through his parents and \nclassified information could potentially be compromised. This is countered by him, his \nwife, brother, and cousin having been imprisoned by the Cameroon government for \npolitical protesting. Serving imprisonment for political protesting does not endear one to \nthe government that imprisons him or her.  \n \nGuideline B is not limited to countries hostile to the United States. \u201cThe United \nStates has a compelling interest in protecting and safeguarding classified information \nfrom any person, organization, or country that is not authorized to have access to it, \nregardless of whether that person, organization, or country has interests inimical to those \nof the United States.\u201d ISCR Case No. 02-11570 at 5 (App. Bd. May 19, 2004). \nFurthermore, friendly nations can have profound disagreements with the United States \nover matters they view as important to their vital interests or national security. Finally, we \nknow friendly nations have engaged in espionage against the United States, especially \nin the economic, scientific, and technical fields. See ISCR Case No. 00-0317, 2002 \nDOHA LEXIS 83 at **15-16 (App. Bd. Mar. 29, 2002).  \n \nWhile there is no evidence that intelligence operatives or terrorists from Cameroon \nseek or have sought classified or economic information from or through Applicant or \nsiblings living in Cameroon, nevertheless, it is not possible to rule out such a possibility \nin the future.  \n \nAG \u00b6 8 lists three conditions that could mitigate foreign influence security concerns \nincluding: \n \n(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in which \nthese persons are located, or the positions or activities of those persons in \nthat country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be placed in a \nposition of having to choose between the interests of a foreign individual, \ngroup, organization, or government and the interests of the U.S.; \n \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of \nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, group, government, or country is \nso minimal, or the individual has such deep and longstanding relationships \nand loyalties in the U.S., that the individual can be expected to resolve any \nconflict of interest in favor of the U.S. interest; and \n\n \n16 \n \n(c) contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and \ninfrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign \ninfluence or exploitation. \n \nThe Appeal Board concisely explained Applicant\u2019s responsibility for proving the \napplicability of mitigating conditions as follows: \n \nOnce a concern arises regarding an Applicant\u2019s security clearance \neligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance of \na security clearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th \nCir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991). After the Government \npresents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the \napplicant to rebut or mitigate those concerns. See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. The \nstandard applicable in security clearance decisions is that articulated in \nEgan, supra. \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access \nto classified information will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nDirective, Enclosure 2 \u00b6 2(b). \n \nISCR Case No. 10-04641 at 4 (App. Bd. Sept. 24, 2013). \n \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 8(a) and 8(c) apply. Applicant has frequent contact with his parents living \nin Cameroon and less frequent contact with his father-in-law. His mother and father\u2019s \npast employment with the Cameroon government makes reviewing the foreign influence \nsecurity concerns critical. Applicant\u2019s wife and siblings are not a security concern. His \none brother is a U.S. naturalized citizen. His other brother is a lives in Canada and is a \nCanadian permanent resident pending Canadian citizenship. His wife, sister, and mother \nare U.S. registered aliens. There is little likelihood that his relationships with his wife or \nsiblings could create a risk for foreign influence or exploitation.  \n \nAG \u00b6 8(b) applies. A key factor in the AG \u00b6 8(b) analysis is Applicant\u2019s \u201cdeep and \nlongstanding relationships and loyalties in the U.S.\u201d Applicant has significant connections \nto the United States. Applicant, his children, and his brother are citizens and residents of \nthe United States. His spouse, sister, and mother are registered aliens waiting to become \nnaturalized citizens. He left Cameroon and received refugee status, as did his wife and \nsiblings. In 2003, he received his MBA from an American university. He owns one home \nin the United States and his received a loan to purchase a second home in the United \nStates.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s relationship with the United States must be weighed against the \npotential conflict of interest created by his relationships with family living in Cameroon. \nThere is no evidence, however, that terrorists, criminals, the Cameroon Government, or \nthose conducting espionage have approached or threatened Applicant or his siblings \nliving in Cameroon to coerce Applicant for classified or sensitive information. While the \nU.S. Government does not have any burden to prove the presence of such evidence, if \nsuch record evidence were present, Applicant would have a heavier evidentiary burden \nto mitigate foreign influence security concerns.  \n\n \n17 \nIn sum, Applicant has significant connections to the United States. He came to the \nUnited States at age 20 and is now 40 years old. The foreign influence security concerns \nare mitigated. \n \nWhole-Person Analysis  \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept. An administrative judge must evaluate \nan Applicant\u2019s security eligibility by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s conduct and \nall the relevant circumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.  \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuidelines B and F in the whole-person analysis. Applicant\u2019s parents and father-in-law \nlive in Cameroon. His wife, sister, and mother are U.S. registered aliens waiting for the \npermanent U.S. citizenship. His one brother is a naturalized U.S. citizen and his other \nbrother is a Canadian permanent resident living in Canada pending Canadian citizenship. \nHis children are U.S. citizens. The foreign influence security concerns are mitigated by \nApplicant\u2019s significant connections to the United States.  \n \nApplicant has a history of financial problems. He has known about the \nGovernment\u2019s concern about his finances since his June 2015 and July 2016 interviews, \nand the March 2017 SOR. The $115 cable bill has been addressed and he is current on \nhis student loan payments, which were not alleged as delinquent in the SOR. He asserts, \nbut failed to document, he has been in contact with his creditors. He has not shown that \nhe acted responsibly to address his delinquent debts. Applicant\u2019s failure to make greater \nprogress resolving his SOR debts shows lack of financial responsibility and judgment and \nraises unmitigated questions about his reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified information. See AG \u00b6 18. The issue is not simply whether all Applicant\u2019s debts \nare paid\u2014it is whether his financial circumstances raise concerns about his fitness to hold \na security clearance. See AG \u00b6\u00b6 2(a) and 2(b). \n \n\n \n18 \nThis decision should not be construed as a determination that Applicant cannot or \nwill not attain the state of true reform and rehabilitation necessary to be eligible for a \nsecurity clearance due to financial considerations. The determination of an individual\u2019s \neligibility and suitability for a security clearance is not a once in a lifetime occurrence, but \nis based on applying the factors, both disqualifying and mitigating, to the evidence \npresented. Under Applicant=s current circumstances, a clearance is not warranted. In the \nfuture, Applicant may well demonstrate persuasive evidence of his security worthiness.  \n \nIt is well settled that once a concern arises regarding an Applicant\u2019s security \nclearance eligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or renewal of a \nsecurity clearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th Cir. 1990). After \nweighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions and evaluating all the evidence in the \ncontext of the whole person, the unmitigated financial considerations security concerns \nlead me to conclude that grant of a security clearance to Applicant is not warranted at this \ntime. This decision should not be construed as a determination that Applicant cannot or \nwill not attain the state of reform necessary for award of a security clearance in the future. \nIn the future, with a track record of addressing his delinquent financial obligations, he may \nwell be able to demonstrate persuasive evidence of his security clearance worthiness.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFinancial Considerations Security Concern:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a and 1.b:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.c:   \n  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.d through 1.h:   \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nForeign Influence Security Concern: \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 2.a through 2.d:   \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for \naccess to classified information.

Blazewick, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Leon J. Schachter, Esquire\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nMETZ, John Grattan, Jr., Administrative Judge:\nBased on the record in this case,  I deny Applicant\u2019s clearance.\n1\nOn 4 January 2017, the Department of Defense (DoD) sent Applicant a\nStatement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security concerns under Guideline F, Financial\nConsiderations.  Applicant timely answered the SOR, requesting a hearing before the\n2\nConsisting of the transcript (Tr.), Government exhibits (GE) 1-4, hearing exhibit (HE) I, and Applicant Exhibits\n1\n(AE) A-M. AE L was admitted for the sole purpose of identifying AE A-K for the record (Tr.17-18). AE M was\ntimely received post hearing. The record in this case closed 30 January 2018, when Department Counsel\nnoted no objection to AE M. I amended the SOR to add the March 2018 Chapter 13 bankruptcy petition, based\non Applicant\u2019s AE I (Tr. 90-92).\nDoD acted under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information Within Industry (February 20,\n2\n1960), as amended; DoD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program\n(January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) effective within the DoD on\n1 September 2006. However, on 10 December 2016, the Director of National Intelligence (DNI) signed\nSecurity Executive Agent Directive 4, implementing new AG, effective with any decision issued on or after 8\nJune 2017. My decision is the same under both guidelines.\n1\n02/26/2019\n\nDefense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA). DOHA assigned the case to me 27\nSeptember 2017 and I convened a hearing 5 April 2018. DOHA received the transcript\n17 April  2018.\nFindings of Fact\nApplicant admitted the SOR allegations. He is a 63-year-old aircraft mechanic\nemployed by a U.S. defense contractor since June 1992.  He has previously had\n3\nfavorable background investigations in July 2002 and August 2013. The genesis of the\ncurrent background investigation is unclear (GE 1).\nThe SOR alleges, Government exhibits substantiate, and Applicant admits eight\ndelinquent debts totaling over $99,000. The debts comprise $200 in delinquent traffic\ntickets (SOR 1.k-1.l),  a $2,700 state tax lien (SOR 1.j),  four delinquent medical\n4\n5\naccounts totaling nearly $1,400 (SOR 1.f-1.I),  and a delinquent education loan totaling\n6\nover $95,000 (SOR 1.e).  The SOR also alleges, Government and Applicant exhibits\n7\nestablish, and Applicant admits filing for Chapter 13 bankruptcy protection five times\nbetween August 1998 and March 2018 (SOR 1.a-1.d and 1.m). The March 2018 filing\nwas pending approval (AE I); the October 2013 filing was converted to a Chapter 7\npetition in March 2014, and discharged in November 2014. The August 1998, October\n2000, and September 2011 petitions were dismissed in October 1999, June 2001, and\nMarch 2013, respectively.  Applicant completed the bankruptcy-required financial\n8\ncounseling in February 2018 [AE C(2)], and another financial counseling in March 2018\n[AE C(1)]. His tentative Chapter 13 plan anticipated the creditors\u2019 meeting later in April\nHe has also been self-employed in the vending machine business since April 2010.\n3\nPaid by Applicant on 2 February 2017 (Answer, AE H). The amounts and creditor are an exact match.\n4\nAE G, a 26 February 2018 letter from the state tax authority, reflects an agreement to pay $121.50 toward\n5\na $716 tax liability. However, the account number listed is not the same as that listed on GE 2 and 3 for SOR\ndebt 1.j. Moreover, Applicant did not document any of the required payments for February and March 2018.\nApplicant paid SOR 1.i on 30 January 2017 (AE F). He paid SOR 1.h on 30 January 2017 as well (Answer,\n6\nAE E). He paid SOR 1.g the same day (Answer). He offered AE M(10) as proof that SOR 1 f was paid on 15\nFebruary 2017, but the amounts do not match and GE 3 contains no account number for the account.\nAE M(14) reflects that Applicant entered into a rehabilitation agreement on 24 June 2014 in which he was\n7\nto pay $5.00 monthly beginning 25 June 2016, and continuing until he made nine voluntary and on time\npayments within a ten month period..AE D confirmed his entry into the program.  AE M(9) shows that he made\n13 $5.00 payments between June 2017 and February 2017, at which point the rehabilitated loan was\napparently purchased by another lender in accordance with the rehabilitation agreement. The outstanding\nbalance for the loan when it went into rehabilitation was $92,421.46, almost the amount listed on Applicant\u2019s \nMarch 2018 petition (AE I, M(15) under a different creditor, presumably the successor-in-interest.\nThe August 1998 and October 2000 petitions were dismissed when Applicant received insurance settlements\n8\nwhich allowed him to repay his creditors. The September 2011 petition was dismissed when Applicant was\nable to gather the funds necessary to repay his creditors.\n2\n\n2018, with confirmation in May 2018. The plan called for $700 monthly payments, and\nApplicant made the first required payment the week after the hearing [AE M(12)].\nApplicant reported his two most recent (at the time) bankruptcy petitions on his\nJune 2015 clearance application (GE 1). He resolved approximately $60,000 in debt in\nhis September 2011 Chapter 13 petition, and resolved approximately $70,000 in debt in\nhis November 2014 Chapter 7 discharge. His pending Chapter 13 petition lists\napproximately $135,000 in unsecured claims, of which over $93,000 are an education\nloan and another nearly $9,000 are to state and Federal tax authorities. Neither of these\ndebts is likely to be dischargeable. Applicant documented that he had an installment\nplan with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), and made his $100 July 2017 payment as\nrequired [AE M(11)]. However, his balance at the time was over $9,000.  \n9\nApplicant\u2019 financial problems predate his August 1998 Chapter 13 bankruptcy\npetition. He and his wife have been plagued with a seemingly endless string of\naccidents, injuries, and illnesses.  The August 1998 petition was precipitated by an\n10\nautomobile accident that left her unable to work for two years (Tr. 25), but was\ndismissed in October 1999 when the case settled and Applicant was able to pay his\ncreditors. Similarly, the October 2000 petition was precipitated by another accident that\nleft his wife unable to work for a long time; additionally, Applicant had an illness that\nrequired a week in the hospital. However, the petition was dismissed in June 2001 when\nthe case settled and Applicant was able to pay his creditors.\nNevertheless, their medical adventures continued: in 2003, their minor child had\na burst appendix and was hospitalized for three weeks; in 2004, Applicant\u2019s wife had\nadditional knee surgery from the earlier accident, and Applicant had pneumonia. He\nmissed time at work, which was unpaid because he had used all his accumulated time\noff. Applicant\u2019s wife had another accident in 2005, had major breast cancer surgery in\n2007, costing $30,000 out of pocket, and another accident. She had more knee surgery\nin 2008 and a knee replacement in 2009.\nApplicant had a collapsed lung in 2010, three surgeries to repair it, and six more\nweeks out of work. In 2011, he had another bout of pneumonia, and was out of work\nanother three weeks. He filed for Chapter 13 bankruptcy again in September 2011, but\nwas able to catch up on his payments to his creditors and have the petition discharged\nin March 2013 (Tr. 53).  Meanwhile, in 2012, he developed knee problems himself\nwhich required surgery. He filed another Chapter 13 petition in October 2013, converted\nit to a Chapter 7 petition in March 2014, when he realized that he would not be able to\nmake the required plan payments, and was discharged of his dischargeable debt in\nNovember 2014.\nHe listed $10,000 IRS debt on his March 2018 Chapter 13 petition.\n9\nApplicant\u2019s wife experienced serious medical issues beginning in 1992, when she had three accidents; she\n10\nhad another serious accident in 1994, and again in 1997, leading to surgery in 1998 (Tr. 45-46).\n3\n\n Applicant\u2019s financial reprieve was short lived. In 2014, his wife tripped in the\ndriveway, smashed her elbow, and required three surgeries to repair the damage.\nApplicant took time off from work to care for her. Their out-of-pocket expenses were\n$40,000-50,000. In 2015, she had another accident, which required her fourth neck\nsurgery to repair. Those out-of-pocket expenses ran $20,000-$30,000. She later\ncontracted pneumonia in 2016, which devolved into bronchitis, incurring more medical\nbills. Applicant was diagnosed with bladder cancer in 2017, but the cancer was detected\nearly, and his prognosis is good (Tr. 37-38). In 2018, Applicant\u2019s wife had hip\nreplacement surgery, but hurt herself while in rehabilitation, which required a second\nsurgery, and developed an infection which required a third surgery; the expected out-of-\npocket expense is $30,000.\nApplicant documented his credit and financial counseling, and submitted a\nFebruary 2018 personal financial statement (PFS) showing $39 positive monthly cash\nflow (AE J). In fairness to Applicant, he overlooked additional sources of income [AE\nM(5)-M(8)]. His March 2018 Chapter 13 petition shows $700 positive monthly cash flow.\nApplicant\u2019s work and character references [AE J, M(13)] have both known him for many\nyears, are aware of Applicant\u2019s financial problems, and hold clearances themselves.\nThey consider Applicant honest and trustworthy, and recommend him for his clearance,\nnotwithstanding his financial troubles.\nPolicies\nThe adjudicative guidelines (AG) list factors for evaluating a person\u2019s suitability\nfor access to classified information. Administrative judges must assess disqualifying and\nmitigating conditions under each issue fairly raised by the facts and situation presented.\nEach decision must also reflect a fair, impartial, and commonsense consideration of the\nfactors listed in AG \u00b6 2(a). Any one disqualifying or mitigating condition is not, by itself,\nconclusive. However, specific adjudicative guidelines should be followed where a case\ncan be measured against them, as they represent policy guidance governing access to\nclassified information. Considering the SOR allegations and the evidence as a whole,\nthe relevant adjudicative guideline is Guideline F (Financial Considerations).\nSecurity clearance decisions resolve whether it is clearly consistent with the\nnational interest to grant or continue an applicant\u2019s security clearance. The Government\nmust prove, by substantial evidence, controverted facts alleged in the SOR. If it does, \nthe burden shifts to applicant to refute, extenuate, or mitigate the Government\u2019s case.\nBecause no one has a right to a security clearance, the applicant bears a heavy burden\nof persuasion.\nPersons with access to classified information enter into a fiduciary relationship\nwith the Government based on trust and confidence. Therefore, the Government has a\ncompelling interest in ensuring each applicant possesses the requisite judgement,\nreliability, and trustworthiness of those who must protect national interests as their own.\nThe \u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d standard compels resolution of any\n4\n\nreasonable doubt about an applicant\u2019s suitability for access in favor of the\nGovernment.11\nAnalysis\nThe Government established a case for disqualification under Guideline F, and\nApplicant failed to mitigate the security concerns. Setting aside for a moment\nApplicant\u2019s first four bankruptcy petitions, Applicant had over $4,000 in delinquent debt\nthat he did not address until after he received the SOR, a $95,000 delinquent education\nloan which he began rehabilitating before the SOR was issued, but for which he\nsubmitted no current status, and a March 2018 Chapter 13 bankruptcy petition which\nwas still pending creditors\u2019 input and court approval.12\nThe mitigating conditions for financial considerations provide insufficient help to\nApplicant. The conduct was recent, frequent, and the circumstances were only unusual\nto the extent that he has been plagued with more than his fair share of unfortunate\nluck.  That said, the circumstances of his financial problems were certainly largely\n13\nbeyond his control, and he has been responsible in addressing his debts up to a point.  \n14\n     \nBankruptcy, whether Chapter 13 or Chapter 7, is a legitimate means of obtaining\na new start when circumstances beyond your control overwhelm your ability to pay. And\nthe frequency of bankruptcies is not necessarily disqualifying in the absence of self-\ndealing or unscrupulous behavior. There is no evidence that either Applicant or his wife\nhave so behaved. Consequently, the first four bankruptcy petitions are easily resolved in\nApplicant\u2019s favor, as the first three petitions were dismissed when he satisfied his\ncreditors, and the fourth represented a not-unusual progression from Chapter 13 to\nChapter 7 and a new financial start (SOR 1.a-1.d).\n \nWhat remains is the Applicant\u2019s handling of his SOR debt, and his pending\nChapter 13 bankruptcy petition. Applicant documented that he satisfied SOR debts !.f-\n1.l after he received the SOR. Applicant documented that he initiated, and substantially\ncompleted, a rehabilitation program on his $95,000 delinquent education loan (SOR\n1.e). He appears to have made the required rehabilitation payments by March 2017. But\nhe documented no loan status after March 2017, at which point the holder of the loan\nwould have attempted to obtain a rehabilitation loan lender in accordance with the\nrehabilitation agreement. His March 2018 Chapter 13 bankruptcy petition (AE I) lists two\nSee, Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518 (1988).\n11\n\u00b619(a) inability to satisfy debts; (b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so; (c) a\n12\nhistory of not meeting financial obligations;\n\u00b620(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such circumstances that\n13\nit is unlikely to recur . . . \n\u00b620(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s control . . . and\n14\nthe individual acted responsibly under the circumstances;\n5\n\neducation loan accounts with a creditor who could be a successor-in-interest to the\nSOR creditor, one with a $93,632 balance, one with an unknown balance. Under the\nterms of his rehabilitation agreement, if this loan has been defaulted again, it cannot be\nrehabilitated a second time. Finally, the bankruptcy petition itself is still pending\nimportant steps. As with the other bankruptcies, the mitigating conditions only get the\nApplicant so far. The petition is not distant, not infrequent, and occurred under\ncircumstances capable of repetition. On the other hand, the petition was due again to\ncircumstances beyond his control, and filing the petition can be considered a\nresponsible action under the circumstances. Where Applicant falls short is his inability to\nshow progress on the petition. While he made the first contemplated payment under the\nas-yet-unapproved plan, that payment is insufficient to establish a favorable track\nrecord.\n \nWhile Applicant has documented credit and financial counseling, it is too soon to\nconclude that his financial problems have been resolved or are under control.  This\n15\nfailure of evidence precludes a conclusion that Applicant has made a good-faith effort to\naddress his debts because he cannot show substantial evidence that he is adhering to\nhis effort.  Applicant\u2019s timely efforts to address his education loans had reached the\n16\npoint where he was on the cusp of regular payments, but he has no established track\nrecord of payments. The few months of $5 payments are not sufficient, without showing\nwhat happened to the loan after March 2017. Applicant\u2019s efforts to address his debts\nwere belated. Moreover, his two favorable work or character references are insufficient\nto support a whole-person assessment to overcome the security concerns raised by his\ncurrent financial situation. I conclude Guideline F against Applicant.\nFormal Findings\nParagraph 1. Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs a-d:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraphs e-m:\nAgainst Applicant\n\u00b620(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem . . .  and there are clear indications\n15\nthat the problem is being resolved or is under control;\n\u00b620(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise\n16\nresolve debts.\n6\n\nConclusion\nUnder the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for\nApplicant.

In addition to brief introductory \nexplanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially disqualifying \nconditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s \nnational security eligibility. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious \nscrutiny of a number of variables known as the whole-person concept. The \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record.  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 states the \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d  \n \n \nA person who applies for access to classified information seeks to enter into a \nfiduciary relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n \nSection 7 of Executive Order (EO) 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall \nbe \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the \nloyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple \nprerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \n \n \n \n\n \n4 \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F - Financial Considerations \n \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG \u00b6 18: \n \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. Two are potentially applicable in this case:   \n \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \n \n  \nApplicant had significant past-due indebtedness. The evidence is sufficient to \nraise these disqualifying conditions.  \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. I considered \nall of the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 including: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; and \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.  \n\n \n5 \n \nApplicant is addressing, through making monthly payments, all but one of the \nalleged past-due debts that are of concern to the Government. The other alleged past-\ndue debt he has paid. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept.  \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline F in my whole-person analysis. Applicant has a distinguished history of \nworking in the defense industry and is respected by his supervisor. (TR at page 35 line \n16 to page 37 line 1.) He performs well at his job.  \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant mitigated the Financial Considerations security concerns.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.b:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.c:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.d:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.e:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n\n \n6 \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant national security eligibility \nfor a security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \n \n \n \n \nRichard A. Cefola \nAdministrative Judge \n",

Applicant pled guilty to a \nmisdemeanor offense of pointing a weapon at others and received a three year deferred \nsentence. He has mitigated the criminal conduct and personal conduct security \nconcerns. Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information is granted.  \nStatement of the Case \nOn May 9, 2017, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications Facility \n(DoD CAF) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant, detailing the security \nconcerns under Guideline J, criminal conduct, and Guideline E, personal conduct, and \nexplaining why it was unable to find it clearly consistent with the national interest to \ngrant or continue security clearance eligibility for him.1  \n1 The DoD CAF took the action under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \nIndustry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DoD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security \nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the Adjudicative Guidelines \n04/02/2019\n\n \n2 \nOn May 30, 2017, Applicant answered the SOR allegations and requested a \nhearing before an administrative judge from the Defense Office of Hearings and \nAppeals (DOHA). On February 7, 2018, DOHA issued a Notice of Hearing scheduling a \nhearing that was conducted on February 28, 2018.  \n \nFive Government exhibits (Ex. 1-5) and five Applicant exhibits (Ex. A-E) were \nadmitted into evidence without objection. Records submitted by Applicant as \nattachments to his answer were considered. Applicant testified, as reflected in a \ntranscript (Tr.) received on March 9, 2018. I held the record open after the hearing for \nApplicant to submit additional documents. Following the hearing, the Order of Dismissal \nwas admitted as Ex. F. \n \nWhile this case was pending a decision, the Director of National Intelligence \nissued Security Executive Agent Directive 4, establishing the National Security \nAdjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information or \nEligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position (AGs), which he made applicable to all covered \nindividuals who require initial or continued eligibility for access to classified information \nor eligibility to hold a sensitive position. The new AGs supersede the Sept. 1, 2006 AGs \nand are effective \u201cfor all covered individuals\u201d on or after June 8, 2017. Accordingly, I \nhave evaluated Applicant\u2019s security clearance eligibility under the new AGs.2 \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nIn Applicant\u2019s answer to the SOR, he admitted a felony arrest for Pointing of a \nFirearm (SOR 1.a), which was also alleged under the personal conduct guideline. After \na thorough review of the pleadings and exhibits, I make the following findings of fact. \nApplicant is a 56-year-old flight engineer and project manager who has worked \nfor a defense contractor since August 2000 and seeks to retain his security clearance. \n(Ex. 1, Ex. E, Tr. 20) From September 1981 through September 1985, he honorably \nserved in the U.S. Air Force. (Ex. 1, Tr. 22) He had no overseas deployments when on \nactive duty, but spent three and a half years in Saudi Arabia with his contractor job. (Tr. \n24) He has been married 26 years and has no children. (Ex.1, Tr. 24) \n \nOn January 29, 2015, Applicant was arrested for felony pointing of a firearm. (Ex. \n5, Ex. A) That evening, his sleep was interrupted by his neighbor\u2019s four barking dogs. \n(Ex. B) Applicant lives in a gated community of 100 homes all on one-and-a-half acre \nlots. (Tr. 27) There was a history of complaints about the barking dogs. The dogs\u2019 \nbarking was loud enough to disturb one neighbor, not the Applicant, who lived six \nhundred feet away and the noise was separated from his residence by a heavily \nwooded yard. (Ex. B) The complaint dogs\u2019 owner put threatening notes on people\u2019s \n                                                                                                                                                                                           \nfor Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information (AG) effective within the DoD on September \n1, 2006. \n \n2 Application of the AGs that were in effect as of the issuance of the SOR would not change my decision \nin this case. The new AGs are available at http://ogc.osd.mil/doha/5220-6 R20170608.pdf. \n  \n\n \n3 \ndoors when a different neighbor complained about the barking. (Tr. 28) When \nApplicant\u2019s next-door neighbors complained to the dogs\u2019 owner about the noise, the \ndogs\u2019 owner dropped off a box fan at the complaining neighbor\u2019s home and said he \nheard \u201cwhite noise\u201d helps to reduce the sound of barking dogs. (Tr. 28)  \n \nSince 2012, the police had responded four times from complaints from the \nneighbors about the barking dogs. (Ex. 6) The barking dogs had resulted in Applicant\u2019s \nneighbor being ticketed for disturbing the peace. (Ex. B)The Applicant\u2019s neighbor had \ngone to court to respond to a complaint over his barking dogs and was fined by the city. \n(Tr. 28) As a result the owner frequently placed two of the dogs in a heated warehouse \nnear the house. (Ex. 6, Ex. B) The move failed to end the barking. (Ex. 6, Ex. B) \n \nThe back of Applicant\u2019s property fronts onto the dog owner\u2019s property. (Tr. 29) \nOn a previous occasion when Applicant\u2019s neighbor\u2019s dogs were constantly barking, \nApplicant called the police and was told the police would respond to loud party noise but \ndo not respond to animal disturbances. (Tr. 28) He was told that he would have to wait \nuntil the next morning to call animal control. (Tr. 28) Applicant stated the dogs would \nbark every two seconds for as long as eight hours straight. (Tr. 28)  \n \nOn January 29, 2015, at 8:20 pm, the dogs started barking. (Tr. 29) Applicant \nwent to the dog owner\u2019s home initially to leave a note complaining about the barking \ndogs. At that time, he did not know if anyone was home at the dog owner\u2019s home3. \nWhen the owner answered the door, Applicant angrily complained that the neighbor\u2019s \ndogs had kept Applicant awake the previous night. (Ex. 5) The owner initially said this \nwas the first time the dogs were barking, but later acknowledged he had failed to put the \ndogs in the barn the previous night. (Ex. B, Tr. 31) When Applicant challenged the \nowner about being fined after being taken to court over the dogs\u2019 barking, the owner \nbecame upset. (Tr. 31)  \n \nAfter Applicant stated his complaint, he returned to his car. At that time the dogs\u2019 \nowner followed him to his car. Both individuals were swearing. Applicant got into his car \nwhen the dogs\u2019 owner struck the hood of Applicant\u2019s car three times and dented the \nhood of Applicant\u2019s car. (Ex. 6, Tr. 17, Tr. 33)  \n \nThe individual\u2019s front house light was not working and the only light came from \nApplicant\u2019s car head lights. (Ex. 5, Ex. A, Tr. 16) At that time the neighbor had \nsomething metallic in his hand, which turned out to be a cell phone. But in the dark, \nApplicant could only identify it as metallic. (Tr. 16) Applicant got out of his car as his \nneighbor continued to approach him. Thinking the neighbor to be armed, as his \nneighbor approached, Applicant drew a handgun and pointed it at his neighbor yelling \nfor him to stop. Applicant has a concealed carry permit and says he drew his firearm out \nof self-defense. (Ex. 6) After exchanging additional words, Applicant got back in his car, \n                                                          \n3 Applicant stated that in his neighborhood individuals work nights or are sometime gone for multiple days due to \ntheir jobs so he did not know if the dog owner was home. (Tr. 30)  \n \n\n \n4 \ndrove home, and called the police. (Ex. 6) Three hours prior to the incident, Applicant \nhad a glass of wine with dinner. (Tr. 19)  \n \nThe dogs\u2019 owner said he followed Applicant to his car to make sure Applicant left. \n(Ex. 6) The dog owner says he messed up when he struck Applicant\u2019s vehicle, at which \ntime Applicant got out of his car. (Ex. 6) The dog owner told police he would have put \nhis dogs in the barn had Applicant asked. (Ex. 6) As Applicant was leaving, he said he \nwas going to call 911 and the dogs\u2019 owner said it would be a race to see who called \nfirst. The neighbor asked his wife to call 9-1-1 when he entered his home and to get his \nweapon. (Ex. B) Applicant called 911 when he got home, told the police about the \nincident, said he had drawn his weapon, and gave the police his address. (Tr. 33) He \nwas arrested that night and the gun confiscated. The gun was never returned to \nApplicant. (Tr. 39) His concealed carry permit was returned to the issuing authority. (Tr. \n50)  \n \nAfter the incident, the barking stopped. (Tr. 41) The dogs were rescue dogs and \nafter the newspaper article and television news about the incident, the dog rescue came \nand took the dogs from the home. (Tr. 41) Since the incident, Applicant has had no \ninteraction with the dogs\u2019 owner. (Tr. 41)  \n \nThe district attorney (DA) assigned to the case said he would drop the charges if \nApplicant wrote a letter of apology to the dogs\u2019 owner. (Tr. 36) Applicant refused to do \nso. The DA also suggested Applicant consider anger management or counseling. \nApplicant said he would go only if the dog owner also went. (Tr. 40) Two years later, a \ndifferent district attorney was handling the matter. Applicant initially paid his attorney \n$4,000 and was informed that an additional $8,000 would be required to take the matter \nto a jury trial, for a total of $12,000. (Tr. 9, SOR Response) The potential cost was a \nfactor in deciding to accept the district attorney\u2019s offer of a guilty plea to a misdemeanor. \nAlso a weighing factor was the stress the matter had caused Applicant and his wife. (Tr. \n36) When the plea was made, it had already cost him $7,0004. (Tr. 14, Tr. 36)  \n \nOn November 23, 2016, Applicant, after pleading guilty to the misdemeanor of \npointing a weapon at others, he was order to pay a $50 fine, a $50 Victim's \nCompensation Assessment (VCT), and $83 in court costs. His finding of guilty was \ndeferred for three years. (Ex. 4) He was required to complete one year of supervised \nprobation5 and two additional years of unsupervised probation. (Tr. 37) None of the \ncourt documents present in the record indicate a community service requirement. After \n                                                          \n4 In addition to the $4,000 attorney\u2019s fees, Applicant paid $50 for warrant of arrest, $25 for court \ninformation system revolving fund, $75 bond fee to the court (the bondsman\u2019s fee for the $4,000 bond is \nnot part of the record), and $200 in additional court fees and assessments. (Ex. 4) The bond was \ndecreased at arraignment. (Ex. 4) Applicant\u2019s cost between these fees, assessments, and costs and the \n$7,000 claimed by Applicant is not part of the record. \n  \n5 Even though there was one year of supervised probation, Applicant never saw the probation officer. \nWithin a week of his plea, he called the probation officer and was told he did not have to come in to the \nprobation office and that he should keep the probation officer informed if he moved, changed \nemployment, or if his telephone number changed.  \n\n \n5 \ncompleting the deferred sentence, Applicant\u2019s record would be expunged. (Tr. 14) \nWhen Applicant made the decision to plead guilty to the misdemeanor, he had no idea \nthat doing so would have affected his security clearance. (Tr. 14) \n \nAs of February 2018, Applicant had completed 130 hours of community service \nat a non-profit organization that helped neglected, abused, and homeless dogs. (Ex. D) \nThe president and founder of the organization stated Applicant was very hard working \nand a dedicated volunteer who always put in the best possible effort. (Ex. D) In May \n2018, Applicant had met all the conditions regarding the supervised probation and \ncommunity service, and having served more than half of the probationary period, \nformally requested early termination of his unsupervised probation.  \n \nIn January 2019, Applicant dismissed his original attorney and hired a new \nattorney, at a cost of an additional $4,000, in an attempt to terminate the unsupervised \nprobation early. On March 22, 2019, the Motion to Accelerate Deferred Sentence and \nDismiss Case was sustained. (Ex. V) On March 22, 2019, an Order of Dismissal was \nsigned, which ordered, adjudged, and decreed that the case against him be dismissed. \nNow that the deferred sentence has been successfully completed, his record will be \nexpunged. \n \nApplicant realizes he acted inappropriately and wishes he had never gone to the \ndogs\u2019 owner\u2019s home. The frustration due to lack of sleep and the police not responding \nto barking dogs contributed to his inappropriate actions. (Tr. 42) He makes no excuses \nfor his actions. His intent was to leave a note and when he saw the dogs\u2019 owner was \nhome, it was his intent to tell him to quiet his dogs, and then he intended to leave. (Tr. \n42) Obviously, it did not work out as planned. \n \nThe senior logistics manager for the DoD contractor was Applicant\u2019s supervisor \nfor two and a half years, and he described Applicant as a very dedicated, detailed, and \npassionate about the work he performs on aircraft upgrades. (Ex. E) He stated \nApplicant has strong morals that drive his decisions and highly recommends Applicant. \n(Ex. E) The project manager stated Applicant was one of the better project management \nspecialists in the company. (Ex. E) \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which must be considered in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n\n \n6 \n2(a), the adjudication process is an examination of a sufficient period and a careful \nweight of a number of variables of an individual\u2019s life to make an affirmative \ndetermination that the individual is an acceptable security risk. This is known as the \nwhole-person concept.  \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record.  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination of the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline J: Criminal Conduct \n \n \nThe security concern about criminal conduct is articulated in AG \u00b6 30: \n \nCriminal activity creates doubt about a person\u2019s judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person\u2019s ability \nor willingness to comply with laws, rules and regulations. \n \nAG \u00b6 31 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. The following disqualifying conditions are potentially applicable:  \n \n\n \n7 \n(a) a pattern of minor offenses, any one of which on its own would be \nunlikely to affect a national security eligibility decision, but which in \ncombination cast doubt on the individual\u2019s judgment, reliability, or \ntrustworthiness; and  \n  \n(b) evidence (including, but not limited to, a credible allegation, an \nadmission, and matters of official record) of criminal conduct, regardless of \nwhether the individual was formally charged, prosecuted, or convicted.  \n \n \nIn January 2015, Applicant was charged with carrying a firearm while under the \ninfluence and felony pointing a firearm. He pled no contest to a reduced misdemeanor \ncharge and received a deferred disposition. He was placed on probation for three years \nuntil November 2019. The disqualifying conditions in AG \u00b6 31 (a) applies. AG \u00b6 31(b) \ndoes not apply because there is no \u201cpattern\u201d of offenses\u2014he committed one offense. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 31(c), \u201cindividual is currently on parole or probation,\u201d was applicable as of \nthe issuance of the SOR in May 2017 because Applicant was then on unsupervised \nprobation. It no longer applies because he successfully petitioned for an Order of \nDismissal. He made a motion to accelerate the deferred sentence and dismiss his case. \nOn March 22, 2019, it was ordered, adjudged, and decreed that the case against him be \ndismissed.  \n \n \nApplicant has the burden of establishing the applicability of one or more of the \nmitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 32, which provide: \n \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur \nand does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or \ngood judgment; \n \n(b) the individual was pressured or coerced into committing the act and \nthose pressures are no longer present in the person\u2019s life; \n \n(c) no reliable evidence to support that the individual committed the \noffense; and  \n \n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including, but not limited \nto, the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, restitution, \ncompliance with the terms of parole or probation, job training or higher \neducation, \ngood \nemployment \nrecord, \nor \nconstructive \ncommunity \ninvolvement. \n \n \nApplicant has not been arrested since January 2015. He has demonstrated \nreform under AG \u00b6 32(d) by successfully completing his probation with no evidence of \nany violation over the four years. His conduct was the result of unusual circumstances. \n \n\n \n8 \nApplicant\u2019s neighbor had a problem with his barking dogs. The dogs barked \ncontinuously for long periods of time. The police had responded four times to complaints \nfrom various neighbors, the owner was ticketed for disturbing the peace, and went to \ncourt responding to a complaint over his barking dogs. He was fined by the city. The \ndogs were rescue dogs and after the newspaper article and television news report \nabout this incident, the dog rescue came and removed the dogs from the home.  \n \nApplicant had previously called the police about the barking, only to be told the \npolice would respond to loud party noise, but not to animal noise. When a different \nneighbor complained about the barking, the dogs\u2019 owner dropped off a fan to that \nneighbor suggesting that \u201cwhite noise\u201d would cover up the barking. When another \nneighbor complained, the dogs\u2019 owner put threatening notes on people\u2019s doors \nthroughout the neighborhood.  \n \nApplicant was kept awake by the barking. When the dogs started barking the \nfollowing night, Applicant went to the dog owner\u2019s home to leave a note complaining \nabout the barking. Applicant was unsure if anyone would be at the home. When the \nowner answered the door, Applicant confronted him about the barking. The dogs\u2019 owner \nlied saying this was the first time he had received a complaint about the barking. The \ndogs\u2019 owner became very upset when Applicant challenged the owner about his lie that \nhe had never received complaints about the dogs\u2019 barking. When Applicant stated he \nknew the owner had already been fined by the court for the barking, this further angered \nthe owner.  \n \nAfter Applicant stated his complaint, he returned to his car to leave. Both \nindividuals were very upset and swearing. Applicant got into his car when the dogs\u2019 \nowner struck the hood of Applicant\u2019s car numerous times denting the hood of \nApplicant\u2019s car. At that time, Applicant saw something in the owner\u2019s hand, but because \nthere was no porch light, Applicant could not tell what it was, only that it was metallic. It \nturned out to be a cell phone, but it is not uncommon that a homeowner in the state to \nleave their home with a handgun. \n \nApplicant showed poor judgment when he got out of his car as his neighbor \ncontinued to approach him. Thinking the neighbor to be armed, Applicant drew his \nhandgun and pointed it at his neighbor yelling for his neighbor to stop. After exchanging \nadditional words, Applicant got back in his car, drove home, called the police, gave the \npolice his address, and said he had drawn his weapon. Since the incident, Applicant \nhas had no interaction with the dogs\u2019 owner. \n \n The district attorney offered to dismiss the charges if Applicant wrote a letter of \napology to the dogs\u2019 owner. When Applicant refused to send the letter of apology, it cost \nhim $4,000 in attorney\u2019s fees plus additional expenses. Applicant decided to accept the \ndistrict attorney\u2019s offer of a misdemeanor when he was told it would cost an additional \n$8,000 to take the matter to court.  \n \n\n \n9 \nOn November 23, 2016, Applicant plead guilty to the misdemeanor of pointing a \nweapon at others, and he was ordered to pay small amounts: a $50 fine, a $50 VCA, \nand $83 in court costs. He successfully completed one year of supervised probation, \nand more than one year of his two year requirement of unsupervised probation. \nAdjudication of the finding of guilty was deferred for three years, which ended in March \n2019 with the Order of Dismissal. Now that the deferred sentence has been \nsuccessfully completed, his record will be expunged. When he made the decision to \nplead to the misdemeanor, he had no idea that doing so would affect his security \nclearance.  \n \n \nApplicant realizes he acted inappropriately and wishes he had never gone to the \ndogs\u2019 owner\u2019s home. The dogs\u2019 owner\u2019s previous actions in no way excuse Applicant\u2019s \nactions, but did give Applicant insight in what to expect from the dogs\u2019 owner. The \nfrustration due to lack of sleep and the police not responding to barking dogs \ncontributed to his inappropriate actions, but he makes no excuses for his actions. \n \nThe mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 32(a) apply as so much time has elapsed \nsince the criminal behavior happened and it happened under such unusual \ncircumstances, that it is unlikely to recur. The incident occurred in January 2015, more \nthan four years ago. The events of the evening are both unusual and unlikely to recur.  \n \n \nThe mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 32(b) apply. Applicant\u2019s lack of sleep from \nthe previous night and all the previous times of barking dogs was a pressure that is no \nlonger present in Applicant\u2019s life, now that the dogs have been removed from his \nneighbor\u2019s home. AG \u00b6 32(d) applies since it has been more than four years without \nrecurrence of criminal activity and Applicant complied with all court orders including his \n130 hours of community service at the dog shelter. His probation has ended and his \ndeferred sentence has been successfully completed. Applicant\u2019s has a good \nemployment record as evidenced by his senior logistics manager\u2019s opinion that \nApplicant is very dedicated, detailed, and passionate about the work he performs and is \none of the company\u2019s better project management specialists.  \n \nGuideline E: Personal Conduct \n \nThe concerns about personal conduct are set forth in AG \u00b6 15:  \n  \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information.  \n \nSOR \u00b6 2.a is a cross-allegation of the criminal conduct allegations in SOR \u00b6 1. \nThe security concerns associated with that conduct are largely addressed under \nGuideline J above. Nevertheless, AG \u00b6 16(d)(2) also applies. Applicant\u2019s arrests might \naffect his personal, professional, or community standing. AG \u00b6 16(e)(1) applies. \n\n \n10 \n AG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. The following disqualifying conditions are potentially applicable:  \n  \n(d) \ncredible adverse information that is not explicitly covered under any \nother single guideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an adverse \ndetermination, but which, when combined with all available information, \nsupports a whole-person assessment of questionable judgment, \nuntrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply \nwith rules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that the \nindividual may not properly safeguard classified or sensitive information. \nThis includes but is not limited to, consideration of: . . . (2) any disruptive, \nviolent, or other inappropriate behavior. \n  \nAG \u00b6 16(e)6 does not apply because following the incident there was a \nnewspaper article and television coverage of the incident. The incident does not cause \nApplicant to be vulnerable to exploitation, manipulation, or duress because it is known \nto the public.  \n \n  \nAG \u00b6 17 sets forth potentially applicable mitigating conditions under Guideline E:  \n \n(c) \nthe offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n  \n(d) \nthe individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, \nunreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to \nrecur; and \n  \n(e) \nthe individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate \nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress.  \n \n As previously stated, it has been more than four years since the incident and it \nhappened under unusual circumstances that are unlikely to recur. AG \u00b6 17(c) applies. \nAlthough Applicant has not received counseling, he acknowledged his behavior showed \npoor judgment, and in light of his neighbor\u2019s history of inappropriate and threatening \nconduct, he should never have gone to his neighbor\u2019s home. Now that the dogs have \nbeen removed from his neighbor\u2019s home the stressors and circumstances that \ncontributed to the inappropriate behavior is unlikely to recur. \n                                                          \n6 AG \u00b6 16(e) personal conduct, or concealment of information about one\u2019s conduct, that creates a \nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress by a foreign intelligence entity or other \nindividual or group. Such conduct includes: (1) engaging in activities which, if known, could affect \nthe person\u2019s personal, professional, or community standing.  \n\n \n11 \nAs previously stated, following the incident, a newspaper article and television \nnews report informed the public, which included his employer\u2019s security office, about his \narrest. This reduces or eliminates any ongoing vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation \nor duress stemming from his circumstances. AG \u00b6 17(e) applies. Applicant realizes he \nacted inappropriately and wishes he had never gone to the dogs\u2019 owner\u2019s home. The \nfrustration due to lack of sleep and the police not responding to barking dogs \ncontributed to his inappropriate actions, but he makes no excuses for his actions. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the \npotentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and \ncircumstances surrounding this case. My comments under Guidelines J and E are \nincorporated in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were \naddressed under those guidelines but some warrant additional comment. \n \nApplicant is 56 years old, and he has been employed by a DoD contractor as a \nflight engineer and project manager from August 2000 to present. He honorably served \nin the U.S. Air Force from 1981 through 1985. He had no overseas deployments while \non active duty, but spent three and a half years in Saudi Arabia with his contractor job. \n  \nA security clearance adjudication is an evaluation of an individual\u2019s judgment, \nreliability, and trustworthiness. Applicant realizes he acted inappropriately and wishes \nhe had never gone to the dogs\u2019 owner\u2019s home. The frustration due to lack of sleep and \nthe police not responding to barking dogs contributed to his inappropriate actions, but \nhe makes no excuses for his actions. Applicant made a number of mistakes related to \nthe incident, but the three biggest were: first, going to his neighbor\u2019s home to leave a \nnote about the barking dogs; second, pointing his gun at his neighbor; and, third, not \nwriting the letter of apology. Had he written the letter of apology, the DA would have \ndismissed the case. Applicant\u2019s decision not to write the letter cost him $4,000 for his \n\n \n12 \ninitial attorney, $4,000 for his second attorney, additional costs, stress, and a matter that \nstarted in January 2015 and came to a conclusion with the March 2019, Motion to \nDismiss. Applicant was reluctant to apologize for pointing a firearm at his neighbor \nbecause he believed that based on his knowledge of the facts and circumstances \npointing a firearm at his neighbor was warranted as self-defense. He should have \napologized because from his neighbor\u2019s perspective, his neighbor was threatened with \na firearm on his own property when he was unarmed.  \n \nI considered Applicant\u2019s service to the U.S. military, his current position, and that \nthis was a single, although serious, incident. His senior logistics manager, who was \nApplicant\u2019s supervisor for two and a half years, believes Applicant is very dedicated, \ndetailed, and passionate about the work he performs on aircraft upgrades. He believes \nApplicant has strong morals that drive his decisions and highly recommends Applicant. \nHis project manager believes Applicant is one of the better project management \nspecialists in the company. Applicant had completed 130 hours of community service at \na dog shelter and the president and founder of the shelter organization believes \nApplicant was very hard working and a dedicated volunteer who always put in the best \npossible effort.  \n \n Supervisors have many tasks, but two of the most important of their many tasks \nare: first, to accomplish the mission, and second, to evaluate those individuals assigned \nto them. A portion of their duties is to make sure the right people receive proper training, \nare assigned the right positions, and determine who should be promoted or remain with \nthe company. Their character evaluations are important and often more accurate \nbecause they have observed applicants over longer periods of time and under a variety \nof events and stresses. These supervisors are required to evaluate individuals and \ndescribe their performance, trustworthiness, reliability, and dedication. I place a great \ndeal of weight on the evaluations given by Applicant\u2019s senior logistics manager, project \nmanager, and the president and founder of the organization running the dog shelter, \nand rightly so. \n \nI have carefully applied the law, as set forth in Egan, Exec. Or. 10865, the \nDirective, DOD Manual 5200.02, and the AGs, to the facts and circumstances in the \ncontext of the whole person. The issue is whether this serious single incident raises \nconcerns about his fitness to hold a security clearance. (See AG & 2(c)) Overall, the \nrecord evidence leaves me without questions and doubts about Applicant\u2019s eligibility \nand suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant has \nmitigated the criminal conduct and personal conduct security concerns. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Criminal Conduct:  \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n\n \n13 \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \nParagraph 2, Personal Conduct:  \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant a security clearance. \nEligibility for access to classified information is granted.  \n \n \n \n_______________________ \nCLAUDE R.

The SOR also alleges that Applicant filed a Chapter 13 bankruptcy in September 2007 that was dismissed in November 2007, and that Applicant failed to file Federal and state tax returns when due for tax years 2009-2013. The SOR allegations are sufficiently supported by relevant evidence. Applicant\u2019s financial problems began during his first marriage and 2008 divorce. Applicant and his spouse filed a Chapter 13 bankruptcy in 2007 to reorganize about $30,000 in debts.

Cervi, Administrative Judge \nThis case involves security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial \nConsiderations). Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nStatement of the Case \nApplicant submitted a security clearance application (SCA) on June 9, 2015. On \nMay 18, 2017, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications Facility (DOD \nCAF) sent him a statement of reasons (SOR) alleging security concerns under Guideline \nF.1 Applicant answered the SOR and requested a hearing.\nThe case was assigned to me on May 7, 2018. The Defense Office of Hearings \nand Appeals (DOHA) issued a notice of hearing on June 11, 2018, scheduling the hearing \n1 The DOD CAF acted under Executive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \nIndustry (February 20, 1960), as amended; and DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel \nSecurity Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive). The Adjudicative \nGuidelines (AG) were revised effective June 8, 2017, and apply herein. \n01/15/2019\n\n \n2 \n \nfor July 10, 2018. The hearing was convened as scheduled. Government Exhibits (GE) 1 \nthrough 10 were admitted in evidence without objection. Applicant and a witness testified, \nand Applicant Exhibits (AE) A through E were admitted without objection. The record was \nheld open to July 27, 2018, for Applicant to submit additional documentation. He \nsubmitted AE F, consisting of an e-mail statement that was admitted without objection. \nDOHA received the hearing transcript (Tr.) on July 19, 2018. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant is a 46-year-old warehouse material expeditor, employed by a defense \ncontractor since 1998. He graduated from high school in 1991. He married in 1992 and \ndivorced in 2008. He again married in 2014. He has two adult children and one adult step-\nson. He served on active duty in the U.S. Army from 1992 to 1997, and was honorably \ndischarged. Applicant was previously granted a top secret security clearance with access \nto sensitive compartmented information in 2006, but it was revoked for financial concerns \nand denied by a DOHA Administrative Judge in 2013. \n \nThe SOR alleges Applicant is delinquent on nearly $20,000 in debts, including \nunpaid Federal income taxes for tax year 2015, and child support obligations. The SOR \nalso alleges that Applicant filed a Chapter 13 bankruptcy in September 2007 that was \ndismissed in November 2007, and that Applicant failed to file Federal and state tax returns \nwhen due for tax years 2009-2013. The SOR allegations are sufficiently supported by \nrelevant evidence. \n \nApplicant\u2019s financial problems began during his first marriage and 2008 divorce. \nApplicant and his spouse filed a Chapter 13 bankruptcy in 2007 to reorganize about \n$30,000 in debts. (Tr. 31) The bankruptcy was dismissed because Applicant\u2019s debt to \nincome ratio did not qualify for a Chapter 13 proceeding. (GE 3) He did not pursue a \nChapter 7 discharge. By 2013, Applicant again had nearly $30,000 in delinquent debts. \n(GE 10) He attributed these debts to medical expenses, his divorce in 2008, his former \nspouse\u2019s poor spending habits, and a decrease in work hours. After a 2013 DOHA \nhearing, Applicant was denied security eligibility based on his unmitigated delinquent \ndebts. \n \nApplicant failed to file his Federal and state income tax returns for tax years 2009 \nthrough 2013, when due. He later filed the delinquent returns, and owes the IRS \napproximately $4,000 in unpaid taxes, penalties, and interest from the 2015 tax year. At \nhis hearing in this case, Applicant admitted that his Federal and state income tax returns \nfor 2016 and 2017 were also past due and unfiled. In his post-hearing submission, \nApplicant did not provide evidence that these returns have been filed. He attributed his \nfailure to file tax returns on time to his inability to work with his former spouse regarding \nclaiming the children as dependents, and their efforts to reconcile. He also admitted that \nhe did not have sufficient money to pay taxes owed. He did not seek assistance from a \ntax preparer, and he has not arranged a payment plan with the IRS. \n \n\n \n3 \n \nAfter their divorce, Applicant and his ex-spouse reconciled and lived together from \nlate 2008 to 2011. They purchased a 2009 luxury vehicle together. His spouse kept the \nvehicle after they separated in 2011, and it was repossessed in 2012. Applicant is jointly \nresponsible for the debt. He noted that he contacted a debt collection agency in 2012 or \n2013, but was unable to renegotiate the debt which totals over $8,000. (SOR \u00b6 1.a)  He \nclaimed that subsequent contact with the agency showed they no longer held the debt. \nApplicant\u2019s 2017 credit report shows the debt became delinquent in 2011 and was \ncharged off. No post-hearing documentation was provided to show the current status of \nthe debt or Applicant\u2019s efforts to resolve it. \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.c is a $6,816 timeshare property debt, placed in collection with an agency \nin about 2015. Applicant admitted the debt, and stated that he has been making automatic \nmonthly payments from his bank account to resolve it. The debt no longer appears on his \n2016 or 2017 credit reports. \n \nApplicant is delinquent on a mortgage for rental property he owns. He stated that \nthe property is occupied, but he has been unable to catch up on his mortgage payments \nthat became delinquent in May 2017, when he used the funds to pay for maintenance of \nthe property. The debt is reported on his 2017 credit report as a past-due Veterans \nBenefits Administration mortgage. (SOR \u00b6 1.d) No post-hearing information was provided \nshowing the current status of the mortgage or efforts to resolve the past-due debt.  \n \nApplicant became delinquent on child-support obligations because of a \ndisagreement with his former spouse. (SOR \u00b6 1.e) His pay was involuntarily garnished in \n2016 or 2017, and released in July 2018 after the arrearage was paid. (AE F) This debt \nis resolved. \n \nApplicant has not sought financial counseling nor does he have a budget. He noted \nthat since his 2013 DOHA case, he controls his purchases and pays his debts. He has \nless than $1,200 in savings. His current supervisor testified to Applicant\u2019s trustworthiness \nand work ethic. He noted that Applicant is a family man who would never put himself in a \nnegative light in front of his children, and that his financial problems have not affected his \nwork. Several other co-workers also attested to his trustworthiness, reliability, dedication, \nexpertise and professionalism. \n \nLaw and Policies \n \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 2. \n \n\n \n4 \n \nNational security eligibility is predicated upon the applicant meeting the criteria \ncontained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. \nInstead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge applies \nthese guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative \njudge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider a person\u2019s stability, trustworthiness, reliability, \ndiscretion, character, honesty, and judgment. AG \u00b6 1(b). \n \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \n\u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \n \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 92-1106 at 3, \n1993 WL 545051 at *3 (App. Bd. Oct. 7, 1993). \n \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, \nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02- \n31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \n \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-\n20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 1(d). \n \n \n \n \n\n \n5 \n \nAnalysis \n \nFinancial Considerations \n \nThe security concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \n \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. . . .  \n \nThe relevant disqualifying conditions under AG \u00b6 19 include: \n \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; \n \n(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so; \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \n \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired. \n \nApplicant\u2019s admissions and the documentary evidence in the record supporting the \nSOR allegations are sufficient to establish the disqualifying conditions above. \n \nThe following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially relevant: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; \n\n \n6 \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue; and \n \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority \nto file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \n \nApplicant\u2019s tax delinquencies and other debts have been a long-standing, recurring \nproblem. Although he has been working full-time with his current employer since 1998, \nhe has not shown an ability to address delinquent debts, nor has he shown financial \nresponsibility. Applicant\u2019s on-again off-again relationship with his former spouse does not \nexcuse his failure to file income tax returns when due, and his failure to arrange payment \nof a 2015 past-due income-tax debt is inexcusable. The evidence shows that Applicant \nhas not made diligent efforts to resolve his debts, and the only resolved matter, delinquent \nchild support obligations, occurred through an involuntary garnishment order. Although \nhe has now filed his 2009 through 2013 tax returns, he admitted that his 2016 and 2017 \nFederal and state returns were not filed when due, and he has not shown that they have \nbeen filed since his hearing. Additionally, he has not sought financial counseling or \nprofessional assistance with his debts and tax obligations. \n \nOverall, I find that Applicant has continued his long-standing financial \nirresponsibility, and has not adequately addressed his delinquent debts. I find that his \nfinancial status is not under control and that similar problems are likely to recur. No \nmitigating conditions fully apply. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6\u00b6 2(a), 2(c), and 2(d), the ultimate determination of whether to grant \nnational security eligibility must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. Under the whole-person \nconcept, the administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security \nclearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process \nfactors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d).2 Although adverse information concerning a single criterion \nmay not be sufficient for an unfavorable eligibility determination, the individual may be \nfound ineligible if available information reflects a recent or recurring pattern of \nquestionable judgment, irresponsibility, or unstable behavior. AG \u00b6 2(e). \n \n                                                     \n2 (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to \ninclude knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age \nand maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence \nor absence of rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or \nrecurrence. \n\n \n7 \n \nI considered all of the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of \nall the facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my findings of \nfact and comments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. Applicant\u2019s long \nhistory of financial irresponsibility despite a long-standing work history has not been \nmitigated. His military service and difficulties with personal relationships do not overcome \nhis financial irresponsibility. Given his past efforts to keep and attain a security clearance, \nthe Government\u2019s expectations for financial responsibility should have been clear. \nWhether Applicant\u2019s actions with regard to his finances amount to simple inattention or \nnegligence, he has clearly not heeded that knowledge. \n \nAccordingly, I conclude Applicant has not carried his burden of showing that it is \nclearly consistent with the national security interests of the United States to grant him \neligibility for access to classified information. \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraphs 1.b, 1.c, and 1.e:   \n \nFor Applicant \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a; 1.d, 1.f \u2013 1.h: \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national security interests of the \nUnited States to grant Applicant eligibility for access to classified information.

Eligibility for a security clearance is denied. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nOn October 1, 2015, Applicant applied for a security clearance and submitted an \nElectronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing (e-QIP) version of a Security \nClearance Application. On March 9, 2017, the Department of Defense (DOD) \nConsolidated Adjudications Facility (CAF) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to him, \nunder Executive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \nIndustry (February 20, 1960), as amended and modified; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense \nIndustrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended \nand modified (Directive); and the Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility For \nAccess to Classified Information (December 29, 2005) applicable to all adjudications and \nother determinations made under the Directive, effective September 1, 2006.1 \n                                                          \n \n  12/11/2018\n\n  \n  \n2  \n                                        \nThe SOR alleged security concerns under Guideline F (Financial Considerations), \nand detailed reasons why the DOD adjudicators were unable to find that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant. \nThe SOR recommended referral to an administrative judge to determine whether a \nclearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked.  \n \n \nApplicant received the SOR on March 31, 2017. In a notarized statement, dated \nApril 17, 2017, Applicant responded to the SOR and requested a hearing before an \nadministrative judge. Department Counsel indicated the Government was prepared to \nproceed on May 5, 2017. The case was initially assigned to another administrative judge \nin June 2017, but was eventually reassigned to me on March 20, 2018.  A Notice of \nHearing was issued on August 28, 2018. I convened the hearing as scheduled on \nSeptember 25, 2018. \n \n \nDuring the hearing, Government exhibits (GE) 1 through GE 4, and Applicant \nexhibits (AE) A through AE G were admitted into evidence without objection. Applicant \ntestified. The transcript (Tr.) was received on October 4, 2018. I kept the record open to \nenable Applicant to supplement it. He took advantage of that opportunity and timely \nsubmitted several documents, which were marked and admitted as AE H through AE Z, \nwithout objection. The record closed on October 30, 2018. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nIn his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted with comments all of the factual \nallegations pertaining to financial considerations of the SOR (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a. through 1.e.). \nApplicant\u2019s admissions and comments are incorporated herein as findings of fact. After a \ncomplete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, and upon due consideration \nof same, I make the following additional findings of fact:  \n \nApplicant is a 54-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has been serving \nas an information systems service operations manager since around 1994 with a business \nunit of one company that was eventually purchased by another company. A 1981 high \nschool graduate, Applicant earned some college credits, but no degree. He enlisted in the \nU.S. Air Force in August 1981, and he served on active duty until he was honorably \ndischarged in December 1991 as a Staff Sergeant (E-5). He was granted a secret \nclearance in 1981, and has retained that clearance except for periods when he possessed \na top secret clearance with access to Sensitive Compartmented Information (SCI). \nApplicant was married in July 1985, separated in August 2012, and divorced in December \n2016. He started cohabiting in September 2014, and in October 2017, he was again \nmarried. He has two daughters, born in 1991 and 2001. \n                                                          \n1 Effective June 8, 2017, by Directive 4 of the Security Executive Agent (SEAD 4), dated December \n10, 2016, National Security Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) for all covered individuals who require initial or \ncontinued eligibility for access to classified information or eligibility to hold a sensitive position, were \nestablished to supersede all previously issued national security adjudicative criteria or guidelines. \nAccordingly, those guidelines previously implemented on September 1, 2006, under which this security \nclearance review case was initiated, no longer apply. In comparing the two versions, there is no substantial \ndifference that might have a negative effect on Applicant in this case. \n \n\n  \n  \n3  \n                                        \nMilitary Service, Awards, and Decorations  \n  \nDuring his military service, Applicant was deployed from August 1990 until \nFebruary 1991 in support of Operations Desert Shield/Desert Storm. He was awarded \nthe Air Force Commendation Medal, the Joint Service Achievement Medal, the Air Force \nAchievement Medal, the Joint Meritorious Unit Award, the Air Force Outstanding Unit \nAward, the Air Force Good Conduct Medal (with two clusters), the National Defense \nService Medal, the Air Force Overseas Short Tour Ribbon, the Air Force Overseas Long \nTour Ribbon, the Air Force Longevity Service Award Ribbon, the Non-Commissioned \nOfficer Professional Military Education Graduate Ribbon, the Small Arms Expert \nMarksmanship Ribbon, and the Air Force Training Ribbon.2  \n \n Financial Considerations3 \n  \nApplicant attributed his financial difficulties to several different issues that initially \narose in or about mid-2012: he and his wife separated, leading to a lengthy and costly \ndivorce; he was required to maintain two households during the period of separation; he \nwas ordered to pay child support and alimony; his employer was unsuccessful in re-\ncompeting  on a contract, and he was initially issued a layoff notice; he was subsequently \noffered a new position with the same employer which required that he relocate, at his own \nexpense, to a different state;4 and although his primary residence was on the market for \nover six months, it did not sell. Because of the additional unexpected expenses, \ninsufficient funds caused him to fall behind on his mortgage. Although Applicant \nattempted to obtain mortgage relief through the Home Affordable Modification Program \n(HAMP) in August 2015,5 and offered to include a deed-in-lieu of foreclosure, nothing \nworked, and the property was eventually foreclosed.  \nThe SOR identified five purportedly delinquent accounts that had been placed for \ncollection, charged off, or foreclosed as generally reflected by Applicant\u2019s November 2015 \ncredit report or December 2016 credit report. Those debts total approximately $272,220. \nThe current status of those accounts, is as follows.  \n (SOR \u00b6 1.a.): This is a bank-issued home mortgage loan with a high credit of \n$261,506 and an unpaid balance of $244,414 (of which $11,726 was past due), that was \n                                                          \n2 AE H (Certificate of Release or Discharge from Active Duty (DD Form 214), dated December 11, \n1991). \n  \n3 General source information pertaining to the financial accounts discussed below can be found in \nthe following exhibits: GE 1 (e-QIP, dated October 1, 2015); GE 2 (Personal Subject Interview, dated \nJanuary 7, 2016); GE 3 (Combined Experian, TransUnion, and Equifax Credit Report, dated November 10, \n2015); GE 4 (Equifax Credit Report, dated December 20, 2016); and Applicant\u2019s Answer to the SOR, dated \nApril 17, 2017.   \n  \n4 AE C (Notification of Layoff and associated documents, various dates). \n \n5 AE B (HAMP Application and Related Papers, various dates). \n \n\n  \n  \n4  \n                                        \neventually sold at foreclosure in June 2016.6 Although there was an in personam \ndeficiency judgment balance of $24,777 against Applicant as of October 20, 2016, the \namount was considered by the court to be a marital debt to be paid by Applicant and his \nex-wife.7 Applicant stopped making his monthly payments in July 2015, in anticipation of \na layoff, has not yet made any payments on this account after the foreclosure because \nhe supposedly had insufficient funds to do so,8 and his ex-wife has avoided paying her \nshare by filing a petition for bankruptcy under Chapter 7 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code.9 \nThe account has not been resolved. \n \n(SOR \u00b6 1.b.): This is a bank-issued line of credit with an unpaid and past-due \nbalance of $27,059 that was placed for collection and charged off in 2016.10 As with the \nhome mortgage loan, the amount was considered by the court to be a marital debt to be \npaid by Applicant and his ex-wife.11 Applicant\u2019s ex-wife has avoided paying her share by \nfiling a petition for bankruptcy under Chapter 7 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. Applicant \ninitially contended that he had entered into an agreement with a particular company that \npurchased the account,12 but that payment agreement to which he refers is a credit-card \naccount with the same creditor, in the amount of $11,674, that was not alleged in the \nSOR, which was also considered to be a marital debt to be paid by both Applicant and \nhis ex-wife.13 Although he said he would reach out to the creditor in an effort to set up \nrepayment arrangements,14 to date, he has offered no evidence that he has done so.15 \nThe account has not been resolved. \n \n(SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c. through 1.e.): These are three medical accounts with unpaid \nbalances of $430, $195, and $122 that were placed for collection.16 Applicant paid the \nlargest and the smallest accounts, for a total of $553, in April 2017,17 and he paid the \n                                                          \n6 GE 3, supra note 3, at 6; GE 4, supra note 3, at 2; AE A (Report of Mediation, dated March 4, \n2016). \n \n7 AE A, supra note 6. \n \n8 Tr. at 34-36. \n \n9 AE L (Notice of Chapter 7 Bankruptcy Case, dated April 25, 2017); Tr. at 37. \n \n10 GE 3, supra note 3, at 6; GE 4, supra note 3, at 2; AE A, supra note 6. \n \n11 AE A, supra note 6. \n \n12 Tr. at 40.

His divorce decree identified the joint bank-issued credit card with \nan unpaid balance of $11,674 which was referred to above for which there is a payment \nplan calling for preauthorized monthly payments of $121.60 commencing in April 2017;20 \nand there is a bank-issued credit card in his ex-wife\u2019s name, also considered a marital \ndebt, with an unpaid balance of $21,438.21 Applicant referred to other credit cards for both \nhis ex-wife and himself for which he was making payments, and that he managed to get \none account paid off. He submitted documentation to support his position that one such \npast-due account for $2,769 was settled in August 2018 when he paid $830,22 but he \nfailed to submit documentation, such as receipts, letters, cancelled checks, or account \nstatements reflecting either continuing monthly payments or payment plans. \nAlthough Applicant has \u201cdefinitely been thinking about\u201d financial counseling, he has \nnever had it.23 During the hearing, Applicant said his current annual salary was over \n$120,000.24 After the hearing, he submitted a Personal Financial Statement reflecting a \nmonthly net income of $7,237; monthly expenses of $5,281; with a monthly remainder of \n$1,290 that might be available for discretionary spending or savings.25 However, based \non the figures furnished by Applicant, his actual annual salary is approximately \n$125,000.26 Among the debts listed in his Personal Financial Statement, Applicant \nindicated that he was making monthly payments on four of his current wife\u2019s accounts, \n                                                          \n18 AE F (Payment Information, dated February 22, 2017). \n \n19 Unalleged conduct can be considered for certain purposes, as discussed by the DOHA Appeal \nBoard. (Conduct not alleged in an SOR may be considered: (a) to assess an applicant's credibility; (b) to \nevaluate an applicant's evidence of extenuation, mitigation, or changed circumstances; (c) to consider \nwhether an applicant has demonstrated successful rehabilitation; (d) to decide whether a particular \nprovision of the Adjudicative Guidelines is applicable; or (e) to provide evidence for whole-person analysis \nunder Directive \u00a7 6.3.).

Instead, acknowledging the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. The entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known \nas the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a meaningful decision. \n \nIn the decision-making process, facts must be established by \u201csubstantial \nevidence.\u201d33 The Government initially has the burden of producing evidence to establish \na potentially disqualifying condition under the Directive, and has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Once the Government has produced \nsubstantial evidence of a disqualifying condition, under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant \nhas the burden of persuasion to present evidence in refutation, explanation, extenuation \nor mitigation, sufficient to overcome the doubts raised by the Government\u2019s case. The \nburden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government.34  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours as well. It is \nbecause of this special relationship that the Government must be able to repose a high \ndegree of trust and confidence in those individuals to whom it grants access to classified \ninformation. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the \napplicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. Such \ndecisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather \nthan actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Furthermore, \u201csecurity clearance \ndeterminations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d35  \n \nClearance decisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense \nbe a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d36 Thus, nothing in this \ndecision should be construed to suggest that I have based this decision, in whole or in \npart, on any express or implied determination as to Applicant\u2019s allegiance, loyalty, or \n                                                          \n33 \u201cSubstantial evidence [is] such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as \nadequate to support a conclusion in light of all contrary evidence in the record.\u201d  ISCR Case No. 04-11463 \nat 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2006) (citing Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1).  \u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla \nbut less than a preponderance.\u201d  See v. Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. \n1994). \n \n34 See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \n \n35 Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n \n36 See Exec.

It is merely an indication the Applicant has or has not met the strict guidelines \nthe President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a clearance.  In \nreaching this decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, \nand based on the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing \ninferences grounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations  \n  \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG \u00b6 18:        \n  \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage.  \n  \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19:   \n  \n(a) inability to satisfy debts;  \n  \n(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so;  \n  \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and  \n  \n(e) consistent spending beyond one\u2019s means or frivolous or irresponsible \nspending, which may be indicated by excessive indebtedness, significant \nnegative cash flow, a history of late payments or of non-payment, or other \nnegative financial indicators.  \n  \nA home mortgage was foreclosed in 2016, leaving a deficiency balance of \n$24,777; a line of credit in the amount of $27,069 was charged off in 2016; and three \nmedical accounts were placed for collection. Because Applicant and his ex-wife were \njointly responsible for the mortgage and line of credit, and she filed for bankruptcy under \nChapter 7 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code to avoid her financial responsibility, Applicant has \nbeen reluctant, if not unwilling, to satisfy those debts regardless of the ability to do so. He \n\n \n9 \n                                      \n \nclaimed to have insufficient funds to make payments on several accounts. AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) \n19(b), 19(c), and 19(e) have been established.  \n     \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns arising from financial difficulties under AG \u00b6 20:  \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;37 \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts;38 and \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue. \n \n                                                          \n37 A debt that became delinquent several years ago is still considered recent because \u201can \napplicant\u2019s ongoing, unpaid debts evidence a continuing course of conduct and, therefore, can be viewed \nas recent for purposes of the Guideline F mitigating conditions.\u201d ISCR Case No. 15-06532 at 3 (App. Bd. \nFeb. 16, 2017) (citing ISCR Case No. 15-01690 at 2 (App. Bd. Sep. 13, 2016)). \n \n38 The Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a good-faith effort to repay overdue \ncreditors or otherwise resolve debts: \n \nIn order to qualify for application of [the \u201cgood-faith\u201d mitigating condition], an applicant must \npresent evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or some \nother good-faith action aimed at resolving the applicant\u2019s debts. The Directive does not \ndefine the term \u2018good-faith.\u2019 However, the Board has indicated that the concept of good-\nfaith \u2018requires a showing that a person acts in a way that shows reasonableness, prudence, \nhonesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.\u2019 Accordingly, an applicant must do more than \nmerely show that he or she relied on a legally available option (such as bankruptcy [or \nstatute of limitations]) in order to claim the benefit of [the \u201cgood-faith\u201d mitigating condition].  \n \n(internal citation and footnote omitted) ISCR Case No. 02-30304 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2004) (quoting \nISCR Case No. 99-9020 at 5-6 (App. Bd. June 4, 2001)). \n \n\n \n10 \n                                      \n \nI have concluded that \u00b6 20(b) partially applies, and none of the other conditions \napply. The nature, frequency, and recency of Applicant\u2019s continuing financial difficulties \nmake it difficult to conclude that they occurred so long ago or were so infrequent, or that \nthey were unlikely to recur. In fact, they continue to this day. Applicant attributed his \nfinancial problems to several different factors: his lengthy separation and eventual \ndivorce; maintaining two households during the period of separation; he was ordered to \npay child support and alimony; after being notified of a layoff, he was offered a new \nposition with the same employer which required that he relocate, at his own expense, to \na different state; and although his primary residence was on the market for over six \nmonths, it did not sell. The significance of those factors has not been satisfactorily \nsupported by appropriate documentation. Applicant did go through a lengthy separation \nand divorce. Paying child support and alimony to the woman to whom he was married for \nnearly three decades would not be unexpected, in-as-much he would have been \nresponsible for them had the separation and divorce not occurred. While he was notified \nof an expected layoff, he was never actually terminated, and instead, he moved to a \ndifferent position where his salary was increased. \nAlthough Applicant\u2019s annual salary has been over $100,000 for several years, and \nis currently at $125,000, he has made little, if any, efforts to address his delinquent \naccounts until after he was motivated to do so upon receipt of the SOR. He stopped \nmaking his monthly mortgage payments in July 2015. He has ignored the deficiency since \nthe house was foreclosed and sold at public auction, and he has also ignored the line of \ncredit. Instead, Applicant made one extremely modest payment of $195 for a delinquent \nmedical account, one year after he was interviewed by the OPM investigator, and only \nmonths before the SOR was issued. He made two other relatively modest payments of \n$430 and $122 after the SOR was issued. An applicant who begins to resolve his financial \nproblems only after being placed on notice that his or her security clearance is in jeopardy \nmay be lacking in the judgment and self-discipline to follow rules and regulations over \ntime or when the is no immediate threat to his or her own interests.39 There is evidence \nof a repayment plan on a credit card not alleged in the SOR, but aside from the \nagreement, there is no evidence of any payments. With a substantial monthly remainder, \nApplicant could have started making payments on the mortgage deficiency and the line \nof credit well before the SOR was issued, but instead, he has made no efforts to do so. \nApplicant\u2019s minimal efforts to resolve his delinquent accounts, or at least his portion of \nthose accounts do not qualify as good-faith efforts. His promised intentions to reach out \nto his creditors, at this late date, are simply insufficient.40  \n                                                          \n                                                          \n39 See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 17-01213 at 5 (App. Bd. Jun. 29, 2018); ISCR Case No. 17-00569 at \n3-4 (App. Bd. Sept. 18, 2018). \n \n40 The Appeal Board has indicated that promises to pay off delinquent debts in the future was not \na substitute for a track record of paying debts in a timely manner and otherwise acting in a financially \nresponsible manner. ISCR Case No. 07-13041 at 4 (App. Bd. Sep. 19, 2008) (citing ISCR Case No. 99-\n0012 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 1, 1999)). \n \n\n \n11 \n                                      \n \nClearance decisions are aimed at evaluating an applicant\u2019s judgment, reliability, \nand trustworthiness. They are not a debt-collection procedure. The guidelines do not \nrequire an applicant to establish resolution of every debt or issue alleged in the SOR. An \napplicant needs only to establish a plan to resolve financial problems and take significant \nactions to implement the plan. There is no requirement that an applicant immediately \nresolve issues or make payments on all delinquent debts simultaneously, nor is there a \nrequirement that the debts or issues alleged in an SOR be resolved first. Rather, a \nreasonable plan and concomitant conduct may provide for the payment of such debts, or \nresolution of such issues, one at a time.   \nWhile there is evidence that Applicant never received financial counseling, \nApplicant\u2019s financial situation is sound on one hand, with a good salary and a substantial \nmonthly remainder, but, on the other hand, he is ignoring his delinquent debts.  \nApplicant\u2019s actions under the circumstances cast doubt on his current reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and good judgment.41  \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6 2(d): \n  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nUnder SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. Moreover, I have \nevaluated the various aspects of this case in light of the totality of the record evidence \nand have not merely performed a piecemeal analysis.42  \n  \nThere is some evidence in favor of mitigating Applicant\u2019s conduct. Applicant is a \n54-year-old employee of a defense contractor, serving as an information systems service \noperations manager since around 1994 with a business unit of one company that was \neventually purchased by another company. Co-workers think highly of him. He served on \n                                                          \n41 See ISCR Case No. 09-08533 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Oct. 6, 2010).  \n  \n42 See U.S. v. Bottone, 365 F.2d 389, 392 (2d Cir. 1966); See also ISCR Case No. 03-22861 at 2-\n3 (App. Bd. Jun. 2, 2006). \n \n\n \n12 \n                                      \n \nactive duty with the U.S. Air Force for ten years until he was honorably discharged in \n1991. He was granted a secret clearance in 1981, and has retained that clearance except \nfor periods when he possessed a top secret clearance with SCI access. Since his financial \ndifficulties commenced, he made minimal payments to resolve three medical debts. \nThe disqualifying evidence under the whole-person concept is more substantial. \nAlthough Applicant\u2019s annual salary has been over $100,000 for several years, and is \ncurrently at $125,000, he has made little, if any, efforts to address his delinquent accounts \nuntil after he was motivated to do so upon receipt of the SOR. He stopped making his \nmonthly mortgage payments in July 2015. He has ignored the $24,777 deficiency since \nthe house was foreclosed and sold at public auction, and he has also ignored the $27,059 \nline of credit. In addition, there are non-SOR delinquent debts for $11,674 and $21,438. \nApplicant made one extremely modest payment of $195 for a delinquent medical account, \none year after he was interviewed by the OPM investigator, and only months before the \nSOR was issued. \nThe Appeal Board has addressed a key element in the whole-person analysis in \nfinancial cases stating:43 \nIn evaluating Guideline F cases, the Board has previously noted that the \nconcept of \u201cmeaningful track record\u201d necessarily includes evidence of actual \ndebt reduction through payment of debts. However, an applicant is not \nrequired, as a matter of law, to establish that he [or she] has paid off each \nand every debt listed in the SOR. All that is required is that an applicant \ndemonstrate that he [or she] has \u201c. . . established a plan to resolve his [or \nher] financial problems and taken significant actions to implement that plan.\u201d \nThe Judge can reasonably consider the entirety of an applicant\u2019s financial \nsituation and his [or her] actions in evaluating the extent to which that \napplicant\u2019s plan for the reduction of his outstanding indebtedness is credible \nand realistic. See Directive \u00b6 E2.2(a) (\u201cAvailable, reliable information about \nthe person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, should be \nconsidered in reaching a determination.\u201d) There is no requirement that a \nplan provide for payments on all outstanding debts simultaneously. Rather, \na reasonable plan (and concomitant conduct) may provide for the payment \nof such debts one at a time. Likewise, there is no requirement that the first \ndebts actually paid in furtherance of a reasonable debt plan be the ones \nlisted in the SOR. \nApplicant has demonstrated an extremely poor track record of debt reduction and \nelimination efforts. Overall, the evidence leaves me with substantial questions and doubts \nas to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all of these reasons, \nI conclude Applicant has failed to mitigate the security concerns arising from his financial \nconsiderations. See SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6\u00b6 2(d)(1) through AG 2(d)(9). \n \n \n                                                          \n43 ISCR Case No. 07-06482 at 2-3 (App. Bd.

He denied 7 of the 12 SOR \nallegations and admitted the others with explanations. He denied the falsification \nallegation in SOR \u00b6 2.a. Applicant also requested a hearing before an administrative \njudge. The case was assigned to another administrative judge in May 2017 and \ntransferred to me on October 16, 2017. On January 18, 2019, the Defense Office of \n03/05/2019\n\n \n2 \n \nHearings and Appeals (DOHA) notified Applicant that the video teleconference hearing \n(VTC) hearing was scheduled for February 7, 2019. I convened the VTC hearing as \nscheduled.  \n \nGovernment Exhibits (GE) 1 through 8 were admitted into evidence without \nobjection. I left the record open at Applicant\u2019s request until February 21, 2019, and he \nprovided several post-hearing documents by email of February 13, 2019, that were \ncollectively marked as Applicant\u2019s Exhibit (AE) A and admitted without objection. On \nFebruary 21, 2019, Applicant provided more supplemental documents that were \ncollectively marked as AE B and admitted without objection. DOHA received the \ntranscript (Tr.) on February 21, 2019.  \n \n  Findings of Fact1 \n \nApplicant is 57 years old. He graduated from high school in 1979 and had some \ncollege. Applicant enlisted in the U.S. Navy in 1979 and served honorably for 14 years \nbefore accepting a voluntary separation incentive to retire early as a senior chief petty \nofficer (E-8). He served as an electronics technician, including submarine duty, and \nparticipated in Operation Desert Shield in 1990. Applicant earned numerous awards \nincluding four Navy Achievement Medals (NAMs) for his service. (Tr. 26-27) He has \nbeen married three times: 1979 to 1986; 2003 to 2005; and presently since 2014. He \nreported three adult-children by his first wife. Applicant has been employed as a project \nmanager for a federal contractor since 2008. He has worked for federal contractors, with \na security clearance, for over 25 years without infractions. (Tr. 22) Applicant travels 95% \nof the time for his job. (Tr. 23)  \n  \nThe SOR alleges 12 delinquent debts totaling approximately $26,571, including a \npast-due second mortgage on his primary residence in the amount of $14,681 at SOR \u00b6 \n1.i. The SOR also alleges three delinquent medical debts, utility and credit-card debts. \nApplicant did not disclose any of these delinquencies in section 26 (Financial Record) of \nhis SCA. (GE 1)   \n \nApplicant\u2019s credit reports reflect that he obtained a primary mortgage in the \napproximate amount of $148,000 in March 2006. (GE 2) At the same time, he obtained \na home equity loan or second mortgage in the amount of $37,000. Both loans were \ntransferred several times, and Applicant has continuously paid his primary mortgage as \nagreed. (GE 2\u20136) His 2014 credit report indicates that the second mortgage was past \ndue in the amount of $14,681, and the last activity on the account was in December \n2011 before it was closed and transferred. (GE 2) A real property transaction record \nconcerning his primary residence, reflects that at some point the second mortgage was \n                                                          \n1 Unless stated otherwise, the source of the information in this section is Applicant\u2019s July 9, 2014 security \nclearance application (SCA) and the summaries of his security clearance interviews on February 17, \n2015, and November 1, 2016. \n \n\n \n3 \n \ntransferred to Countrywide Mortgage Company.2 (GE 7) It fell off Applicant\u2019s later credit \nreports without explanation. (GE 5-6)  \n \nIn his personal subject interview (PSI) with a clearance investigator in February \n2015, Applicant stated he had been making payments of $350 per month on the second \nmortgage when he fell behind on payments. (GE 8) He tried to negotiate, but the \ncreditor wanted payment of the full $14,681 due, and he could not afford to pay that. \nApplicant testified credibly that since then, the second mortgage (SOR \u00b6 1.i) was \ntransferred and he has made multiple phone calls to try to discern the present creditor \nholding that loan, to no avail. (Tr. 53-54) He fell behind on payments because he had a \nheart attack in 2011. He was disabled, and out of work, for six months. (Tr. 33, 55) The \ncreditor stopped communicating with Applicant. He testified that he refinanced his \nprimary residence in August 2018 without problems and there was no mention of the \nsecond mortgage by his present lender. (Tr. 57-60) Applicant corroborated this by \nproviding supplemental, post-hearing documents including a closing disclosure \nstatement showing a payoff of $124,195 to the previous mortgagee and no reference to \nany second mortgagee.3 (AE A)  \n \n SOR \u00b6 1.a is for a medical debt placed for collection in the amount of $2,229. \nApplicant testified that this was a result of an ambulance ride required to transport him \nbetween hospitals after his heart attack. (Tr. 37) He felt that the total ambulance bill of \n$4,000 was exorbitant for a short ride. Nonetheless, he is now in a payment plan and \nmaking monthly payments of $150 per month on this debt. (AE A) SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c and 1.d \nare also medical debts placed for collection by the same creditor as a result of co-\npayments that were not covered by Applicant\u2019s medical insurance. These have been \npaid in full. (Tr. 39-40, AE A, GE 5) Applicant testified that the charged-off debt for $242 \nat SOR \u00b6 1.b was for the purchase of a horse trailer. (Tr. 38) It was paid in full in May \n2017. (AE A)  \n \nApplicant testified that the debt placed for collection in the amount of $1,077 at \nSOR \u00b6 1.e was disputed with the three major credit-reporting-bureaus as it is not his \ncredit-card debt. (Tr. 40-41) He researched the matter and made phone calls to the \noriginal creditor (bank). Applicant provided post-hearing documentation that the creditor \nwas unable to substantiate these debts and no longer considers them valid collection \naccounts. (Tr. 42, AE B) Applicant was overseas for extended periods of time for his \njob, and he admits that he did not check his credit reports for about 10 years. (GE 8) He \n                                                          \n2 This disgraced mortgage-lender was \u201cat the epicenter of the mortgage meltdown that in 2008 brought \nthe nation\u2019s economy to its knees.\u201d (N.Y. Times, June 24, 2016 article) John Leibowitz, Chairman of the \nFederal Trade Commission was quoted \u201cIts business model was based on deceit and corruption, and the \nharm caused to the American consumer is absolutely massive and extraordinary.\u201d  Countrywide was a \nsubsidiary of Bank of America (BOA). The U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) reached a $16.65 Billion civil \nsettlement with BOA in 2014 for systematic mortgage fraud \u2013 the largest civil settlement against a single \nentity in American history. See DOJ Office of Public Affairs press release dated August 21, 2014 \u2013 Bank \nof America to pay $16.65 Billion in Historic Settlement for Financial Fraud Leading up to an during the \nFinancial Crisis. \n \n3 I infer that a proper title search was completed before this closing in compliance with prevailing real-\nestate law and practices.  \n\n \n4 \n \ntold the clearance investigator he was not aware of the credit-card debts and he ignored \nsome debts. He has an active account with the creditor at SOR \u00b6 1.e. He testified that \nthe same status applies to the creditor in SOR \u00b6 1.g ($1,466) and \u00b6 1.l ($4,419), which \nare for a credit-card debt placed for collection in the amount of $4,419 and an account \nplaced for collection for $1,466. These were effectively disputed and the creditor no \nlonger considers them to be valid debts. (AE B)  \n \nThe credit-card debt placed for collection by a bank at SOR \u00b6 1.h was also \neffectively disputed to the three credit bureaus, and the creditor no longer considers it a \nvalid debt. (AE B) This was a credit card for a home-improvement store. (GE 8) The \ndebt placed for collection by a telecommunication company in the amount of $197 at \nSOR \u00b6 1.f has been paid in full. (GE 5-6) The retail store debt placed for collection in the \namount of $1,157 at SOR \u00b6 1.j was compromised and settled for $354. (AE A) The \ndelinquent phone bill at SOR \u00b6 1.k for $296 was paid in full in July 2014. (AE A, Tr. 46) \nThe debt placed for collection by a bank in the amount of $1,466 at SOR \u00b6 1.l was for a  \ncomputer that Applicant never received. (GE 8) He disputes this debt.  \n \nApplicant testified that he had a salary of $135,000 to 140,000 in 2018. (Tr. 60) \nHe receives $600 a month in military retirement, and he has approximately $15,000 in \nsavings. He told the clearance investigator that he and his wife have residual or \ndiscretionary income of approximately $ 3,000 each month. (GE 8) Applicant completed \nhis SCA in Korea in July 2014. He did not list his delinquent debts because he was not \naware of them, and he admits making financial mistakes and not checking his credit \nreports. (Tr. 70) He testified credibly that he was honestly unaware of these \ndelinquencies and he did not deliberately intend to deceive the government or falsify the \nSCA.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    Policies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d  \n\n \n5 \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.  \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern relating to financial considerations is set out in AG \u00b618:  \n \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance abuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds.  \n \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an individual might knowingly \ncompromise classified information in order to raise money. It encompasses concerns \nabout an individual\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting \nclassified information. An individual who is financially irresponsible may also be \nirresponsible, unconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified \ninformation. \n \nAG \u00b6 19 provides conditions that could raise security concerns. The following \napply here:  \n\n \n6 \n \n \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n \n           (c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s delinquent debts alleged in the SOR are confirmed by his credit \nreports and answer to the SOR. The Government produced substantial evidence to \nsupport the disqualifying conditions in AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and 19(c), thereby shifting the \nburden to Applicant to produce evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts.4 Applicant has met that burden. The second mortgage and other delinquent debts \nalleged in the SOR have been adequately addressed.  \n \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns \narising from financial difficulties. The following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are \npotentially applicable: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment;  \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control . . . , and the individual acted responsibly \nunder the circumstances;     \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and  \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \n \n \nApplicant endured a heart attack, a divorce, and extensive overseas travel for \nwork. Arguably, these conditions were beyond his control. Once he realized that the \ndelinquencies might affect his eligibility for a security clearance, he effectively disputed \nsome debts, and paid others. He acted responsibly under the circumstances and he \nproduced relevant or responsive documentation either in response to the SOR or in \npost-hearing documents. Applicant has the burden to provide sufficient evidence to \nshow that his financial problems are under control, and that his debts were incurred \nunder circumstances making them unlikely to recur. He met that burden. AG \u00b6\u00b6 \n20(a),(b),(d) and (e) apply.  \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \n \n                                                          \n4 Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep 22, 2005) (An applicant has the \nburden of proving a mitigating condition, and the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government). \n\n \n7 \n \n  \nThe security concern for personal conduct is set out in AG \u00b6 15, as follows: \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes\u2026.  \n \n  \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. The following disqualifying conditions are potentially applicable: \n \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement or similar \nform used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, \naward benefits or status, determine security clearance eligibility or \ntrustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities. \n \n        Applicant testified credibly that he was in Korea when he completed his SCA in \n2014 and he honestly was not aware of the delinquent debts alleged in the SOR. Since \nthe evidence shows that his largest debt, the second mortgage, does not exist, and \nmany other debts were successfully disputed or paid off, I find his testimony to be \ncompelling and I accept his explanation. It has not been established that he deliberately \nor intentionally falsified his SCA or tried to deceive the government. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s \neligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct \nand all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments \n\n \n8 \n \nunder Guidelines F and E in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 \n2(d) were addressed under that guidelines.  \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with no questions or doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude Applicant has \nmitigated the financial considerations security concerns and that personal conduct \nconcerns were not established.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.l:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:                       FOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.a:                                   For Applicant \n \n \n \n \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is  \nclearly consistent with the national interest to continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \n \n \n \n \n      ________________________ \n \n \n \n \n     Robert J.

He has been employed as a mechanic for another company since 2015, and has a history of civilian jobs overseas for U.S. defense contractors in Iraq, Afghanistan, Kuwait, Syria, and Germany. Applicant was born in South Korea and adopted by U.S. citizens in 1980 when he was a child. He naturalized as a U.S. citizen in 4 1984. He did not graduate from high school, but received a general education diploma (GED) in 1997. He married a U.S. military member in 2000 and worked as a contractor in Germany during his spouse\u2019s assignment there. They divorced in 2009, and he has two children from that marriage. Applicant remarried in October 2010, to a Chinese citizen while he was living in China. They returned to the United States in February 2014, when his spouse became a permanent resident of the United States. His spouse naturalized as a U.S. citizen in March 2018. They have three children, all U.S. citizens. Applicant has never served in the military, but he reported that as a civilian contractor, he held a DOD security clearance in or about June 2009, and an interim clearance in 2015 that has been withdrawn.

Foreign \ninfluence and personal conduct concerns were not mitigated, but financial considerations \nwere mitigated. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nApplicant submitted security clearance applications (SCAs) on June 16, 2009, and \nOctober 6, 2015. On June 2, 2017, the Department of Defense Consolidated \nAdjudications Facility (DOD CAF) sent him a Statement of Reasons (SOR) alleging \nsecurity concerns under Guideline B (Foreign Influence), Guideline E (Personal Conduct), \nand Guideline F (Financial Considerations). The DOD CAF acted under Executive Order \n(Exec. Or.) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, \n1960), as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security \nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and adjudicative \nguidelines (AG). \n \n\n \n2 \n \nApplicant answered the SOR on July 17, 2017, and requested a hearing before an \nadministrative judge. The case was assigned to me on December 12, 2018. The SOR \nwas amended on March 29, 2018, to change two dates and references from Frankfurt, \nGermany to Mannheim, Germany in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.g and 2.l. The amended SOR was properly \nserved on Applicant, who admitted the revised allegations on January 27, 2019. \n \nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued hearing notices with \nother administrative judges on April 20, 2018, and June 15, 2018, that were canceled in \ncoordination with Applicant\u2019s counsel. A hearing notice was issued by me on December \n12, 2018, and the hearing was convened on January 23, 2019. Government Exhibits (GE) \n1 through 10 (and a list of Government exhibits marked as Hearing Exhibit (HE) 1) were \nmarked and GE 1-10 were admitted in evidence. Applicant Exhibits (AE) A and B were \nmarked and admitted in evidence. Applicant and his current spouse testified. DOHA \nreceived the hearing transcript (Tr.) on January 31, 2019. \n \nAlthough Applicant declined to adopt the summary of his interview with a \ngovernment investigator, he made substantial corrections and clarifications to the \nsummary in his response to interrogatories. Most of his corrections involved explanations \nor updates on his interview with the investigator, but some involved correcting or changing \nthe investigator\u2019s summary. The response to interrogatories and the summary statement \nwere admitted in the record without objection (Tr. 16-19). I have noted Applicant\u2019s \ncomments and corrections to the summary interview, and will give appropriate weight to \nthe interview summary based on Applicant\u2019s written corrections, explanations, and \ntestimony. \n \nRequest for Administrative Notice \n \nI took administrative notice of facts concerning the People\u2019s Republic of China. \nDepartment Counsel provided supporting documents that verify, detail, and provide \ncontext for the requested facts. The Government\u2019s request and the supporting \nbackground documents are marked as HE 2. Administrative or official notice is the \nappropriate type of notice used for administrative proceedings. (ISCR Case No. 05-11292 \nat 4 n.1 (App. Bd. Apr. 12, 2007); McLeod v. Immigration and Naturalization Service, 802 \nF.2d 89, 93 n.4 (3d Cir. 1986)) Usually administrative notice in ISCR proceedings is \naccorded to facts that are either well known or derived from government reports. (Stein, \nAdministrative Law, Section 25.01 (Bender & Co. 2006)) A summary of the general \nfacts noticed are included below. \n \nThe People\u2019s Republic of China is the most aggressive collector of U.S. economic, \nintelligence, and defense information and technology. China\u2019s intelligence services, \nprivate companies, and other entities frequently seek to exploit Chinese citizens or \npersons with family ties to China who can use their insider access to corporate or \ngovernmental networks, to illegally obtain sensitive or classified information.  \n \nThe United States faces a large and growing threat to its national security from \nChinese intelligence collection operations. These operations have risen significantly over \n\n \n3 \n \nthe past 15 years. Among the most serious threats are China\u2019s efforts at cyber and human \ninfiltration of U.S. national security organizations. China uses a variety of methods to \nacquire foreign military and dual-use technologies, including cyber activity and \nexploitation of access of Chinese nationals - such as students or researchers \u2013 acting as \nprocurement agents or intermediaries. The threat from Chinese intelligence operations \nalso extends overseas, including a growing technical collection capability to monitor \ndeployed U.S. military forces, and attempts to infiltrate defense entities in the U.S. and \npartner countries.  \n \nThe Chinese government has conducted large-scale, professional, cyber \nespionage against the United States and compromised a range of U.S. networks. \nAdditionally, China\u2019s communist government is an authoritarian state that represses and \ncoerces organizations and individuals involved in civil and political rights advocacy, ethnic \nminorities, and law firms representing individuals involved in sensitive cases. China also \nhas a well-known history of significant civil rights abuses against ethnic and religious \nminorities. The government is responsible for arbitrary or unlawful deprivation of life, \nforced disappearances, torture and coerced confessions of prisoners, arbitrary and illegal \ndetention at unofficial holding facilities. \n \n \nThe U.S. Department of State has warned that U.S. citizens visiting or resident in \nChina have been interrogated or detained for reasons said to be related to \u201cstate security,\u201d \nand U.S. citizens may be detained without access to U.S. consular services or information \nabout their alleged crime. Also, U.S. citizens may be subject to \u201cexit bans\u201d used coercively \nby Chinese authorities to keep U.S. citizens in China for years. The government regularly \nviolates the individual and human rights of its citizens, and surveils and monitors foreign \nvisitors to China. Hotel rooms, meeting rooms, offices, cars, taxis, telephones, internet \nusage and fax machines may be monitored onsite or remotely, and personal possessions \nin hotel rooms, including computers, may be searched without knowledge or consent of \nthe owner.  \n \nChina does not recognize dual nationality. U.S.-Chinese citizens and U.S. citizens \nof Chinese heritage may be subject to additional scrutiny and harassment, and China \nmay prevent the U.S. Embassy from providing consular services. Regardless of the travel \ndocuments used, dual nationals or those with an ethnic or historical tie to China may be \nconsidered by Chinese authorities to be Chinese citizens and can be denied access to \nU.S. consular representatives if detained. Chinese authorities generally consider a child \nborn in China to at least one Chinese parent, to be a Chinese citizen, even if the child \nwas issued a U.S. passport at the time of birth.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant is a 44-year-old mechanic with a pending employment offer with a \ndefense contractor. He has been employed as a mechanic for another company since \n2015, and has a history of civilian jobs overseas for U.S. defense contractors in Iraq, \nAfghanistan, Kuwait, Syria, and Germany. Applicant was born in South Korea and \nadopted by U.S. citizens in 1980 when he was a child. He naturalized as a U.S. citizen in \n\n \n4 \n \n1984. He did not graduate from high school, but received a general education diploma \n(GED) in 1997. He married a U.S. military member in 2000 and worked as a contractor in \nGermany during his spouse\u2019s assignment there. They divorced in 2009, and he has two \nchildren from that marriage.  \n \nApplicant remarried in October 2010, to a Chinese citizen while he was living in \nChina. They returned to the United States in February 2014, when his spouse became a \npermanent resident of the United States. His spouse naturalized as a U.S. citizen in March \n2018. They have three children, all U.S. citizens. Applicant has never served in the \nmilitary, but he reported that as a civilian contractor, he held a DOD security clearance in \nor about June 2009, and an interim clearance in 2015 that has been withdrawn. \n \nThe SOR alleges under Guideline B that Applicant\u2019s spouse is a citizen of China, \nand his mother-in-law is a citizen and resident of China. (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-b)  \n \nUnder Guideline E, the SOR alleges Applicant failed to disclose on a 2015 SCA, \nthree jobs held from 2014 to 2015, and being fired from a job in August 2015. (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 \n2.a-d) Additionally, the SOR alleges Applicant failed to disclose on the 2015 SCA that he \nwas charged with possession and distribution of marijuana at a U.S. military base in 2002 \n(SOR \u00b6 2.e); charged with driving while intoxicated (DWI) in 2004 and 2007 while living \nin Germany (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.f-g); failing to report being delinquent in child-support obligations \n(SOR \u00b6 2.h), cross-alleged in SOR \u00b6 3.c; and failing to report delinquent debts (SOR \u00b6 \n2.i), cross-alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 3.a-c, including child-support obligations. \n \nThe SOR also alleges under Guideline E that Applicant failed to disclose on his \n2009 SCA the 2002 charge of distribution and possession of marijuana at a U.S. military \ninstallation, and the 2004 and 2007 alcohol-related charges while in Germany (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 \n2.j-l); and failing to disclose intervention by law enforcement because of his use of alcohol, \nand a referral to alcohol counseling or treatment from the 2004 DWI incident (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 \n2.m). \n \nFinally, the SOR alleges under Guideline F a delinquent medical collection account \nfor $1,400; a charged-off credit account for $4,884; and a delinquent child-support \naccount for approximately $19,278 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 3.a-c).  \n \nGenerally, Applicant admitted the SOR allegations, but provided explanations and \nclarifications with his Answers. He generally responded that his failure to report incidents \nin his SCAs resulted from his lack of formal education and he is not computer savvy. He \nclaimed that he did not pay attention to the questions and received inadequate assistance \nwhen completing the SCAs. Additionally, Applicant admitted the allegations listed as \namended SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.g and 2.l. in his answer to the amended SOR. \n \nApplicant was arrested three times, two involving alcohol and one involving drugs. \nIn his 2009 and 2015 SCAs, he reported that he has never been charged with an offense \ninvolving alcohol or drugs. Applicant discussed these incidents in his interview with a \ngovernment investigator. He provided corrections, updates, or explanations to areas of \n\n \n5 \n \nthe interview summary that he believed needed clarification. These incidents are \ndiscussed in further detail below. \n \nIn 2002, Applicant was arrested at a U.S. military installation for possession and \ndistribution of marijuana. In testimony, he claimed he used marijuana once per day for \ntwo weeks to reduce pain from a 2001 hernia surgery. He smoked it in the on-post \nquarters or on his back porch where he and his spouse lived, and he stored it in his kitchen \nout of view of his spouse. He claimed that she never cooked, so she did not discover it in \nthe kitchen. The military police were dispatched to Applicant\u2019s home because of a noise \ncomplaint. Applicant claimed alternatively that he was using it on his back porch and on \nhis couch. During the interaction with military police, Applicant admitted possession of \nmarijuana. He was apprehended and questioned, and he provided a sworn statement. \nLaw enforcement records show that Applicant was found in possession of 130.6 grams \nof marijuana. The police investigation concluded there was probable cause to believe that \nApplicant distributed marijuana by giving a bag containing approximately 4.3 grams to \nanother person, based on admissions by the other person. Applicant provided a sworn \nstatement admitting to possessing and distributing marijuana. The report notes the case \nwas referred to the area Special Assistant U.S. Attorney (SAUSA), who believed that \nthere was sufficient evidence to prosecute Applicant. The record is devoid of additional \ninformation with regard to resulting actions by the SAUSA or installation authorities.   \n \nIn an interview with a government investigator, Applicant acknowledged that he \nwas charged with illegal drug usage. He noted in his interview that military police were \ncalled to his home because of a noise complaint by neighbors, and that they wrote an \nincident report and departed the home. In testimony, he stated that the police were called \nbecause Applicant\u2019s neighbor reported marijuana use. He also first claimed that he was \n\u201cnot arrested, just questioned at another location.\u201d He later admitted that he was arrested \nand transported to the military police station where he provided a statement. (Tr. at 45, \n87) \n \nApplicant stated the charge was dropped because he did not have to appear \nbefore any authority. When asked in his 2009 and 2015 SCAs whether he was \u201cEVER \ncharged with an offense involving drugs,\u201d he replied \u201cno.\u201d He followed this answer with a \nseries of inconsistent and contradictory statements. In his clearance interview, he claimed \nhe did not report it on his 2009 and 2015 SCAs because he forgot about it after the charge \nwas dropped, that it occurred more than 10 years ago, and he simply did not care (GE \n10). He stated in response to interrogatories, that the SCA required him to report only \ndrug usage in the past seven years, and that he did care.  \n \nApplicant was arrested in Germany for driving while intoxicated (DWI) in 2004 after \nhe was stopped by German police and failed a breathalyzer test. He was turned over to \nthe U.S. military police, and released to his spouse and her military command. In 2007, \nApplicant was again arrested in Germany for driving with a blood alcohol content of .067 \nafter drinking at a club and driving. His car was impounded, and he was released to his \nspouse and her military command. He stated to the investigator that he was required to \nattend the Army Substance Abuse Program (ASAP) as a result of one of his arrests, and \n\n \n6 \n \nhe said he attended more than one session. However, in contradictory testimony, \nApplicant denied ever attending ASAP or any substance abuse evaluation or counseling.  \n \nIn response to questions on his 2009 and 2015 SCAs whether he has \u201cEVER been \ncharged with an offense involving alcohol or drugs,\u201d he responded \u201cno.\u201d He followed this \nwith inconsistent and contradictory statements. In his interview with a government \ninvestigator, he initially denied that he had any prior alcohol-related arrests. When \nreminded by the investigator of the need for candor, he admitted the two incidents in \nGermany. In response to questions on why he had not listed them on his SCAs, he stated \nhe did not read the SCA instructions well, but he was adamant that he only needed to \nreport alcohol-related incidents that occurred within seven years. In his response to \ninterrogatories, he acknowledged that he should have read the SCA instructions better, \nbut thought the question pertained to a seven-year period. He also said the incident \noccurred a long time ago and when he was younger and did not think things through. \nHowever, in testimony, he claimed that he did not report the first alcohol-related arrest \nbecause he did not think it was an arrest since he did not go to jail, and he failed to report \nthe second arrest because he forgot.  \n \nApplicant worked for a government contractor in Iraq for about eight months in \n2008 before resigning, and in Afghanistan from approximately January 2009 until August \n2009. He stated that he met a Chinese national online in August 2009. He vacationed in \nChina for two weeks in August, and met with her. He returned to China in September \n2010, and stayed until February 2014. While in China, Applicant married in October 2010, \ntraveled extensively around China, and their first child was born in China. Applicant also \nheld two jobs in China teaching English to Chinese students from wealthy families, from \n2010 to 2014. He returned to the United States in 2014 with his Chinese-speaking spouse, \nand his first-born child. His spouse did not speak English, except for what he taught her. \n \nApplicant completed an SCA on October 6, 2015. In it, he reported that his mother-\nin-law is a Chinese citizen, living in China, and he and his spouse had daily contact with \nher via the Internet. He reported that his mother-in-law was retired, and her husband was \ndeceased. In testimony, Applicant noted that his mother-in-law never worked in China, \nand now lives with him as a U.S. permanent resident. She owns an apartment in China \nthat she is trying to sell. In Applicant\u2019s interview with a government investigator in \nNovember 2015, he stated that he believed his mother-in-law previously worked as a bus \ndriver. Applicant noted that he does not speak Chinese and his mother-in-law does not \nspeak English, so he has had no verbal or written contact with her even when he lived in \nChina (GE 10).  \n \nIn his 2015 SCA, Applicant reported that he and his spouse had no foreign contacts \nin the previous seven years. However, he testified that his spouse has grandparents, \naunts, uncles, and cousins in China to whom his spouse communicates with about every \ntwo weeks through a phone application. Applicant\u2019s spouse sends items to China that a \ncousin purchases about twice per year. \n \n\n \n7 \n \nApplicant\u2019s spouse testified, and stated that she returned to China in July 2014 \nand stayed for three months while her mother helped her with her pregnancy. Her mother \ncame to the United States in 2015 and stayed for six months. Her mother then took their \nsecond child back to China for one year when the girl was a year old. At another time, \nshe took another child, at two years old, to China and stayed for 11 months. Her mother \nreturned to the United States in 2016 and applied for permanent resident status in 2018. \nShe stated that her mother retired from selling bus tickets in China, and her father was a \npolice officer who died of cancer at 53 years old. Applicant\u2019s spouse went to university in \nCyprus from 2004 to 2006 for a degree in tourism before returning home to China. After \nmarrying and coming to the United States with Applicant, she naturalized as a U.S. citizen \nin March 2018. She stated that her Chinese passport was cancelled. She attributed her \nexcellent command of the English language to her spouse, who was her primary source \nof instruction. \n \nApplicant failed to report three jobs on his 2015 SCA, including a position teaching \nEnglish to Chinese high-school students in the United States, a position at a car \ndealership, and a position as a crane inspector. In addition, he failed to report that he was \nfired from the crane operator job. These jobs are described below. \n \nFrom August 2014 to June 2015, after returning to the United States from China, \nApplicant taught English to Chinese high-school students residing in the United States. \nHe tutored, supervised, and transported the Chinese students to and from school, and \nlived with them in a home provided by a company that provides these services to Chinese \nnationals in the U.S. He described the job as mostly \u201cbabysitting\u201d and that he did not like \nit. Applicant did not list this employment on his 2015 SCA. In a summary of Applicant\u2019s \ninterview, he stated that he intentionally did not list the job because it had nothing to do \nwith military contracts and he \u201cjust did not want to list it\u201d (GE 10). In his response to \ninterrogatories, he stated that he did not list the job because it was not relevant since it \nhad nothing to do with military contracts and that he was paid as an independent \ncontractor. Applicant\u2019s former employer reported that Applicant left the job voluntarily but \nthe employment was not entirely favorable. His supervisor noted that Applicant was \u201cnot \nwell educated\u201d to be an English teacher, but he worked hard and was responsible (GE \n5). \n \nTwo other jobs were also not disclosed on his SCA, including a three-month \nposition at a car dealership, and a three-month position as a crane inspector. He was \nfired from this job due to a safety violation (GE 6). In a summary of Applicant\u2019s government \ninterview, he stated that he did not disclose the crane inspector job and subsequent firing \nbecause he \u201choped [he] would get away with it\u201d and not get caught. In his response to \ninterrogatories, he claimed that he was upset and embarrassed about the situation \nbecause it was really an episode of racial discrimination against him, rather than a safety \nviolation, and that listing temporary positions, less than six months, were not relevant \nbecause they had nothing to do with military contracts (GE 10). In testimony, he claimed \nhe did not report the missing jobs because he was not at them long enough to list them, \nand he did not list being fired from the crane inspector job because of false statements \nabout him. He described the jobs as \u201cstepping-stone\u201d jobs that he believed did not have \n\n \n8 \n \nto be listed on his SCA when held for less than six months. Of note, in contrast to his \ntestimony and interrogatory response, he did list a five-month teacher job in China and a \nfive-month mechanics job on his 2015 SCA (GE 1). \n \nApplicant was delinquent on three debts, including child-support obligations that \nhe did not report on his 2015 SCA. A medical debt for $1,400 was incurred in 2014 and \nhe testified was paid in 2015 (SOR \u00b6 3.a). Rather, documentation submitted with his \nAnswer to the SOR show that it was paid in 2017.  \n \nA credit card debt was charged off for $4,884 (SOR \u00b6 3.b) after Applicant \u201cforgot \nto pay.\u201d He first claimed it was paid off in 2015, but later testified that it was not paid until \n2016. Rather, documentation submitted with his Answer to the SOR show that it was paid \nin 2017. \n \nA debt on a child-support account for $19,278 was past due (SOR \u00b6 3.c). Applicant \nstopped paying his child support in 2011 while living in China, and stated to a government \ninvestigator that he did not pay the court-ordered support because he was angry at his \nformer spouse. He first testified that he caught up on the arrearage in 2015, but later \nadmitted that his pay was garnished in 2014 or 2015, but his employers did not act on the \ngarnishment order until 2017. As of September 2015, Applicant owed $19,112, and as of \nSeptember 2016, he owed $3,402. Per his Answer to the SOR, his arrearage was paid \noff by 2017. Applicant did not report his garnishment and the child-support debt on his \n2015 SCA (SOR \u00b6 2.h). In addition, he also failed to report the other listed delinquent \ndebts (SOR \u00b6 2.i). He testified that he failed to report the arrearage because he did not \nthink about it. \n \n \nApplicant submitted several letters of support, family photos, and certificates of \ntraining and performance. His co-workers, supervisors, and friends acknowledge his \nperformance, loyalty, and excellent work ethic. I found Applicant to be less than \nforthcoming in testimony, and he often gave conflicting accounts.  \n \nLaw and Policies \n \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 2. \n \nNational security eligibility is predicated upon the applicant meeting the criteria \ncontained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. \nInstead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge applies \nthese guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative \njudge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \n\n \n9 \n \nadministrative judge must consider a person\u2019s stability, trustworthiness, reliability, \ndiscretion, character, honesty, and judgment. AG \u00b6 1(b). \n \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865  \n\u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \n \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \u201cSubstantial \nevidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. Washington \nMetro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines presume a \nnexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria listed \ntherein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 12-01295 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Jan. 20, 2015). \n \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, \nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. \n02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \n \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01- \n20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see, AG \u00b6 1(d). \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline E: Personal Conduct \nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the personal conduct security concern: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \n\n \n10 \n \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. \n \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying in this case, and I considered all of them. The following disqualifying \ncondition are potentially applicable: \n \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar \nform used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, \naward benefits or status, determine national security eligibility or \ntrustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities. \n \nThe findings of fact enumerate numerous incidents of falsification and failure to \ndisclose required information, which raise serious questions of Applicant\u2019s judgment, \nhonesty, and reliability. His failure to truthfully, fully, and consistently report his \nbackground and activities to the Government as required, raise unresolved questions \nabout his conduct. \n \nApplicant also failed to disclose two other positions on his SCA, including one \ninvolving an involuntary termination; two alcohol-related criminal incidents in a foreign \ncountry and a referral to alcohol counseling; a drug-related incident involving possession \nand distribution of marijuana on a U.S. military installation; and financial delinquencies \nincluding a substantial child-support arrearage and garnishment order. \n \nThese omissions display a history of poor decisions, qualities of untrustworthiness, \nand a lack of candor that implicates disqualifying condition AG \u00b6 16 (a). \n \nGuideline E includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising from \npersonal conduct. I considered all of the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 17 and found \nnone to be fully applicable. \n \n  \nApplicant omitted substantial information from his 2009 and 2015 SCAs. His \nstatements to a government investigator left several areas which required Applicant to \ncorrect or explain in order to mitigate the concerns they raised. I find Applicant\u2019s claims \nof mistake, forgetfulness, or unintentional omissions to be untruthful in themselves. \nApplicant intentionally omitted personally damaging information from his SCAs, and left it \nto the government to discover his past behavior without benefit of his voluntary \ndisclosures. His reaction to the Government investigator\u2019s inquiries resulted in attempts \nto minimize the omissions or conduct. His hearing testimony compounded inconsistencies \nfrom earlier testimony, past responses to interrogatories, the interview summary, and \nSCA answers. \n \n \n \n\n \n11 \n \n \nAdditionally, based on his demonstrated lack of candor, I am not convinced that \nApplicant\u2019s background has been fully disclosed or adequately explained, to include the \ndepth and circumstances of his association with China and its citizens. These remaining \nquestions, individually and taken together with Applicant\u2019s failure to voluntarily disclose \nrelevant and significant information to the Government, are additional reasons to cause \nme to question his overall truthfulness and trustworthiness with national security \ninformation. \n \nGuideline B: Foreign Influence \n \n \nThe security concern for foreign influence is set out in AG \u00b6 6: \n \nForeign contacts and interests may be a security concern if the individual \nhas divided loyalties or foreign financial interests, may be manipulated or \ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a \nway that is not in U.S. interests, or is vulnerable to pressure or coercion by \nany foreign interest. Adjudication under this Guideline can and should \nconsider the identity of the foreign country in which the foreign contact or \nfinancial interest is located, including, but not limited to, such considerations \nas whether the foreign country is known to target United States citizens to \nobtain protected information and/or is associated with a risk of terrorism. \n \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 7, and I considered all of them. The following are potentially applicable in this case:  \n  \n(a) contact, regardless of method, with a foreign family member, business \nor professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or \nresident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of \nforeign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; \n \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual\u2019s obligation to \nprotect sensitive information or technology and the individual\u2019s desire to \nhelp a foreign person, group, or country by providing that information; and \n \n(e) shared living quarters with a person or persons, regardless of citizenship \nstatus, if that relationship creates a heightened risk of foreign inducement, \nmanipulation, pressure, or coercion. \n \nApplicant\u2019s spouse is now a U.S. citizen. However, they both retain a close \nrelationship with his mother-in-law, a Chinese citizen living with them. China is an \naggressive collector of intelligence and defense information and a country known to \nexploit U.S. citizens of Chinese dissent, Chinese citizens living abroad, and U.S. citizens \nwith connections to China. Applicant\u2019s associations with China, including through his \nspouse and mother-in-law, create a heightened risk of foreign exploitation, inducement, \nmanipulation, pressure, or coercion. \n\n \n12 \n \nThe conditions and concerns raised above and detailed in the findings of fact, \ncreate a heightened risk of foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or \ncoercion, and a potential conflict of interest. AG \u00b6\u00b6 7(a), (b), and (e) apply. \n \n \nConditions that could mitigate foreign influence security concerns are provided \nunder AG \u00b6 8, and I have considered all of them. The following are potentially applicable:  \n \n(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in which \nthese persons are located, or the positions or activities of those persons in \nthat country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be placed in a \nposition of having to choose between the interests of a foreign individual, \ngroup, organization, or government and the interests of the U.S.; and \n \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of \nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, group, government, or country is \nso minimal, or the individual has such deep and longstanding relationships \nand loyalties in the U.S., that the individual can be expected to resolve any \nconflict of interest in favor of the U.S. interest. \n \nNo mitigation condition fully applies. Applicant\u2019s past and current close contact with \nChina and Chinese citizens is substantial and continuing. His foreign relationships, \nincluding those through his spouse and mother-in-law, are significant. Additionally, he has \nturned at least two of his children over to his mother-in-law to return to China to live \nwithout him or his spouse, for extended periods of time. Applicant lives and works \nprimarily in overseas conflict areas. He also lived and worked in China for four-and-a-half \nyears. Applicant\u2019s family now lives in the United States, along with his mother-in-law who \nremains a Chinese citizen but who lives with him. Applicant\u2019s ties to China continue to \ncreate an unacceptable risk to national security. \n \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \n \n \nThe security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18:       \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds . . . .  \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case:   \n\n \n13 \n \n(a) inability to satisfy debts;  \n \n(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so; and \n \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \n \n \nApplicant incurred over $25,000 in delinquent debts, including child-support \narrearages because he did not pay while in China and, alternatively because of a conflict \nwith his ex-spouse. The record evidence is sufficient to raise the above disqualifying \nconditions. \n \n  \nConditions that could mitigate the financial considerations security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 20, and I considered all of them. The following are potentially \napplicable:  \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; and \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \n \n \nApplicant failed to disclose his delinquent debts on his 2015 SCA, and \nirresponsibly allowed the debts to accrue, especially his past-due child-support \nobligations. He resolved the medical and credit card debts later than he first reported, and \nwas able to make headway toward his child-support arrearage through an involuntary \ngarnishment of his pay. The debts have been resolved or are being satisfactorily resolved, \ntherefore AG \u00b6 20(d) applies. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n\n \n14 \n \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \n     \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuidelines E, B, and F in this whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(a) \nwere addressed under those guidelines, but some warrant additional comment.  \n \nI considered Applicant\u2019s work for U.S. contractors overseas in conflict areas, and \nhis letters of support, along with his awards, training, and certificates. I acknowledge that \nmarrying a foreign national is not, in and of itself, a disqualifying event. I also recognize \nhis spouse\u2019s efforts to become a U.S. citizen, and her desire to give her children a good \neducation and quality life in the United States.  \n \nI am concerned with Applicant\u2019s and his spouse\u2019s previously undisclosed \ncommunications and associations with Chinese relatives living in China. In addition, his \nmother-in-law, who is a Chinese citizen and owns property in China, often travels between \nthe United States and China, including taking Applicant\u2019s children unaccompanied by their \nparents, back to China for extended periods of time. China does not recognize dual \nnationality and dual nationals or those with an ethnic or historical tie to China may be \nconsidered by Chinese authorities to be Chinese citizens. As Applicant\u2019s first child was \nborn in China, it should be noted that China generally considers a child born in China to \nat least one Chinese parent to be a Chinese citizen, even if the child is also a U.S. citizen. \nApplicant\u2019s spouse is a recent U.S. citizen, has returned to China after residing in the \nUnited States, and she and her children maintain a continuing association with family in \nChina. \n \nApplicant\u2019s four-and-a-half years in China, ties to Chinese citizens, and work \nhistory in China and for Chinese high school students in the United States, is concerning.  \nTaken together with his failure to disclose relevant information in his SCAs, conduct while \nliving overseas and on a U.S. military post, irresponsible financial decisions, and \ninconsistent statements continue to raise questions about his overall honesty, reliability, \nand judgment.  \n\n \n15 \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with significant questions and doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance based on foreign influence \nand personal conduct security concerns. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \n \nPARAGRAPH 1, GUIDELINE B:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a - 1.b:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nPARAGRAPH 2, GUIDELINE E:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \nSubparagraphs 2.a \u2013 2.m:   \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \nPARAGRAPH 3, GUIDELINE F:  \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \nSubparagraphs 3.a \u2013 3.c:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n \n_______________________ \nGregg A. Cervi \nAdministrative Judge \n",

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant is a 35-year-old military-vehicle mechanic for a government contractor since 2014. In 2013, Applicant was terminated from a previous job as a result of a 2013 driving while intoxicated (DWI) conviction. He graduated from high school in 2001. He was married in 2010 and divorced in 2013. He has three children, two of whom currently live with him. He lives with his girlfriend and cares for her three children as well. He currently holds CAC eligibility for access to a government facility. The SOR alleges a 2001 arrest and conviction for DWI; a 2002 arrest for possession of a controlled substance that was not prosecuted; a 2010 arrest and conviction for drunk in public; a 2011 arrest for assault by physical contact; a 2013 DWI arrest and conviction; and a 2013 citation for driving on an invalid license. The alcohol-related allegations were cross-alleged under the standard for alcohol abuse, and Applicant\u2019s job loss due to his 2013 DWI was alleged under the standard for misconduct or negligence in employment. Applicant admitted all of the allegations except he noted that his 2002 possession charge was \u201cno billed\u201d by the grand jury. Applicant was arrested in 2001 for DWI when he was 18 years old.

Olmos, Esq., Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro se \n \n \n \n______________ \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \n \nCERVI, Gregg A., Administrative Judge: \n \nApplicant mitigated the Common Access Card (CAC) credentialing concerns raised \nunder supplemental adjudicative standards (SAS) for criminal or dishonest conduct and \nalcohol abuse. The concern for misconduct or negligence in employment was unfounded. \nCAC eligibility is granted.  \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nOn May 31, 2017, the Department of Defense (DOD) issued a Statement of Reasons \n(SOR) to Applicant detailing credentialing concerns for CAC eligibility under Homeland \nSecurity Presidential Directive \u2013 12 (HSPD-12). The DOD was unable to find that granting \nApplicant CAC eligibility did not pose an unacceptable risk.1 The concerns raised under the \nAdjudicative Standards of DODI 5200.46 are SAS \u00b6 2.a, criminal or dishonest conduct; \u00b6 \n4.a, alcohol abuse; and \u00b6 1.a, misconduct or negligence in employment. \n \n                                                          \n1 The action was taken under the Adjudicative Standards found in DOD Instruction (DODI) 5200.46, DOD \nInvestigative and Adjudicative Guidelines for Issuing the CAC, dated September 9, 2014, and the \nprocedures set out in Enclosure 3 of DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security \nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive). \n \n  12/11/2018\n\n2 \n \nApplicant responded to the SOR on June 23, 2017, and requested a hearing before \nan administrative judge. The case was assigned to me on November 20, 2017. The Defense \nOffice of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a notice of hearing on February 22, 2018, \nscheduling the hearing for March 14, 2018. The hearing was convened as scheduled. \nGovernment Exhibits (GE) 1 through 6 were admitted in evidence without objection. \nApplicant testified and after the hearing, submitted documents marked as Applicant Exhibits \n(AE) A-D, which were admitted without objection. DOHA received the hearing transcript (Tr.) \non March 22, 2018.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant is a 35-year-old military-vehicle mechanic for a government contractor \nsince 2014. In 2013, Applicant was terminated from a previous job as a result of a 2013 \ndriving while intoxicated (DWI) conviction. He graduated from high school in 2001. He was \nmarried in 2010 and divorced in 2013. He has three children, two of whom currently live with \nhim. He lives with his girlfriend and cares for her three children as well. He currently holds \nCAC eligibility for access to a government facility. \n \n \nThe SOR alleges a 2001 arrest and conviction for DWI; a 2002 arrest for possession \nof a controlled substance that was not prosecuted; a 2010 arrest and conviction for drunk \nin public; a 2011 arrest for assault by physical contact; a 2013 DWI arrest and conviction; \nand a 2013 citation for driving on an invalid license. The alcohol-related allegations were \ncross-alleged under the standard for alcohol abuse, and Applicant\u2019s job loss due to his 2013 \nDWI was alleged under the standard for misconduct or negligence in employment. Applicant \nadmitted all of the allegations except he noted that his 2002 possession charge was \u201cno \nbilled\u201d by the grand jury. \n \n \nApplicant was arrested in 2001 for DWI when he was 18 years old. He attended \nAlcoholics Anonymous meetings and a Mothers Against Drunk Driving course mandated by \nhis terms of probation. In 2002, he was arrested for possession of cocaine, but the case \nwas \u201cno billed\u201d and he was not prosecuted. He admitted first using marijuana while in \nseventh grade, and he stopped in 2010. He also used cocaine once when he was 15 years \nold. \n \n \nIn 2010, Applicant was arrested at a resort for public intoxication after getting into a \ndispute with another person. In 2011, Applicant was arrested for assault after a dispute with \nhis mother\u2019s boyfriend. \n \n \nIn 2013, Applicant was arrested on New Year\u2019s Day for his second DWI. Applicant \nwas convicted and served 15 days in jail. As a result of his conviction, he was terminated \nfrom a job he held since graduating from high school because he was required to install an \nalcohol-interlock device on his work vehicle. His wife divorced him and he lost the home he \nwas renting because of his unemployment. While moving from his home, he was cited for \ndriving on a suspended driver\u2019s license. While serving his sentence in jail, Applicant came \nto the realization that his drinking had led to serious consequences during his life. He vowed \nto stop drinking and has remained abstinent since 2013. \n \n \n\n3 \n \n \nApplicant was evaluated for substance abuse counseling on March 23, 2018, using \nthe Substance Abuse Screening Inventory (SASSI-4). Based on his history of alcohol use, \nhe was assessed as having a high probability of a substance-use disorder. However, the \nlicensed evaluator noted that the SASSI does not yield a clinical diagnosis, but rather a \nscreening result that can be used as one piece of information when conducting clinical \ndiagnostic evaluations. Based on the DSM-V Diagnostic Criteria for Substance Use \nDisorders, Applicant does not display any symptoms of having a substance-use disorder. \nThe evaluator recommended that Applicant need not seek counseling unless he is unable \nto maintain abstinence. To date, he remains abstinent. \n \n \nApplicant no longer stays at events where alcohol is present. He expressed shame \nfor his past behavior and acknowledged how it adversely affected him and his family. He \nsubmitted character letters that generally support his abstinence from alcohol, renewed \nlifestyle, honesty, work ethic, responsible behavior at work and home, and sincere remorse \nfor his past behavior. Applicant\u2019s work site manager has known him for several years and \nnoted that he is a reliable employee who does not pose a threat to anyone. \n \nPolicies \n \nEvery CAC eligibility decision must be a fair and impartial overall commonsense \ndecision based on all available evidence, both favorable and unfavorable. The specific \nissues raised are listed in DODI 5200.46, Enclosure 4, Appendix 1, Basic Adjudicative \nStandards, and Appendix 2, Supplemental Adjudicative Standards. The overriding factor for \nall of these conditions is unacceptable risk.  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The applicant has \nthe ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain CAC eligibility.  \n \nFactors to be applied consistently to all information available include: (1) the nature \nand seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct; (3) the \nrecency and frequency of the conduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of \nthe conduct; (5) contributing external conditions; and (6) the absence or presence of efforts \ntowards rehabilitation. (DODI 5200.46, Enclosure 4, \u00b6 1)  \n \nAnalysis \n \nCriminal or Dishonest Conduct \n \n \nDODI 5200.46, Appendix 2 to Enclosure 4, SAS \u00b6 2 provides: \n \nA CAC will not be issued to a person if there is a reasonable basis to believe, \nbased on the individual\u2019s criminal or dishonest conduct, that issuance of a \nCAC poses an unacceptable risk. \n \n\n4 \n \na. An individual\u2019s conduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, \ndishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise \nquestions about his or her reliability or trustworthiness and may put people, \nproperty, or information systems at risk. An individual\u2019s past criminal or \ndishonest conduct may put people, property, or information systems at risk. \n \nSAS \u00b6 2.b lists several conditions that could raise a CAC concern and may be \ndisqualifying. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n \n(2) charges or admission of criminal conduct relating to the safety of people \nand proper protection of property or information systems, regardless of \nwhether the person was formally charged, formally prosecuted, or convicted; \nand \n \n(5) actions involving violence or sexual behavior of a criminal nature that \nposes an unacceptable risk if access is granted to federally-controlled facilities \nand federally-controlled information systems. \n \n \nApplicant has a history of criminal conduct including assault and DWI. SAS \u00b6\u00b6 2.b \n(2) and (5) apply. \n \n \nSAS \u00b6 2.c provides circumstances relevant to the determination of whether there is \na reasonable basis to believe there is an unacceptable risk. Relevant conditions include: \n \n(1) the behavior happened so long ago, was minor in nature, or happened \nunder such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur; \n \n(2) charges were dismissed or evidence was provided that the person did not \ncommit the offense and details and reasons support his or her innocence; and \n \n(4) evidence has been supplied of successful rehabilitation, including but not \nlimited to remorse or restitution, job training or higher education, good \nemployment record, constructive community involvement, or passage of time \nwithout recurrence. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s last criminal offense was in 2013. At that time, he contemplated how \ncontinued abuse of alcohol adversely affected him and his future. He acknowledged his past \nbehavior and took action to avoid future problems. He stopped drinking in 2013. His \ntestimony and those of his character references support his sobriety and changed behavior. \nHe has a good work history, and but for his 2013 DWI, he would likely still be employed with \nthe same employer since graduating from high school. However, as a result of his DWI and \nthe need for an alcohol-interlock device on a company vehicle, he lost his long-held job. In \n2014, he found a new position that he has since held without incident. \n \n \nApplicant was evaluated for a substance-use disorder and advised to continue his \nabstinence and only seek counseling if he had difficulty complying. Applicant has remained \nsober for over five years and has not had a recurrence of criminal or alcohol-related \n\n5 \n \nincidents. I have sufficient evidence to determine that Applicant\u2019s criminal and alcohol-\nrelated misconduct is unlikely to recur and that his alcohol use is now under control. \nApplicant provided sufficient documentary evidence showing that he does not display any \nsymptoms of having a substance-use disorder and that counseling is not recommended \nunless he is unable to maintain abstinence. \n \nAlcohol Abuse \n \nDODI 5200.46, App. 2 to Encl. 4, SAS \u00b6 4 describes the concern: \n \nA CAC will not be issued to a person if there is a reasonable basis to believe, based \non the nature or duration of the individual\u2019s alcohol abuse without evidence of substantial \nrehabilitation, that issuance of a CAC poses an unacceptable risk. \n \nAn individual\u2019s abuse of alcohol may put people, property, or information systems at \nrisk. Alcohol abuse can lead to the exercise of questionable judgment or failure to control \nimpulses, and may put people, property, or information systems at risk, regardless of \nwhether he or she is diagnosed as an abuser of alcohol or alcohol dependent. A person\u2019s \nlong-term abuse of alcohol without evidence of substantial rehabilitation may indicate that \ngranting a CAC poses an unacceptable safety risk in a U.S. Government facility. \n \nDODI 5200.46, App. 2 to Encl. 4, SAS \u00b6 4b, lists conditions that raise a CAC concern \nand may be disqualifying: \n \n(1) A pattern of alcohol-related arrests. \n \nAs described above, Applicant has a history of alcohol-related incidents resulting in \ncriminal conduct. SAS \u00b6 4b(1) applies because Applicant has a pattern of alcohol-related \narrests. \n \nDODI 5200.46, App. 2 to Encl. 4, SAS \u00b6 4c, lists three conditions that could mitigate \nconcerns about \u201cwhether there is a reasonable basis to believe there is an unacceptable \nrisk\u201d: \n \n(1) The individual acknowledges his or her alcoholism or issues of alcohol \nabuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and \nhas established a pattern of abstinence (if alcohol dependent) or \nresponsible use (if an abuser of alcohol);\n \n(2) The individual is participating in counseling or treatment programs, has \nno history of previous treatment or relapse, and is making satisfactory \nprogress; and \n \n(3) The individual has successfully completed inpatient or outpatient \ncounseling or rehabilitation along with any required aftercare. He or she has \ndemonstrated a clear and established pattern of modified consumption or \nabstinence in accordance with treatment recommendations, such as \n\n \n6 \nparticipation in an alcohol treatment program. The individual has received a \nfavorable prognosis by a duly qualified medical professional or a licensed \nclinical social worker who is a staff member of a recognized alcohol \ntreatment program. \n \nApplicant has acknowledged his alcohol problems and testified to self-abstaining \nfrom alcohol use since 2013. His character letters, medical evaluation, and testimony \nsupport his abstinence for over five years, remorse for his past behavior, and a change \nin lifestyle. As stated above, Applicant was evaluated for a substance-use disorder and \nadvised to continue his abstinence from alcohol and to seek counseling only if he had \ndifficulty complying. I find that SAS \u00b6\u00b6 4c(1) and (2) apply, and 4c(3) partially applies. \n \nMisconduct or Negligence in Employment \n \n \nDODI 5200.46, App. 2 to Encl. 4, SAS \u00b6 1 describes concerns that arise from \nmisconduct or negligence in employment. The SOR allegations raise criminal and alcohol \nrelated issues that resulted in termination from employment, but did not arise while at \nwork nor were they directly related to actions during work. Based on the facts of this case, \nI determine that Applicant\u2019s conduct resulted in his termination, but did not directly \nimplicate standards described under SAS \u00b6 1. Therefore, SOR \u00b6 3.a is unfounded.  \n \n \nI have carefully considered all of the facts of this case and applied the adjudicative \nand whole-person standards in DODI 5200.46. Based on the record and Applicant\u2019s \ntestimony, there is sufficient evidence to find that the behavior leading to the denial of \nApplicant\u2019s CAC eligibility has been overcome and that he no longer poses an \nunacceptable risk. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n Paragraph 1, Criminal or Dishonest Conduct:   \n \nFOR APPLICANT  \n \n  Subparagraphs 1.a-1.f: \n \n \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \nParagraph 2, Alcohol Abuse: \n \n \n \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n  Subparagraph 2.a:  \n \n \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \nParagraph 3, Misconduct or Negligence in Employment: \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n  Subparagraph 3.a:  \n \n \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \n \n\n \n7 \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances, granting Applicant CAC eligibility does not pose \nan unacceptable risk. CAC eligibility is granted. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_______________________ \nGregg A. Cervi \nAdministrative Judge \n",

(Answer.) The case was assigned to me on September 14, \n2017. Due to Applicant\u2019s location in The Republic of Korea, he asked that a notice of \nhearing not be issued until April of 2018. As a result, the Defense Office of Hearings \nand Appeals (DOHA) issued a notice of hearing on April 24, 2018, scheduling the \n                                                          \n1 I considered the previous Adjudicative Guidelines, effective September 1, 2006, as well as the new \nAdjudicative Guidelines, effective June 8, 2017. My decision would be the same if the case was \nconsidered under the previous Adjudicative Guidelines, effective September 1, 2006. \n\n \n2 \n \nhearing for May 23, 2018. The hearing was convened as scheduled. The Government \noffered Exhibits (GX) 1 through 6, which were admitted without objection, and Hearing \nExhibit (HX) I for Administrative Notice. Applicant testified on his own behalf and \npresented one document, which I marked Applicant\u2019s Exhibit (AppXs) A. The record \nwas left open for an additional two months until July 23, 2018, for receipt of additional \ndocumentation. Applicant submitted no additional evidence, only a one page closing \nstatement. DOHA received the transcript of the hearing (TR) on June 8, 2016. \n \nProcedural Rulings \n \n \nAt the hearing, the Government requested I take administrative notice of certain \nfacts relating to the Philippines. Department Counsel provided a five-page summary of \nthe facts, supported by Government documents pertaining to the Philippines, identified \nas HE I. The documents provide elaboration and context for the summary. I take \nadministrative notice of the facts included in the U.S. Government reports. They are \nlimited to matters of general knowledge, not subject to reasonable dispute. They are set \nout in the Findings of Fact. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant admitted to all the allegations in SOR, with explanations. After a \nthorough and careful review of the pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, I make the \nfollowing findings of fact.  \n \n \nApplicant is a 40-year-old employee of a defense contractor. (GX 1 at pages 5 \nand 14.) He has been employed with the defense contractor \u201csince November 2016.\u201d  \n(TR at page 13 line 21 to page 16 line 11.) Previously divorced \u201cin 2014,\u201d he is now \nmarried to a Philippine national, and has two children from his previous marriage. (Id.) \n \nGuideline B - Foreign Influence \n \n \n1.a. and 1.d. Applicant\u2019s wife is a citizen of the Philippines, but resides with \nApplicant in Korea. (TR at page 16 line 19 to page 18 line 21, and at page 35 lines \n5~11.) He gives his wife about $250 each month which she deposits in a Philippine \nbank account. (Id.) \n \n \n1.b., and 1.c. Applicant father-in-law \u201cpassed away\u201d in 2017, and his mother-in-\nlaw \u201cis a homemaker.\u201d He currently provides no financial support for his mother-in-law, \nwho plans to join her sister in the United States. (TR at page 19 line 3 to page 20 line \n22, and at page 23 lines 2~13.)  Applicant\u2019s seven brothers-in-law and two sisters-in-law \n\u201clive in the mountains.\u201d (TR at page 19 line 3 to page 20 line 22.) The men work \u201ca little \nconstruction, [and] farm work,\u201d while the women \u201cwash clothes for money.\u201d (TR at page \n34 line 8 to page 35 line 11.) \u201cThey [all] think . . . [Applicant fixes] electronics.\u201d (TR at \npage 22 line 23 to page 23 line 1.) \n \n\n \n3 \n \n \n1.e. Applicant only owns property in the Philippines, worth about $18,000, where \nhe plans to \u201cretire\u201d in about 15~20 years. He does not own any property in the United \nStates. (TR at page 21 line 12 to page 22 line 22.) \n \nGuideline F - Financial Considerations \n \n \nApplicant attributes his current financial difficulties to the hospitalization of his \nformer spouse, his subsequent divorce, a cut in pay, and a personal bout with stomach \ncancer. (TR at page 26 line 11 to page 27 line 15, and at page 38 line 16 to page 40 line \n25.) \n \n \n2.a. Applicant has filed his Federal income tax returns for tax years 2014 and \n2015, as evidenced by documentation included in his Answer to the SOR. (TR at page \n25 line 25 to page 26 line 10, at page 27 line 19 to page 28 line 15, and Answer.) This \nallegation is found for Applicant. \n \n \n2.b.  Applicant owes a past-due debt to the Army and Air Force  Exchange \nService (AFES) in the amount of about $11,000. (TR at page 28 lines 16~21, and at \npage 37 lines 5~20.) Despite having two months after his hearing to do so, Applicant \nhas provided nothing further in this regard. This allegation is found against Applicant. \n \n \n2.c., 2.e., and 2.f.  Applicant owes three past-due debts to a credit union in the \namount of about $21,000. (TR at page 28 line 22 to page 31 line 4, at page 32 line 3 to \npage 35 line 8, and at page 36 line 12 to page 37 line 4.) Despite having two months \nafter his hearing to do so, Applicant has provided nothing further in this regard. These \nallegations are found against Applicant. \n \n \n2.d. Applicant has paid a $532 past-due debt on an automobile loan, as \nevidenced by documentation showing this automobile has been sold. (TR at page 31 \nlines 5~17, and AppX A.) This allegation is found for Applicant.  \n \n \nNotice \n \n \nI take administrative notice of certain facts relating to the Philippines: the United \nStates continues to work with the Philippine government to monitor and investigate \ngroups engaged in or supporting terrorist activities in the Philippines. The Philippine \ngovernment is also currently engaged in a nationwide counter-narcotics campaign. \nExtrajudicial killings have been the chief human rights concern in the Philippines. \n \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \n\n \n4 \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious \nscrutiny of a number of variables known as the whole-person concept. The \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record.  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d  \n \n \nA person who applies for access to classified information seeks to enter into a \nfiduciary relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n \nSection 7 of Executive Order (EO) 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall \nbe \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the \nloyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple \nprerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline B - Foreign Influence \n \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Foreign Influence is set out in \nAG \u00b6 6: \n \nForeign contacts and interests, including, but not limited to, business, \nfinancial, and property interests, are a national security concern if they \nresult in divided allegiance. They may also be a national security concern \nif they create circumstances in which the individual may be manipulated or \n\n \n5 \n \ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a \nway inconsistent with U.S. interests or otherwise made vulnerable to \npressure or coercion by any foreign interest. Assessment of foreign \ncontacts and interests should consider the country in which the foreign \ncontact or interest is located, including, but not limited to, considerations \nsuch as whether it is known to target U.S. citizens to obtain classified or \nsensitive information or is associated with a risk of terrorism. \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 7. Four are potentially applicable in this case:   \n \n(a) contact, regardless of method, with a foreign family member, business \nor professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or \nresident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of \nforeign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; \n \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual's obligation to \nprotect classified or sensitive information or technology and the \nindividual's desire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing \nthat information or technology; \n \n(e) shared living quarters with a person or persons, regardless of \ncitizenship status, if that relationship creates a heightened risk of foreign \ninducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; and \n \n(f) substantial business, financial, or property interests in a foreign country, \nor in any foreign owned or foreign-operated business that could subject \nthe individual to a heightened risk of foreign influence or exploitation or \npersonal conflict of interest.  \n \n  \nApplicant\u2019s wife is a Philippine national. He gives her monies each month, which \nshe deposits in a Philippine back account. Applicant only owns property in the \nPhilippines, and plans to retire there. The evidence is sufficient to raise these \ndisqualifying conditions.  \n \n \nAG \u00b6 8 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. I considered all \nof the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 8 including: \n \n(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in \nwhich these persons are located, or the positions or activities of those \npersons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be \nplaced in a position of having to choose between the interests of a foreign \nindividual, group, organization, or government and the interests of the \nUnited States; \n \n\n \n6 \n \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of \nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, or allegiance to the group, \ngovernment, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such deep and \nlongstanding relationships and loyalties in the United States, that the \nindividual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the \nU.S. interest; \n \n(c) contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and \ninfrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign \ninfluence or exploitation; \n \n(d) the foreign contacts and activities are on U.S. Government business or \nare approved by the agency head or designee; and \n \n(f) the value or routine nature of the foreign business, financial, or property \ninterests is such that they are unlikely to result in a conflict and could not \nbe used effectively to influence, manipulate, or pressure the individual. \n \n \nNone of these apply. Apart from his U.S. citizenship and his job position, much of \nApplicant\u2019s emotional interest, and all of his property interest appears to reside in the \nPhilippines. Guideline B is found against Applicant.  \n \nGuideline F - Financial Considerations \n \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG \u00b6 18: \n \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. Four are potentially applicable in this case:   \n \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; \n \n(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so; \n\n \n7 \n \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \n \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired. \n \n  \nApplicant has significant past-due indebtedness. The evidence is sufficient to \nraise these disqualifying conditions.  \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. I considered \nall of the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 including: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control; \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue; \n \n(f) the affluence resulted from a legal source of income; and \n \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax \nauthority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \n \nApplicant\u2019s financial problems are ongoing. He has a long history of \ndelinquencies. Although Applicant can attribute much of his debt to circumstances \nlargely beyond his control, he has about $30,000 in past-due debt that he has yet to \n\n \n8 \n \naddress. He has not demonstrated that future financial problems are unlikely. Mitigation \nunder AG \u00b6 20 has not been established. Guideline F is found against Applicant. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept.  \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuidelines B and F in my whole-person analysis. Overall, the record evidence leaves \nme with questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security \nclearance. For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant has not mitigated the Foreign \nInfluence and Financial Consideration security concerns.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline B:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.b:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.c:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.d:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.b:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline F:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 2.b:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n\n \n9 \n \nSubparagraph 2.c:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 2.d:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 2.e:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 2.f:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant national security eligibility \nand a security clearance.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact. Findings of Fact Applicant admitted to the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, through 1.e, with some explanation. He denied SOR allegation \u00b6 1.f. After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, I make the following findings of fact. Applicant is a 49-year-old employee of a defense contractor. (GX 1 at pages 5 and 12.) He has been employed with the defense contractor since 2010. (GX 1 at page 12.) Applicant emigrated from what is now Ukraine (formerly part of the Soviet Union), and became a U.S. citizen in December of 1991. (GX 1 at pages 6~7, and TR#2 at page 7 lines 18~20.) He is married to a naturalized U.S. citizen who also emigrated from Ukraine. (GX 1 at pages 20~21.) Applicant has four adult children, and a 13 year- old son. (GX 1 at pages 23.) Both Applicant\u2019s father and an uncle, because of their Pentecostal religious beliefs, were sent to Soviet prisons where they perished. (TR#2 at page 8 line 18 to page 9 line 23~27.) Applicant is a \u201cdeacon\u201d for his Pentecostal church, as evidenced by a letter from his \u201cPastor.\u201d (AppX C at page 2.) Applicant net worth in the United States is about $400,000. (TR#2 at page 40 lines 6~17.) 1.a. and 1.d. Applicant brother, who is married to a German national, is a dual national of Germany and Ukraine.

Satterberg, Jr., Esq., Applicant\u2019s Counsel \n \n \nDecember 18, 2018 \n______________ \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \n \nCEFOLA, Richard A., Administrative Judge: \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nOn March 31, 2017, in accordance with DoD Directive 5220.6, as amended \n(Directive), the Department of Defense issued Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) \nalleging facts that raise security concerns under Guideline B.1 The SOR further \ninformed Applicant that, based on information available to the government, DoD \nadjudicators could not make the preliminary affirmative finding it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s security clearance. \n \nApplicant answered the SOR on April 13, 2017, and requested a hearing before \nan administrative judge. (Answer.) The case was assigned to another Administrative \nJudge, and the hearing originally convened on September 15, 2017. (Transcript \n(TR#1.)) As it was unclear if Applicant received the Government\u2019s \u201cdiscovery package,\u201d \nthe hearing was continued. (TR#1 at page 20 line 19 to page 23 line 16.) This matter \n                                                          \n1 I considered the previous Adjudicative Guidelines, effective September 1, 2006, as well as the new \nAdjudicative Guidelines, effective June 8, 2017. My decision would be the same if the case was \nconsidered under the previous Adjudicative Guidelines, effective September 1, 2006. \n\n \n2 \n \nwas subsequently reassigned to me on December 13, 2017. The Defense Office of \nHearings and Appeals (DOHA) had already issued a notice of hearing on October 27, \n2017, scheduling the hearing for January 9, 2018. The hearing was convened as \nrescheduled. The Government reoffered Exhibits (GXs) 1 through 3, which were \nadmitted without objection, and GXs 4 and 5 for Administrative Notice. Applicant \ntestified on his own behalf. The record was left open until February 9, 2018, for receipt \nof additional documentation.  DOHA received the second transcript of the hearing \n(TR#2) on January 18, 2018. Applicant offered three sets of documents, which I marked \nApplicant\u2019s Exhibits (AppXs) A through C, which were admitted without objection. \n \nProcedural Rulings \n \n \nAt the hearing, the Government requested I take administrative notice of certain \nfacts relating to Russia and to Ukraine, identified as GXs 4 and 5.  The documents \nprovide elaboration and context for the summaries. I take administrative notice of the \nfacts as they relate to Ukraine included in the U.S. Government reports. (After a careful \nreview of the evidence, it is clear that Applicant, his siblings and his mother-in-law have \nno connection with Russia.) They are limited to matters of general knowledge, not \nsubject to reasonable dispute. They are set out in the Findings of Fact. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant admitted to the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, through 1.e, with some \nexplanation. He denied SOR allegation \u00b6 1.f. After a thorough and careful review of the \npleadings, exhibits, and testimony, I make the following findings of fact.  \n \n \nApplicant is a 49-year-old employee of a defense contractor. (GX 1 at pages 5 \nand 12.) He has been employed with the defense contractor since 2010. (GX 1 at page \n12.) Applicant emigrated from what is now Ukraine (formerly part of the Soviet Union), \nand became a U.S. citizen in December of 1991. (GX 1 at pages 6~7, and TR#2 at \npage 7 lines 18~20.)  He is married to a naturalized U.S. citizen who also emigrated \nfrom Ukraine. (GX 1 at pages 20~21.) Applicant has four adult children, and a 13 year-\nold son. (GX 1 at pages 23.) Both Applicant\u2019s father and an uncle, because of their \nPentecostal religious beliefs, were sent to Soviet prisons where they perished. (TR#2 at \npage 8 line 18 to page 9 line 23~27.) Applicant is a \u201cdeacon\u201d for his Pentecostal church, \nas evidenced by a letter from his \u201cPastor.\u201d (AppX C at page 2.) Applicant net worth in \nthe United States is about $400,000. (TR#2 at page 40 lines 6~17.) \n \n \n1.a. and 1.d. Applicant brother, who is married to a German national, is a dual \nnational of Germany and Ukraine. (TR#2 at page 16 line 11 to page 17 line 10, and at \npage 17 line 25 to page 26 line 14.) This brother is a Pentecostal missionary, who at \ntimes travels to Russia, but presently resides \u201cin Estonia or Latvia.\u201d (TR#2 at page 26 \nlines 7~14.) Since about 2007, Applicant has provided about $100 each month in \nfinancial support for his missionary brother. (TR#2 at page 16 line 11 to page 17 line 10, \nand at page 17 line 25 to page 26 line 14.) In 2013, Applicant also provided this brother \nwith a lump sum, one-time $5,000 gift. (Id.) \n \n\n \n3 \n \n \n1.b. Applicant\u2019s other brother, and his two sisters, are citizens and residents of \nUkraine. (TR#2 at page 26 line 15 to page 33 line 5.) His brother \u201cis working \nconstruction\u201d in Germany.  (TR#2 at page 26 line 15 to page 27 line 22.) Applicant\u2019s two \nsisters are both housewives living in the Ukraine. One is the mother of \u201c18 kids,\u201d and the \nother \u201chad 11\u201d children. (TR#2 at page 26 line 15 to page 33 line 5.) None of these \nsiblings have any connection with the Ukrainian government. \n \n \n1.c. and 1.e. Applicant\u2019s 77 year-old mother-in-law is a \u201cretired\u201d citizen and \nresident of the Ukraine (TR#2 at page 33 line 7 to page 35 line 12.) Since about 1994, \nApplicant, through his wife, has provided about $100 each month in financial support for \nhis mother-in-law. (TR#2 at page 17 lines 10~21.) Applicant\u2019s mother-in-law has no \nconnection with the Ukrainian government. \n \n \n1.f. Applicant admits that he was investigated in 2015 for possible connections \nwith a Russian/Armenian criminal organization. (TR#2 at page 22 lines 4~19, at page 39 \nline 8 to page 40 line 5, and GX 2.) No such connection was found, and Applicant \ndenies any such connection. (Id.) \n \nNotice \n \n \n \nI take administrative notice of the following facts: Ukraine is a republic with a \nsemi-presidential political system. In 2014, the Ukrainian parliament approved a new \ngovernment, which caused Russia to respond by seizing Ukraine\u2019s Crimean peninsula. \nAdditional unrest occurred in 2014, involving thousands of pro-Russian protesters in \neastern and southern Ukraine. In 2015, a ceasefire agreement established a de facto \ndividing line between Ukrainian government-controlled and separatist-held areas in \nUkraine. (GX 5.) \n \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious \nscrutiny of a number of variables known as the whole-person concept. The \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \n\n \n4 \n \neligibility will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record.  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d  \n \n \nA person who applies for access to classified information seeks to enter into a \nfiduciary relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n \nSection 7 of Executive Order (EO) 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall \nbe \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the \nloyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple \nprerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline B - Foreign Influence \n \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Foreign Influence is set out in \nAG \u00b6 6: \n \nForeign contacts and interests, including, but not limited to, business, \nfinancial, and property interests, are a national security concern if they \nresult in divided allegiance. They may also be a national security concern \nif they create circumstances in which the individual may be manipulated or \ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a \nway inconsistent with U.S. interests or otherwise made vulnerable to \npressure or coercion by any foreign interest. Assessment of foreign \ncontacts and interests should consider the country in which the foreign \ncontact or interest is located, including, but not limited to, considerations \nsuch as whether it is known to target U.S. citizens to obtain classified or \nsensitive information or is associated with a risk of terrorism. \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 7. Two are potentially applicable in this case:   \n \n\n \n5 \n \n(a) contact, regardless of method, with a foreign family member, business \nor professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or \nresident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of \nforeign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; and \n \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual's obligation to \nprotect classified or sensitive information or technology and the \nindividual's desire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing \nthat information or technology. \n \n  \nApplicant has three siblings and a mother-in-law who are citizens of and reside in \nUkraine. The evidence is sufficient to raise these disqualifying conditions.  \n \n \nAG \u00b6 8 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. I considered all \nof the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 8 including: \n \n(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in \nwhich these persons are located, or the positions or activities of those \npersons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be \nplaced in a position of having to choose between the interests of a foreign \nindividual, group, organization, or government and the interests of the \nUnited States; and \n \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of \nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, or allegiance to the group, \ngovernment, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such deep and \nlongstanding relationships and loyalties in the United States, that the \nindividual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the \nU.S. interest. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s loyalties are clearly to the United States, where his immediate family \nlives, and of which he has been a citizen since 1991. Guideline B is found for Applicant.  \n  \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \n\n \n6 \n \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept.  \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuidelines B and C in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were \naddressed under those guidelines, but some warrant additional comment. Applicant is \nwell respected by those who know him in the workplace and in his community. (AppXs \nA~C.) He can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the United States \ndue to his longstanding ties here.  \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant mitigated the Foreign Influence security concerns.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline B:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.b:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.c:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.d:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.e:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.f:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant national security eligibility \nand a security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \n \n \n \n \nRichard A. Cefola \nAdministrative Judge \n",

The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; \nDOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review \nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines \n(AG) effective within the DOD on or after June 8, 2017.  In a July 27, 2017, response, \nApplicant answered the allegations and requested a hearing before a Defense Office of \nHearings and Appeals (DOHA) administrative judge. I was assigned the case on June \n12, 2018.  \nA June 19, 2018, notice was issued which set the hearing for August 23, 2018. \nThe hearing was convened as scheduled. The Government offered four documents, \naccepted into the record without objection as exhibits (Exs.) 1-4. Applicant offered \ntestimony and six exhibits, accepted without objection as Exs. A-F. The Government \nobjected to a seventh offering, a report of a polygraph examination. The objection was \nsustained and the summary was not accepted. (Tr. 20-25) The record was held open \n\n \n \n \n \n2 \nthrough July 5, 2018, in the event either party wished to submit additional materials. The \ntranscript (Tr.) of the proceeding was received on September 4, 2018.  \n \nLacking objection, Applicant\u2019s request to extend the time period for supplemental \nexhibits through October 15, 2018, was granted. On September 26, 2018, Applicant \nsubmitted a package of 26 additional exhibits. The Government objected to two items \n(numbers 24 and 25). With no response forthcoming within 15 days, the objections were \nsustained. The materials were accepted as Exs. G1-G23 and G26). The record was \nclosed on October 15, 2018. Based on the testimony, materials, and record as a whole, \nI find Applicant mitigated sexual behavior, criminal conduct, and personal conduct \nsecurity concerns. \n \n     Findings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant is a 50-year-old graduate of one of the U.S. military academies. He \nhonorably served in the U.S. military for approximately 27 years. He is presently a \nsenior account manager. In about 2003, he married a woman with six biological children \nfrom a previous marriage, including three stepdaughters who were then aged 9, 7, and \n4. The couple has since added two children of their own.  \n \n \nThe eldest of Applicant\u2019s wife\u2019s daughters had a strong bond with her biological \nfather and, starting early on, a strained relationship with Applicant. Although Applicant \ndid not start a romance with the mother until after the mother had divorced her first \nhusband, the girl blamed Applicant for the failure of her parents\u2019 marriage. (Tr. 60) She \nalso did not like that Applicant was a disciplinarian. (Tr. 57). Meanwhile, she was having \ndifficult times fitting in with the other girls at church and at school, and was often bullied. \n(Tr. 59) The child also had the stress or adjusting to Type 1 diabetes, and trauma that \nwas the result of a life-threatening car accident a couple of years earlier. (Tr. 59-60) She \nwas known to suffer from depression. (Tr. 62) She wanted to go back to her former \nstate and life with her natural father.  \n \nAt age 14, amidst all these problems, this eldest daughter was sleeping on the \nground in a basement bedroom one night. (Tr. 59) She was positioned on the floor next \nto her sleeping sister\u2019s bed. Applicant entered to look in on the children. In reaching out \nto assure she was well-covered and tucked in, his hand made contact with her \nbackside, feeling to her \u201clike a grab over her clothing.\u201d (Tr. 55, 58, 64) The next day, the \ngirl was brought home from school for being distraught. The girl \u201cblew up\u201d at Applicant, \nbut did not accuse him of anything. A day later, the mother read a passage in the girl\u2019s \njournal mentioning the touch. \u201cBy then, [the girl had] decided to move [across country \nwith her biological father].\u201d (Tr 56) Over time, the daughter\u2019s story has changed multiple \ntimes. (see, e.g., Exs. G10-G13; Ex. 3 at 12-13) She later acknowledged that the touch \n\u201cwasn\u2019t a sexual thing.\u201d (Tr. 58)  \n \nIn 2011, the girl subsequently chose to live with Applicant during college despite \nthe availability of GI Bill benefits that could have paid for her housing elsewhere. (Tr. 61) \nNo formal steps regarding this girl\u2019s allegation were ever pursued or instituted. (Tr. 71) \n\n \n \n \n \n3 \nAt a recent family funeral, this oldest child \u201ccame up, gave [him] a hug . . . even before, \nshe was not much into that, but she came up and gave [him] a hug.\u201d (Tr. 73) They were \nalso last known to be exchanging Facebook posts and emails. (Tr. 73) \n \n \nIn 2011, the middle child of Applicant\u2019s three stepdaughters traveled cross \ncountry to stay with her biological father for part of the summer. The girl enjoyed life with \nher biological father in a markedly different region, where her now-adult elder sister had \nlived since 2009 and where this girl had spent her early years. Also residing in the area \nwas an aunt and a cousin, who was the girl\u2019s best friend. The aunt had never approved \nof Applicant, resented his taking his wife and his wife\u2019s children away from her and the \nbiological father, and \u201ceventually was convinced to help [the biological father] to get his \nchildren back under his complete care. . . .\u201d (Ex. 9)   \n \nThe middle girl initially delayed her relocation by not coming home at summer\u2019s \nend. Then, the girl and the aunt disclosed that the child had \u201csuppressed memories\u201d \nindicating Applicant had molested her. She told this to her biological father, who was not \non good terms with Applicant. (Tr. 54) It is unknown whether this middle child had \nactually read her elder sister\u2019s journal or simply knew the circumstances of her \ndeparture from Applicant\u2019s home three years earlier. (Tr. 68-69) \n \nThere was subsequent concern about the middle child returning to live with \nApplicant. The girl\u2019s biological father reported his daughter\u2019s \u201csuppressed memories\u201d to \nthe local police. This stepdaughter later detailed to county sheriff officials instances \nwhere Applicant supposedly touched her breasts and genitals in a manner \u201cessentially \nvery strikingly familiar to [her elder sister\u2019s] allegation from 2009,\u201d wherein Applicant \nwas to have touched the sleeping girl after moving her blanket, then tucked her in for \nthe night. (Tr. 66) She also suggested that her younger sister had been similarly \nabused. (see, e.g., Ex. 3 at 6; Ex. G(18)) \n \nAfter an investigation and review, no action was taken by the police, but this \nmiddle child remained with her biological father for the rest of her high school education. \nThere, \u201cshe joined the same choir group, she . . . went to work at the same pizza place, \nshe did almost everything step by step that [her elder sister] did when she moved. . . .\u201d \n(Tr. 67, 69-70) Last seen a year ago, this stepdaughter and Applicant were on speaking \nterms during a family visit. (Tr. 73)  \n \nThe youngest stepdaughter does not believe her sisters\u2019 versions of the facts \nconcerning the Applicant. She has consistently defended Applicant since at least 2012. \n(Exs. 7-9) She describes him as a committed member of their church, patriotic, patient, \neven-tempered, and a loving father who \u201cprovides just punishments.\u201d (Ex. 9) She \ndescribes Applicant and her mother as \u201cloving parents.\u201d (Exs. 7-9) She does not believe \nher elder sister\u2019s story, noting that this sibling \u201cwould have reacted sooner\u201d if the alleged \nincident had really occurred. (Ex. G8) She noted that this sibling originally questioned \nwhether the incident had ever really happened. (Ex. G8)  \n \n\n \n \n \n \n4 \nThe youngest stepdaughter also noted that the elder sibling told at least two \nversions of what happened: \u201cin one, my dear mother walked in; in the other, I told \n[mother of the incident along] with [my elder sister]. Two stories hints that this is a \nfalsehood.\u201d (Ex. G8; see also Tr. 81-82) As for the former version, she noted \u201cthe very \nidea that my mother would stand by and watch her children be practically raped is \ncomplete rubbish.\u201d (Ex. G8) The elder sister had confided to the youngest girl that she \nhad actually wanted to go to be with their father because \u201cshe was lonely and did not \nenjoy life in [their state], especially because she left many friends behind when [they] \nmoved . . . . The change was too drastic for her. She also in her diary has written how \nshe hates flying back and forth every school break; how she wished she had a normal \nlife in a permanent home. I know she didn\u2019t go to [their biological father] for a safe \nhaven.\u201d (Ex. G8) In the alternative, the youngest girl suggests that, given her eldest \nsister\u2019s track record of having bad dreams, that such a dream could have also been \nused as a basis for manipulation by her cousin or aunt. (Ex. G9) \n \nThe youngest child also related that Applicant often tucked the children in. \nHowever, after the allegation waged by the elder stepdaughter, he stopped. (Ex.G 8; Tr. \n73) Overall, she noted that Applicant always tried to avoid being \u201ccreepy\u201d or an \u201cevil \nstepparent.\u201d (Ex. G9) This stepdaughter also reported that the aunt \u201coften tried to tear \napart [my] family and others. She would tell the kids to lie to the school or officials about \nour parents [Applicant and his wife]. . . . She may hate my parents.\u201d (Ex. G9) This \nstepdaughter\u2019s support of Applicant is corroborated by her mother, Applicant\u2019s wife. (Ex. \nG15) Today, the three stepdaughters are all adults living independently apart from \nApplicant. \n \n \nRegarding the incidents allegedly involving the oldest and middle stepdaughters, \na report from military legal/social services was deemed in favor of Applicant, with the \nfavorable testimony of the oldest and youngest girls found to be substantiated. There \nwas no referral to the sheriff or for criminal proceedings. Although not introduced into \nevidence, other documentation reflects that a family advocacy study adopted the stories \nby the oldest and the middle girl and found against Applicant, finding their tales \nsubstantiated. There is no documentary evidence reflecting a recommendation on \ncriminal action was issued, although it was noted that the youngest girl remained \ncontentedly in the care of Applicant. The unfavorable conclusion of the family advocacy \nprogram was the basis for the pending allegation in this matter. \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \n\n \n \n \n \n5 \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to the AG, \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept, each of which must be fully considered in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. Any doubt \nconcerning personnel being considered for national security eligibility and will be \nresolved in favor of the national security. In reaching this decision, I have drawn only \nthose conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the record evidence. \nUnder the Directive, the Government must present evidence to establish controverted \nfacts alleged in the SOR. Under the Directive, an applicant is responsible for presenting \nwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by \napplicant or proven by Department Counsel and has the ultimate burden of persuasion \nto obtain a favorable security decision.  \n \nA person seeking access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government based on trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours. Decisions include consideration of the possible risk an \napplicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nDecisions are in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination \nas to the loyalty of the applicant.   \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline D, Sexual Behavior  \n \nAG \u00b6 12 sets forth the security concern as follows:  \n \nSexual behavior that involves a criminal offense; reflects a lack of \njudgment or discretion; or may subject the individual to undue influence of \ncoercion, exploitation, or duress. These issues, together or individually, \nmay \nraise \nquestions \nabout \nan \nindividual's \njudgment, \nreliability, \ntrustworthiness, and ability to protect classified or sensitive information. \nSexual behavior includes conduct occurring in person or via audio, visual, \nelectronic, or written transmission. No adverse inference concerning the \nstandards in this Guideline may be raised solely on the basis of the sexual \norientation of the individual.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s hand made contact with his middle stepdaughter\u2019s buttock one night \nas she slept, leading to the involvement of military legal/social services, a family \nadvocacy program, and the police. The family advocacy program found that two of three \nallegations raised were substantiated. Those allegations both involved similar fact \npatterns concerning Applicant\u2019s eldest and middle stepdaughters.   \n \nAG \u00b6 13 provides conditions that could raise a disqualifying condition:  \n \n\n \n \n \n \n6 \nAG \u00b6 13(a):  sexual behavior of a criminal nature . . . ; \n \nAG \u00b6 13(b): pattern of compulsive, self-destructive, or high-risk sexual \nbehavior that the individual is unable to stop; \n \nAG \u00b6 13(c): sexual behavior that causes an individual to be vulnerable to \ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and  \n \nAG \u00b6 13(d): sexual behavior of a public nature or that reflects lack of \ndiscretion or judgment.  \n \nUnder these circumstances, AG \u00b6 13(a) - AG \u00b6 13(c) apply. \n \nIn addition, AG \u00b6 14 provides the following possible mitigating conditions:  \n \nAG \u00b6 14(a): the behavior occurred prior to or during adolescence and \nthere is no evidence of subsequent conduct of similar nature;  \n \nAG \u00b6 14(b): the sexual behavior happened so long ago, so infrequently, or \nunder such unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur and does not \ncast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or \njudgment; \n \nAG \u00b6 14(c): the behavior no longer serves as a basis for coercion, \nexploitation, or duress; \n \nAG \u00b6 14(d): the sexual behavior is strictly private, consensual, and \ndiscreet; and  \n \nAG \u00b6 14(e): the individual has successfully completed an appropriate \nprogram of treatment, or is currently enrolled in one, has demonstrated \nongoing and consistent compliance with the treatment plan, and/or has \nreceived a favorable prognosis from a qualified mental health professional \nindicating the behavior is readily controllable with treatment.  \n \nThe behavior at issue occurred seven or more years ago. Once it became an \nissue, Applicant ceased checking in on the girls at night or tucking them in. The females \ninvolved are now adults living outside of the region where Applicant resides. There is no \nother indication involving any questionable actions by Applicant regarding the other six, \nyounger, children, or any other individuals of any age or sex. Applicant has the full \nsupport of his youngest stepdaughter and his wife. He has been candid and forthcoming \nabout his family and these incidents since the beginning.  \n \nIt is true that one of three investigations found the stories of two of the three \nstepdaughters to be substantiated. No further action, however, was taken despite its \nconclusion and the youngest girl continued to live with her stepfather, the Applicant. The \n\n \n \n \n \n7 \nfacts in this matter have been fully vetted through multiple criminal or administrative \nfunctions. Of all the several characters in the drama, only the testimonies of Applicant \nand the youngest stepdaughter remain consistent; in contrast, the tales told by the older \ntwo stepdaughters have varied and evolved almost from the beginning. Moreover, \nApplicant\u2019s subtle suggestion that the two older stepdaughters were troubled teens \nplotting a way to go back to a happier time and place In light of these facts is not \nunpersuasive. Therefore, I find AG \u00b6\u00b6 14(a)-(c) apply.  \n \nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct \n \nThe concern raised by criminal conduct is set out in AG \u00b6 30:  \n \nCriminal activity creates doubt about a person's judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person's ability \nor willingness to comply with laws, rules and regulations. \n \n \nThe facts at issue under this guideline are the same as those at issue under the \nprevious guideline and are adopted herein. Those facts raise disqualifying condition:  \n \nAG \u00b6 31(b): evidence (including, but not limited to, a credible allegation, \nan admission, and matters of official record) of criminal conduct, \nregardless of whether the individual was formally charged, prosecuted, or \nconvicted.  \n \n \nThe following mitigating conditions are potentially relevant:   \n \nAG \u00b6 32(a): so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior \nhappened, or it happened under such unusual circumstances, that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment,  \n \nAG \u00b6 32(c):  evidence that the person did not commit the offense; and \n \nAG \u00b6 32(d): there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including but not \nlimited to, the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, \nrestitution, compliance with the terms of parole or probation, job training or \nhigher education, good employment record, or constructive community \ninvolvement.   \n \n \nFor the same reasons noted under Guideline D, above, I find AG \u00b6 32(a), AG \u00b6 \n32(c), and AG \u00b6 32(d) apply. \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct  \n \n \nThe security concern for personal conduct is set out in AG \u00b6 15: \n \n\n \n \n \n \n8 \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. The following disqualifying condition is potentially applicable: \n \nAG \u00b6 16(e): personal conduct, or concealment of information about one\u2019s \nconduct, that creates a vulnerability to exploitation, or duress by a foreign \nintelligence entity or other individual or group. Such conduct includes: (1) \nengaging in activities which, if known, could affect the person\u2019s personal, \nprofessional, or community standing. . . .  \n \nThe same facts noted under the two previous guidelines are equally applicable \nunder this section. Therefore, AG \u00b6 16(e) applies. Moreover, I have considered these \nfacts in light of the AG \u00b6 17 mitigating conditions. I find the following potentially \napplicable: \n \nAG \u00b6 17(c): the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the \nbehavior is so infrequent, or it happened under such unique \ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the \nindividual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; and \n \nAG \u00b6 17(e): the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate \nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress.  \n \nFor the same reasons stated above under both of the previously discussed \nguidelines, I find these two mitigating conditions apply. I find this conclusion bolstered \nby the fact Applicant ceased checking in on the children in the evening so as not to \nhave his paternal actions misunderstood. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d).  \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the \npotentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and \ncircumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under the three \napplicable guidelines in my analysis of Applicant\u2019s whole-person. I also considered \nApplicant\u2019s testimony, materials, and references.  \n\n \n \n \n \n9 \n \nThe facts in this case reflect that Applicant\u2019s eldest and middle stepdaughters \nwere unhappy with the milieu into which their mother\u2019s marriage placed them, far from \ntheir prior residence, biological father, school, church, and friends. Both girls very much \nwanted to return to their old lives and their old haunts. The oldest sister\u2019s version of an \ninappropriate touching has varied over the years, and rational alternative explanations \nhave been explored that further raise questions over her original allegation of abuse. \nFurthermore, the lack of candor by the two older girls; their fundamental dislike of \nApplicant; and the dislike of Applicant by the girls\u2019 aunt which could well have \ntransitioned into unconscionable coaching, provide substantial doubt that the alleged \nconduct actually occurred as described.    \n  \n \nThe middle girl\u2019s version of abuse came at a particularly difficult time in her life. It \ninvolved a scenario similar to that alleged by the elder sister, a scenario she saw \nsuccessfully relocate her elder sister back to their former home state of residence. The \nmiddle girl\u2019s version of abuse was less subtle, and she even falsely asserted her \nyounger sister had similarly been violated. With regard to all these allegations, the \nyoungest stepdaughter\u2019s information credibly refutes or questions both the claims and \nthe motives, of not just the girls, but their aunt and cousin, as well.  \n \n \nThe SOR allegations are correct in noting that one investigative body found that \nthe older and middle sisters\u2019 stories were substantiated. Another investigation, however, \nfound against the middle sister and in favor of testimony by the youngest girl and the \n(revised) version of the elder sister\u2019s tale. Taken together, in historical context, and \nupon review of subsequent interactions between Applicant, his wife, and the sisters, the \nyoungest girl\u2019s theories and explanations make the most sense out of this mixture of \nvarying facts, both then and now. More importantly, they support Applicant\u2019s assertion \nthat there was no intentional criminal or sexual abuse inflicted on either girl. Based on \nthe documentary evidence and testimony provided, I conclude sexual behavior, criminal \nconduct, and personal conduct security concerns are mitigated.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline D:  \n \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:   \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline J:  \n \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \nParagraph 3, Guideline J:  \n \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 3.a:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n\n \n \n \n \n10\n \n \n \n \n \n     Conclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant a security clearance. \nEligibility for access to classified information is granted. \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nArthur E.

He has earned a bachelor\u2019s degree and is presently working on a master\u2019s degree. Applicant is married with two minor children. Although born in the United States, Applicant\u2019s family is from a foreign country, where he spent many years in school.3 After five years of diligent study at university in the United States, Applicant thought he had graduated in the spring of 2000. He had timely completed his final semester\u2019s coursework and received final grades for his courses. He applied and was permitted to participate in spring commencement exercises. He rented his cap and gown, and received his graduation token or pendant when his name was called. Shortly thereafter, he began taking graduate courses for about a semester before he decided to start working full time.4 In 2001, he completed a security clearance application indicating he had received a bachelor\u2019s degree in May 2000. In 2003, Applicant again applied to take graduate courses. This time, he was told he could not enroll in graduate courses because he did not have a bachelor\u2019s degree.

He also requested a hearing before a Defense Office of Hearings and \nAppeals (DOHA) administrative judge. I was assigned the case on February 22, 2018. A \nhearing originally scheduled for May 9, 2018, was cancelled to give Applicant more time \nto retain an attorney. A May 10, 2918, notice, setting the hearing for June 11, 2018 was \nissued. The hearing was convened as scheduled.  \nThe Government offered eight documents, accepted into the record as exhibits \n(Exs. 1-8). Exs. 1-5 and 7-8 were accepted without objection while Ex. 6 was accepted \n1 The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry \n(February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security \nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines \n(AG) effective within the DOD on or after June 8, 2017. \n03/15/2019\n\n \n \n \n \n2\nover objection.2 (Tr. 11-17) Applicant gave testimony, introduced a live witness, and \nproffered nine exhibits, accepted without objection as Exs. A-I. The record was held \nopen through July 2, 2018, for submission of additional items; this was extended to July \n23, 2018, at Applicant\u2019s request. The transcript (Tr.) was received on June 20, 2018. \nThree character references and a page of argument were timely received and accepted \ninto the record as Exs. J-M without objection. The record was then closed on July 23, \n2018. Based on the testimony, materials, and record as a whole, I find Applicant failed \nto mitigate personal conduct security concerns. \n \n     Findings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant is a 41-year-old senior professional engineer who has worked for the \nsame employer for four years. He has earned a bachelor\u2019s degree and is presently \nworking on a master\u2019s degree. Applicant is married with two minor children.  Although \nborn in the United States, Applicant\u2019s family is from a foreign country, where he spent \nmany years in school.3 \n \n \nAfter five years of diligent study at university in the United States, Applicant \nthought he had graduated in the spring of 2000. He had timely completed his final \nsemester\u2019s coursework and received final grades for his courses. He applied and was \npermitted to participate in spring commencement exercises. He rented his cap and \ngown, and received his graduation token or pendant when his name was called. Shortly \nthereafter, he began taking graduate courses for about a semester before he decided to \nstart working full time.4 In 2001, he completed a security clearance application indicating \nhe had received a bachelor\u2019s degree in May 2000. \n \nIn 2003, Applicant again applied to take graduate courses. This time, he was told \nhe could not enroll in graduate courses because he did not have a bachelor\u2019s degree. \nFor years, he tried to reconcile this confusion, which appeared to be related to money \nowed the university. It appears between 2000 and 2003, whatever issues barring his \nunconditional graduation that existed had become a major obstacle.  \n \nMeanwhile, in 2003, Applicant married his pregnant girlfriend, the couple had a \nchild, his wife went back to school, and Applicant needed to find a way to support his \nfamily. Specifically, \u201che needed to be able to earn the amount he should have been \nentitled to for finishing his bachelor\u2019s and master\u2019s degree which he would\u2019ve finished at \nthe time had he not been denied the bachelor\u2019s degree.\u201d (Tr. 19)  \n                                                          \n2 Regarding the objections to Ex. 6, it was taken into evidence but is accordingly given appropriate weight \nunder the circumstances. It is also noted that Applicant volunteered portions of the exhibit during his \ndirect testimony. \n \n3 This fact is potentially relevant given any cultural or linguistic issues that may have arisen with regard to \nGuideline E. However, it is also noted that his several siblings are all graduates of U.S. universities. \n \n4 SOR allegation 1.a. Applicant was not enrolled in the graduate program, but the school permitted \nstudents to take two or three course offerings before applying for acceptance into the program. \n \n\n \n \n \n \n3\nIn 2006, Applicant falsified multiple documents from the university indicating he \nhad both a bachelor\u2019s degree and a master\u2019s degree in engineering.5 (Tr. 46, 70) He \nthen used those documents to apply for a job, which was later offered and accepted.6 In \n2009, Applicant\u2019s falsity was caught during a government background investigation.7 \nApplicant confessed the truth to both his employer and the government. Applicant\u2019s \nmanager expressed his displeasure at these developments, noting he needed a degree \nto continue with the company. The two discussed the time Applicant should resign and \nfinish his degree. (Tr. 19) There is no documentary evidence reflecting a formal letter of \nresignation or notice. He did not want to attend an up-coming meeting where he would \nnow be viewed as only a high school graduate. A week later, however, he received a \ncertified letter reflecting that upper management had made the decision to terminate \nhim. Apparently, word of this agreement was not well-spread. Around that time, a co-\nworker wrote an email to another colleague noting that Applicant had simply \n\u201cdisappeared\u201d over a week prior and was no longer working at the company. (Ex. D) \n \nAfter he completed the bachelor\u2019s degree, Applicant knew he wanted to obtain a \ngraduate degree from the same institution. He updated his resume to indicate a \nmaster\u2019s degree with an anticipated graduation date in the future. He was not then \nenrolled in the master\u2019s program. That section of the resume, submitted to his next \nemployer in October 2006, stated: \n \nEDUCATION: MS (Engineering; University; City) May 2003 \n   \n  BS (Engineering; University; City) May 20008 \n \nIn 2014, Applicant submitted a resume to his then-prospective employer that stated: 9 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n      EDUCATION \n                                                         (University; City) \n \n \n \n      Master of Science in Electrical Engineering \n \n \n \n \n           Expected May 2018 \n \n \n    Concentration in Communications and Signal Processing \n \n \n                                                          \n5 When asked why he also falsified having earned a master\u2019s degree, Applicant stated: \u201cI would have \nbeen done with a master\u2019s [degree] by that time had things not gone the way they did at [his \nundergraduate school] the first time. And I spoke to the hiring manager . . . and I realized having a \nmaster\u2019s degree would make [my] case a lot better.\u201d (Tr. 48) \n \n6 SOR allegation 1.b. These included falsified academic transcripts, resume, and application. \n \n7 Compare Ex. 6 at 3, Applicant noted that he \u201cmisled the [company] into believing I had a college degree \nfrom [ ] This came to light during my 2008 (5 year) investigation to renew my clearance.\u201d (emphasis \nadded) \n \n8 Ex. 3. \n \n9 Ex. 4. \n \n\n \n \n \n \n4\n \n \n \n \n \n   (University; City) \n \n \n \n    Bachelor of Science in Electrical Engineering \n \n \n \n \n \n         May 2013 \n \nIn fact, at the time, Applicant was not enrolled in a master\u2019s program at that university.10 \n \nApplicant testified that he did not mean his resume wording to imply he was \nactually enrolled in a master\u2019s program at that university. (Tr. 53) He was told by a \n\u201cprofessional\u201d that this was but a way to let prospective employers \u201cknow that you intend \nto get a master\u2019s degree or you\u2019re taking graduate level course [sic] and you intend to \nget a master\u2019s degree.\u201d (Tr. 53) He was told that the wording \u201clet\u2019s them know you don\u2019t \nhave a degree but you have started the process.\u201d (Tr. 54) It is unclear how not having \nfirst been enrolled in the program started the process of earning a graduate degree. \nLater, Applicant told the hiring partner that he was not yet in the master\u2019s degree \nprogram. (Ex. B) Ultimately, Applicant was offered his present position, where he has \nbeen a well-regarded employee. \n \nIn July 2014, Applicant certified a security clearance application (SCA) in which \nhe stated he left his employer in 2009 by mutual agreement, rather than by unilateral \ntermination by upper management.11 Applicant maintains that he believes the facts \nreflect that the agreement between himself and his manager show his departure was \nmeant to be as they had contemplated: that he would leave the office and return to \nschool. A week later, he received the certified letter from higher management that he \nwas terminated for violating company policy. No formal charges were filed against him. \n(Tr. 61) He feels it is unfair that the employer should be able to dictate the terms of his \ndeparture from their company after he and his immediate manager had already \ndiscussed the issue. (Tr. 62) \n \nDuring a personal subject interview in May 2015, Applicant stated that he was \nonly asked whether he had a college degree after he was hired in 2006. The interviewer \nnever mentioned the falsified application, academic transcript, and resume included in \nhis application submission documents.12 Applicant points to Ex. E to show the \ninterviewer only made notes regarding Applicant\u2019s comments regarding the fact he did \nnot have the degree. Because the interviewer\u2019s notes do not inquire about the falsified \napplication, transcript, and resume, Applicant believes he did his duty and the \ninterviewer failed to ask about those documents. He takes no responsibility for \nneglecting to disclose the falsifications he omitted or obscured. In that same interview, \nApplicant failed to disclose that he was terminated by management, not simply left by \n                                                          \n10 SOR allegation 1.c. Applicant is still working on this master\u2019s degree at this time.  \n \n11 SOR allegation 1.d. In that application, Applicant did note that he left under allegations of misconduct. \n \n12 SOR allegation 1.e. \n \n\n \n \n \n \n5\nmutual agreement.13 He did so because he still does not view management\u2019s letter to \nbe the formal or official action for his departure or for violating company policy. \n \nAside from issues related to personal conduct, three delinquent debts are noted \nin the SOR (2.a-2.c). They are student loans amounting to approximately $41,200. At \nsome point after the summer of 2000, Applicant got a job that would enable him to make \npayments on his student loans. He then started making payments on them after they \nwere no longer in deferment status. When subject to a layoff in December 2001, \nApplicant became delinquent on the loans and they went back into deferment. When \nagain employed, he resumed payments until June 2009, when he again defaulted on \nthe loans after leaving a job. (Tr. 32) He then returned to school later that year while \nunemployed, and did so without taking any additional loans.  \n \nThe family relied on Applicant\u2019s wife\u2019s income and Applicant\u2019s retirement account \nand investments, which were liquidated. Applicant attributes his acquisition of the \ndelinquent debts to financial stress experienced during this nearly five-year time span \nstudying and not working. He has since had one loan put into rehabilitation and the \nother two consolidated with that loan. Therefore, he is now dealing with only one lender. \n(Tr. 37) Applicant provided a payment history going back to May 2018. (Exs. F-G) The \nlender is now being paid $252.72 a month for his loan balance. The loans are now in \ntimely repayment. (Exs. F-G)   \n \n \nPolicies \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision after a conscientious \nscrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole-person concept. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. Any doubt \nconcerning personnel being considered for national security eligibility and will be \nresolved in favor of the national security. In reaching this decision, I have drawn only \nthose conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the record evidence. \nUnder the Directive, the Government must present evidence to establish controverted \nfacts alleged in the SOR. Under the Directive, an applicant is responsible for presenting \nwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by \n                                                          \n13 SOR allegation 1.f. \n \n\n \n \n \n \n6\napplicant or proven by Department Counsel and has the ultimate burden of persuasion \nto obtain a favorable security decision.  \n \nA person seeking access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government based on trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours. The Government reposes a high degree of trust and \nconfidence in those to whom it grants access to classified information. Decisions include \nconsideration of the possible risk an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to \nsafeguard classified information. Decisions are in terms of the national interest and shall \nin no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant.   \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct  \n \n \nThe security concern for personal conduct is set out in AG \u00b6 15: \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise security concerns and may be \ndisqualifying. Here, Applicant denied making certain falsifications or strategic omissions \non his SCAs, on job application materials, and during a May 2015 personal subject \ninterview. If Applicant\u2019s answers and materials were intentionally false or meant to \nmislead or misrepresent, the following disqualifying conditions could apply:  \n \nAG \u00b6 16(a) deliberate omission, concealment or falsification of relevant \nfacts from any personnel security questionnaire, personal history \nstatement, or similar form used to conduct investigations, determine \nemployment qualifications, award benefits or status, determine security \nclearance eligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities; \n \nAG \u00b6 16(b) deliberately providing false or misleading information; or \nconcealing or omitting information, concerning relevant facts to an \nemployer, investigator, security official, competent medical or mental \nhealth professional involved in making a recommendation relevant to a \nnational security eligibility determination, or other official government \nrepresentative; and \n \n AG \u00b6 16(e) personal conduct, or concealment of information about one\u2019s \nconduct, that creates a vulnerability to exploitation, or duress by a foreign \nintelligence entity or other individual or group. Such conduct includes: (1) \nengaging in activities which, if known, could affect the person\u2019s personal, \nprofessional, or community standing. . . .  \n\n \n \n \n \n7\n \nI find that several of the untrue, inconsistent, or omitted facts were intentionally \nput forth to set Applicant in a better light. The first issue arose on Applicant\u2019s 2001 SCA, \nin which he wrote he had graduated from a particular university with a bachelor\u2019s degree \nin May 2000. Applicant believed he had graduated at that ceremony because he had \ncompleted his coursework, was given permission to attend commencement exercises, \nwalked the stage in cap and gown, and was given a token of some sort. Then \nunbeknownst to him was the fact he apparently had an outstanding financial issue that \nhad to be addressed before he could formally be considered a graduate.  \n \n \nApparently, Applicant was unaware that occasions arise when one is given the \nopportunity to go through the motions of graduation with one\u2019s peers before all \ngraduation criteria have been met, such as when there is an unpaid balance, health \nissue, or missing academic credit. Apparently, Applicant failed to cross his \u201ct\u201ds and dot \nhis \u201ci\u201ds with this regard in the intervening year before he completed the SCA. On the \nother hand, it is not implausible that this situation was the result of naivet\u00e9. (SOR 1.a) \nApplicant fully admits, however, that he submitted a falsified application package to a \nprospective employer in 2006, a package including a falsified application, falsified \nacademic transcript, and a false and misleading resume. (SOR 1.b) \n \n \nAs part of an application package for a job in 2014, Applicant detailed under \n\u201cEDUCATION,\u201d the name and city of a university, \u201cMaster of Science in Electrical \nEngineering, Expected May 2018, Concentration in Communications and Signal \nProcessing. (SOR 1.c) Applicant dismisses this entry as merely a showing of his \nintention to pursue that degree, a tip-off to the prospective employer that it was his \nimmediate aim. He testified a professional gave him this explanation.  \n \nI disagree, however, as to how that advice was meant or implemented. Inclusion \nof an expected or anticipated graduation date for a future degree is predicated not on a \ndesire or hope, but on significant steps \u2013 ie. enrollment in the program and, perhaps, \nsome completed coursework. Here, Applicant was not enrolled in the master\u2019s program \nat that particular university. There is no documentary evidence reflecting that his \nenrollment had been initiated or was guaranteed. While Applicant was no doubt firm in \nhis commitment to seek that degree, obstacles to its fruition were still potentially ahead \nat that point. Given the conviction of his testimony on this point, however, I find he relied \non and misunderstood professional advice.  \n \n \nOn his July 2014 SCA, Applicant wrote that he left a job in 2009 by mutual \nagreement. (SOR 1.d) He maintains that is the fact, and stresses it despite other facts \nsurrounding his departure. He needed a bachelor\u2019s degree to maintain the job. He \ndiscussed his lack of a degree with immediate management and it was decided that he \nwould resign and pursue his bachelor\u2019s degree. Then, apparently, he disappeared; co-\nworker\u2019s were concerned at his disappearance. Applicant was embarrassed about \npotentially attending a meeting where it could be disclosed he only had a high school \ndiploma. A week after meeting with his manager, he received a certified letter from \nupper management that he was terminated for violating company policy.  \n\n \n \n \n \n8\nApplicant thinks it is unfair a company can dictate how his departure is \ncharacterized. There is no documentary evidence, however, showing that he formally \ndisputed or appealed this designation with human resources or a higher manager. \nInstead, he chose to move on accepting only his version of the facts. To do so was not \nonly at his own peril, but it shows a lack of acceptance to the facts here.  \n \n \nFinally, in a personal interview from May 2015, Applicant discussed the truth \nabout his alleged bachelor\u2019s degree graduation date, but failed to disclose the fact he \nhad also submitted to that employer falsified application materials, a falsified academic \ntranscript, and a falsified resume. (SOR 1.d) Applicant points to the investigator\u2019s notes \nand shows that there is no query by the investigator concerning those admittedly \nfalsified documents. Applicant misses the point. In concealing the information, the \ninvestigator had no basis upon which to pose questions regarding those documents. \nThis process demands honesty and candor; it relies on an applicant being forthcoming. \nHere, Applicant failed to meet those standards, and superior judgment should have told \nhim these were not insignificant or irrelevant facts. Moreover, in that same interview, \nApplicant again failed to discuss his termination in 2009 by upper management for a \npolicy violation, instead continuing to adhere to his original position that the first action \u2013 \ndiscussion with his immediate manager \u2013 trumped the official action taken by the \ncompany\u2019s hierarchy after he ceased reporting for work. (1.e)   \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nUnder Guideline F, AG \u00b6 18 sets forth that the security concern under this \nguideline is that failure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to \nabide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about an individual\u2019s \nreliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified or sensitive information.  \n \nHere, the Government offered documentary evidence reflecting that Applicant \nhas three delinquent student loans. This is sufficient to invoke financial considerations \ndisqualifying conditions:  \n \nAG \u00b6 19(a): inability to satisfy debts; \n \nAG \u00b6 19(b): unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the inability to do so; and \n \nAG \u00b6 19(c): a history of not meeting financial obligations. \n \nFour conditions could mitigate the finance related security concerns posed here:  \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not \ncast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \n\n \n \n \n \n9\n \nAG \u00b6 20(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were \nlargely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control; and \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to \nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \n \n \n                    The student loans at issue have been in and out of deferment on more than one \noccasion as various factors interrupted Applicant\u2019s education. The credit reports in \nevidence were apparently pulled during a period when Applicant was technically \ndelinquent on those accounts. It is hard to attribute their delinquency to conditions \nbeyond Applicant\u2019s control if he truly left employment simply to return to school full time; \nif he was terminated from his job, AG \u00b6 20(b) could apply in part, although he presented \ndeficient evidence showing he acted responsibly during that period.  \n \n                    Moreover, there is no documentary evidence that Applicant tried to address these \ndebts before the issuance of the SOR in June 2017. Indeed, the payment history \nsubmitted only goes back to May 2018. Given the ultimate disposition of this case, \nhowever, and the fact these student loans are now in repayment, I find AG \u00b6 20(b) and \nAG \u00b6 20(d) both apply in part. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the her  \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d). Here, I have considered those \nfactors. I am also mindful that, under AG \u00b6 2(a), the ultimate determination of whether to \ngrant eligibility for a security clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment \nbased on careful consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.        \n \nApplicant is a 41-year-old senior professional engineer who has worked for the \nsame employer for four years. He has earned a bachelor\u2019s degree and is presently \nworking on a master\u2019s degree. Married, Applicant has two minor children. Over the past \nyears, Applicant has been in and out of college. As a result, his student loans have \nbeen in and out of deferment, rehabilitation, and in repayment. Last year, he had his \nthree student loans consolidated. They are now in timely repayment. \n \n\n \n \n \n \n10 \nWhat is most troublesome with Applicant\u2019s case is the matter of various \ninaccuracies or omissions related to SCAs, interviews, and job application. The most \nworrisome is the 2006 production of falsified student academic transcripts, an incorrect \nand misleading resume, and falsified application (1.b). This admitted and obviously \npurposeful maneuver casts a pale on Applicant\u2019s efforts to promote himself in a \nfavorable light. However, I do find it conceivable that two of the allegations could be \nbased on semantics or simple misunderstanding (1.a and 1.c).  \n \nThe falsifications alleged at 1.d-1.f, however, seem to fall into the same category \nas the one at 1.b. Indeed, it seems as if Applicant is either truly unaware of how the \narguments here stack up, or simply prefers to rely on an argument more beneficial to his \ncause. While that is his choice, it fails to explain away the alternative facts offered or the \nsecurity concerns they raise. Taking these factors together, I find that Applicant \nmitigated financial considerations security concerns, but failed to mitigate personal \nconduct security concerns.  \n   \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline E:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.b:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.c:  \n \n \nFor Applicant  \nSubparagraphs 1.d-f: \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline F:  \n \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraph 2.a-2.c: \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n     Conclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant a security clearance. \nEligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n \n                                             \n \n \n \n \n____________________________ \nArthur E.

Applicant had two delinquent \nstudent loans, a garnishment, and 26 other delinquent obligations, which totaled in excess \nof $83,000 in delinquent financial obligations. Her student loan debt was paid through \ngarnishment. After the garnishment of her wages stopped, she has documented she \nmade three payments on her daughter\u2019s tuition of approximately $3,300 and an additional \nfive payments totaling approximately $300. Applicant did not make sufficient documented \nprogress toward resolving the debts alleged in the SOR. Financial considerations security \nconcerns are not mitigated. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n1 Applicant\u2019s last name has been legally changed since the SOR was issued. Her new last name is reflected \nin the caption.  \n12/21/2018\n\n \n2 \n \nStatement of the Case \n \n \nActing under the relevant Executive Order and DoD Directive,2 on April 14, 2017, \nthe DoD issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing financial considerations security \nconcerns. On May 1, 2017, Applicant answered the SOR and requested a hearing before \nan administrative judge. On February 8, 2018, DOHA issued a Notice of Hearing \nscheduling a hearing that was conducted on March 1, 2018. \n \n \nAt the hearing, Department Counsel offered Government Exhibits (Ex.) 1 through \n4, which were admitted into evidence without objection. Applicant offered exhibits A \nthrough F, which were also admitted without objection. In February 2018 and August \n2018, she submitted additional documents, which were admitted as Ex. G through Ex. N. \nApplicant and her husband testified at the hearing. DOHA received the hearing transcript \n(Tr.) on March 9, 2018. \n \nWhile this case was pending a decision, the Director of National Intelligence issued \nSecurity Executive Agent Directive 4, establishing the National Security Adjudicative \nGuidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information or Eligibility to \nHold a Sensitive Position (AGs), which he made applicable to all covered individuals who \nrequire initial or continued eligibility for access to classified information or eligibility to hold \na sensitive position. The new AGs supersede the Sept. 1, 2006 AGs and are effective \u201cfor \nall covered individuals\u201d on or after June 8, 2017.

The new AGs are available at http://ogc.osd.mil/doha/5220-6 R20170608.pdf. \n  \n\n \n3 \nworking for the defense contractor has been outstanding. Between August 2004 and June \n2017, she received numerous awards at work, which totaled in excess of $4,000. (Ex. E, \nEx M) Since 2003, her work performance has met or exceeded her employer\u2019s \nexpectations. For the last five years, her performance has been rated as exceeded or \nsignificantly exceeded. (Ex. L) In 2018, Applicant received an award in recognition of her \naccomplishments in science, technology, engineering and mathematics community. (Ex. \nN) She received the outstanding achievement award as a technology raising star. (Ex. N) \n \nIn January 2015, Applicant married. Her husband\u2019s annual salary is approximately \n$45,000 and he has worked for a government contractor since 2007. (Tr. 60, 64) He has \nadditional jobs: one as a referee, a second as a DJ, and does production work. (Tr. 62, \n64) The net monthly household take-home income is approximately $5,000. (Tr. 55) In \nMay 2000, Applicant received her Bachelor of Science degree in electrical engineering. \nIn August 2005, she received her Master of Science degree in system engineering. She \nmarried in January 2015 and has a 19-year-old, who is a college student, a 7 year old, \nand a 10-year-old stepson. (Tr. 21) Her stepson lives with his mother. \n \nOn Applicant\u2019s February 2013 Electronic Questionnaires for Investigations \nProcessing (e-QIP) she listed a single medical debt of $919. (Ex. 1) She stated she was \nworking with the creditor and would be setting up a monthly payment to resolve the debt. \nHer February 2018 credit report listed six delinquent obligations: SOR 1.b ($11,724), SOR \n1.c ($11,436), SOR 1.d ($8,245), SOR 1.f ($972), SOR 1.g ($297), and SOR 1.j ($497). \nThese six obligations total $33,171. She asserted she had a debt payoff plan to address \n24 delinquent obligations listed. The payoff plan would address $40,230 in debt.  \n \nThe payoff plan was scheduled to start in June 2018, three months following the \nhearing, and anticipated to end in May 2019.The payoff plan estimated she which would \npay off the debt in SOR 1.j ($497) in September 2018, the debt in SOR 1.g ($528) in \nNovember 2018, and the debts in SOR 1.b ($12,377), 1.c ($11,437), and 1.d ($8,245) \nwould be paid in May 2019. (Ex. K) The plan also includes paying off 12 medical debts \nand seven other debts in additional to the five debts previously listed. (Ex. K) Applicant \ndid not provide any documentation showing that payments had been made in accord with \nthe plan.  \n \n \nApplicant experienced financial difficulties while a single mother raising her \ndaughter. She was not receiving financial assistance from her daughter\u2019s father. (Tr. 17, \n23) At that time, her student loans (SOR 1.a, $43,000 and SOR 1.bb).had been in \ndeferment status since 2010. (Tr. 24) She had paid $200 monthly on her student loans \nuntil they went into deferment status. (Tr. 25) When her deferment ended she expected \nto receive a letter from the company from which she obtained her student loans. (Tr. 25) \nShe did not know the loans had been transferred to another company for collection. (Tr. \n17) She received letters from the company then holding the student loan notes, but did \nnot respond to the letters wrongfully assuming the letters were letters of solicitation from \na company wishing to consolidate her student loan with that company. (SOR Response) \nShe did not believe the collection letters came from a company that held her student \nloans. \n\n \n4 \nIn June 2014, Applicant\u2019s wages were garnished to collect the funds she owed on \nher student loans. She was unaware of the transfer until her wages were involuntarily \ngarnished in the amount of $1,200 monthly. This amount was more than her monthly \nmortgage payments. She was unsuccessful in attempting to have the amount of the \nweekly garnishment lowered. The garnishment was 15 percent of her wages. (Tr. 27) \nWhile the garnishment was in place, she was unable to address any of her other debt. \n(Tr. 17)  \n \nIn December 2017, the last amount owed on Applicant student loans was \ngarnished from her wages. (Ex. J) Her student loan debt of $43,000 was then completely \npaid by the garnishment. (Tr. 28) Her February 2018 credit report lists a zero balance on \nher state guaranteed student loans and her educational financial accounts. (Ex.4) Her \nOctober 2015 credit report listed $38,237 in student loans. (Ex. 2) While her wages were \nbeing garnished, she was unable to address many of her financial obligations. \n \nApplicant had a $12,377 vehicle purchase account (SOR 1.b) charged off. In April \n2016, a hailstorm \u201ctotaled\u201d the vehicle. (Tr. 32) Her insurance coverage paid $5,000 on \nthe vehicle. She did not have gap insurance resulting in the $12,377 debt. (Tr. 33) She \nwas unable to address this debt while the garnishment was in place. Now that the \ngarnishment has ended, she has $1,200 monthly to address her other delinquent \naccounts. (Tr. 50) She asserts she intends to start addressing her delinquent debts. She \nprovided the payoff plan with payments to start in June 2018.  \n \n \nApplicant incurred an $11,4374 collection account (SOR 1.c). She is current on \nanother loan with the same creditor that has a loan balance of approximately $4,000. \nOnce that loan is paid, she asserted she will commence paying this debt. (Tr. 34) She \nhad a line of credit that resulted in the bank charging off $8,245 (SOR 1.d). She also had \na $972 credit card account (SOR 1.f) that was also charged off. (Tr. 37) In her SOR \nResponse, she indicated a repayment plan had been established to pay the debt. She \nalso stated in her SOR Response that \u201cpayment mitigation plans\u201d had been set up with \nthe creditors in: SOR 1.h, SOR 1.i, SOR 1, j, SOR 1.k, SOR 1.m. SOR 1.n, SOR 1.o, SOR \n1.t, SOR 1.u, SOR 1.v, SOR 1.w, SOR 1.y, SOR 1.z, and SOR 1.aa. The accounts went \ndelinquent in 2009 or 2010, before the garnishment started. (Tr. 37) The accounts when \ndelinquent at the time her daughter\u2019s father stopped providing child support.  \n \n \nIn Applicant\u2019s May 2017 SOR Response, she stated the debts in SOR 1.q ($60), \nSOR 1.r ($35), and SOR 1.s ($35) had been paid, but provided no documentation showing \npayment had been made. (SOR Response) In her response, she indicated the following \ndelinquent obligations would be paid by December 2017: SOR 1.w ($356), SOR 1.y \n($227), SOR 1.z ($194), and SOR 1.aa ($125). (SOR Response) No documentation was \nreceived showing payment had been made on these debts. These four medical debts \nappear in her payoff plan showing she intended to pay the debts in June 2018, July 2018, \nand August 2018. (Ex. J) \n \n                                                          \n4 The collection account in SOR 1.c was listed as \u201c$11,4377.\u201d Department Counsel moved to amend the \namount to $11,437. (Tr. 8) There being no objection, the amount was changed. \n\n \n5 \n \nIn May 2017, when Applicant responded to the SOR, she stated she was unfamiliar \nwith the $479 past-due account (SOR 1.e). (Tr. 37) She had a $528 credit card account \n(SOR 1.g) charged off. The credit card was used to purchase school clothes for her \ndaughter in 2014. (Tr. 39) Her February 2018 credit report indicates a balance of $297 \nshowing she has made some payments on the debt. (Ex. 4) She had a $507 collection \naccount (SOR 1.h) for a home improvement store. (Tr. 40) It is part of a repayment plan \nshe intends to start. (Tr. 41) She plans on starting to pay her smaller debts and allow the \n\u201csnowball effect\u201d to help her address her delinquent accounts. (Tr. 41) \n \n \nApplicant owed approximately $2,200 on 12 delinquent medical debts: SOR 1.i \n($499), SOR 1.l ($379), SOR 1.n ($149), 1.o ($144), SOR 1.p ($60), SOR 1.q ($60), SOR \n1.r ($35), SOR 1.s ($1), SOR 1.w ($356), SOR 1.y ($277), SOR 1.z ($194), and SOR \n1.aa ($125). She had health insurance and assumed her insurance company would have \npaid these medical debts for surgery received. (Tr. 42) She asserted that in April 2017, \nshe made a repayment plan with one of the creditors and made a payment on the plan. \n(Tr. 41) She has not made any additional payments. She was unfamiliar with these \nmedical debts. She was the victim of identity theft and wanted to make sure the debts \nwere valid. (Tr. 44) She believes she has paid some of these medical debts. (Tr. 46) \n \n \nApplicant learned that her identity had been stolen when she attempted to file her \ntaxes one year and was told her tax return had already been filed. (Tr. 51) It took nine \nmonths to resolve the problem. She has been on a fraud alert with one of the major credit \nreporting agencies. (Tr. 52) When credit inquiries are made, she receives notification of \nthe inquiry. She provided no additional information has to how the identity theft has \naffected her finances. In her SOR Response she denied two of the SOR debts and \nadmitted, sometimes with explanation, the other 26 SOR delinquent obligations.  \n \nApplicant owed a $497 collection balance on a department store account (SOR \n1.j). (Tr. 41) She owed $405 on another credit card collection account (SOR 1.k) in \ncollection. She owed $697 on a telephone company collection account (SOR 1.u) and \n$647 on an electrical bill collection debt (SOR 1.v). (Tr. 47) She has included these four \ndebts in her repayment plan. (Tr. 42) She disputes a debt with the bottled water company \n(SOR 1.m, $167). (Tr. 43) In December 2017, she asserts the cable television collection \naccount (SOR 1.t, $1,222) was paid. (Tr. 47) She disputes a $342 insurance collection \ndebt (SOR 1.x, $342) since she never had insurance with the company. (Tr. 48)  \n \nAt some period of time not set forth in the record, Applicant sought the services of \na credit correction company who sent letters on her behalf disputing each of the SOR \ndebts. (Tr. 49) She employed the credit correction company to assist her in having \ndelinquent accounts removed from her credit report. She had 34 negative accounts \nremoved5 from her credit report. (Ex. F) There is no indication she made any payment on \nthe negative accounts. Her credit score was 602 indicating her credit was \u201cfair.\u201d (Ex. F) \n                                                          \n5 The removal of debts supposedly includes the debt in SOR 1.c ($11,436). The credit collection company\u2019s \ninformation indicates this debt was to be removed in August 2017 and October 2017. However, the debt \nstill appears on her February 2018 credit report and appears as a debt to be paid in her payoff plan. (Ex. F, \nEx. J, and Ex. 4) \n\n \n6 \nNor did she indicate which, if any, of the removed accounts were listed as SOR delinquent \nobligations. The document from the credit collection company indicates that should she,  \n \nfail to pay a credit or charge card bill, bounce a check, or miss payments on \nother credit related bills, the issuer may continue in house collection efforts \nor send you overdue bill to a third pay collection agency, a company that \nwill then attempt to obtain payment from you. (Ex. F) \n \nApplicant now monitors her finances to the penny. (Tr. 53) She has approximately \n$128,000 in her 401(k) retirement plan. (Tr. 54) Her husband has approximately $20,000 \nin his 401(k) retirement plan. (Tr. 65) She pays $1,100 monthly on her mortgage for the \nhouse she has lived in since 2003. (Tr. 55) She is current on her monthly car payment \n($500) and truck payment ($700). (Tr. 56) Both vehicle were purchased used. \n \nApplicant\u2019s husband believes they are getting back on track and believes the future \nis \u201ca whole lot brighter.\u201d (Tr. 63) They had a plan to address their debts which was \ninterrupted by the garnishment. (Tr. 63) They have read books on financial planning, \ntalked with their pastor, and listened to the Dave Ramsey radio show about implementing \nthe financial planning techniques set forth in the Financial Peace University. (Tr. 63) They \nnow take time to evaluate their situation before making a financial decision. (Tr. 64) In \nAugust 2017, her mother died and she paid expenses from her death. (Ex. G) \n \nApplicant testified at her hearing that her approach to her finances has changed, \nas follows: \n \nWe have been, you know, kind of lackadaisical in our approach to paying \noff previous debts, but now that we are fully aware that it affects my job, that \nwe have been aggressively trying to get these [her delinquent debts] to zero. \n(Tr. 73)  \n \nApplicant made five payments, which totaled approximately $6,500, for her \ndaughter\u2019s tuition. (Ex. H) Three of the payments, which totaled $3,166, occurred after \nthe hearing. In addition to paying her daughter\u2019s tuition, she provided documentation that \nshe made five payments to creditors that totaled $180. (Ex. I) In May and June 2018, she \nmade two payments of $25.37 each to the creditor of the SOR 1.h debt ($507). (Ex. I) In \nMay 2018, she made a $19.82 payment to a creditor. In May and June 2018, she made \ntwo payments of $55 each to a creditor, but failed to indicate to which SOR debt it applied. \n(Ex. I) She stopped making payments to these three creditors when she found out her \ndaughter\u2019s tuition would not be fully funded. (Ex. G) \n \nCharacter Statements \n \n \nA co-worker, who has known Applicant for five years and has been Applicant\u2019s \ndirect manager for the past three years, states Applicant is dedicated, trustworthy, and \ndetail-oriented, and takes great pride in her work. (Ex. A) Applicant is willing to put forth \nextra effort or long hours if required by the job. A co-worker, who has known Applicant for \n\n \n7 \nmore than ten years, states Applicant is very diligent. (Ex. B) A manager, who has known \nApplicant for more than five years, states Applicant continuously demonstrates high \nethical character in executing her responsibilities. (Ex. C) A friend, who has known \nApplicant for more than 21 years, states Applicant is dependable, professional, always \nwilling to go the extra mile to accomplish goals, morally upstanding, trustworthy, has an \nexcellent work ethic, and who donates her time to the youth department at her church. \n(Ex. D) \n \n Policies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which must be considered in evaluating \nan applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), \nthe adjudication process is an examination of a sufficient period and a careful weight of a \nnumber of variables of an individual\u2019s life to make an affirmative determination that the \nindividual is an acceptable security risk. This is known as the whole-person concept.  \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record.  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation of potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n  \n\n \n8 \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination of the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \n \nAdjudicative Guideline (AG) \u00b6 18 articulates the security concerns relating to \nfinancial problems: \n \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information . . . An individual who is financially \noverextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal acts or other \nquestionable acts to generate funds. \n \nAdditionally, an individual who is financially irresponsible may also be \nirresponsible, unconcerned, negligent, or careless in properly handling and safeguarding \nclassified information. Behaving responsibly or irresponsibly in one aspect of life provides \nan indication of how a person may behave in other aspects of life. \n \nA person\u2019s relationship with her creditors is a private matter until evidence is \nuncovered demonstrating an inability or unwillingness to repay debts under agreed upon \nterms. Absent evidence of strong extenuating or mitigating circumstances, an applicant \nwith a history of serious or recurring financial difficulties is in a position of risk that is \ninconsistent with holding a security clearance. Applicant is not required to be debt free, \nbut is required to manage her finances to meet her financial obligations. \n \nAG \u00b6 19 includes two disqualifying conditions that could raise a security concern \nand may be disqualifying in this case: \u201c(a) inability to satisfy debts;\u201d and \u201c(c) a history of \nnot meeting financial obligations.\u201d Security concerns are established under AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) \nand 19(c) because Applicant had delinquent student loans of approximately $43,000, \nwhich have now been paid by an involuntary garnishment action. Additionally, Applicant \nhad 25 delinquent accounts, which totaled in excess of $40,000. The burden shifted to \nApplicant to produce evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the security \nconcerns. (Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15) \n \n \nThe Appeal Board explained the scope and rationale for the financial \nconsiderations security concern in ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012) \n(citation omitted) as follows: \n \n\n \n9 \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an applicant might \nknowingly compromise classified information in order to raise money in \nsatisfaction of his or her debts. Rather, it requires a Judge to examine the \ntotality of an applicant\u2019s financial history and circumstances. The Judge \nmust consider pertinent evidence regarding the applicant\u2019s self-control, \njudgment, and other qualities essential to protecting the national secrets as \nwell as the vulnerabilities inherent in the circumstances. The Directive \npresumes a nexus between proven conduct under any of the Guidelines \nand an applicant\u2019s security eligibility. \n \nApplicant has the burden of establishing that matters in mitigation apply. One or \nmore of the following conditions under AG \u00b6 20 may apply: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem from \na legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit counseling \nservice, and there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved \nor is under control; \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue. \n \nApplicant presented some mitigating information. She experienced financial \ndifficulties when, as a single mother raising her daughter, she did not receive financial \nassistance from her daughter\u2019s father. Her mother died in August 2017, and she had to \npay some of the expenses related to her mother\u2019s death. These are factors beyond her \ncontrol. The involuntary garnishment for her student loans prevented her from addressing \nher other financial obligations. However, the garnishment ended in December 2017, she \npresented documentation of only five payments, which totaled $3,346. Three payments \nof $3,166 were made on her daughter\u2019s tuition and $180 in five payments went to SOR \ndebts. She stopped making payments to these creditors when she found out her \ndaughter\u2019s tuition would not be fully funded. \n\n \n10 \nApplicant has worked for her employer for more than 17 years and her duty \nperformance has been outstanding. Her annual salary is approximately $124,000 and her \nhusband\u2019s annual salary is approximately $45,000. With a household income of \n$169,000, she has documented payment of only $180 on the SOR delinquent obligations.  \nShe has presented a debt payoff plan, but has failed to document payment in accord with \nthat plan. Intentions to pay debts in the future are not a substitute for a track record of \ndebt repayment or other responsible approaches. See ISCR Case No. 11-14570 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Oct 23, 2013) She has not acted responsibly to address her delinquent SOR \ndebts after the involuntary garnishment ended in December 2017. \n \nApplicant admitted she and her husband had been lackadaisical in their approach \nto paying off her debts, but now were fully aware that her job is affected by her delinquent \nobligations. She asserts she now monitors her finances to the penny, has approximately \n$128,000 in her 401(k) retirement plan, and her husband has approximately $20,000 in \nhis 401(k) retirement plan. They are current on their mortgaged and vehicle payments. \nShe asserts she has been aggressively trying to get these her delinquent debts to zero, \nbut documented payments of less than $200 fails to support this assertion.  \n \nSome of Applicant\u2019s delinquencies have been removed from her credit report. The \ndebts were not removed because they were paid. The Appeal Board has observed \u201cthat \n[the fact] some debts have dropped off [an individual\u2019s] credit report is not meaningful \nevidence of debt resolution.\u201d ISCR Case No. 14-05803 at 3 (App. Bd. July 7, 2016) (citing \nISCR Case No. 14-03612 at 3 (App. Bd. Aug. 25, 2015)). Additionally, Applicant failed to \ndocument that any of the removed debts correlated to the delinquent SOR obligations. \nShe admitted to incurring all but two of the SOR debts, and she listed 24 of the SOR debts \nto be paid in the future under her payoff plan. \n \nThe mitigating factors in AG \u00b6 20(a) do not apply because the debts are numerous \nand remain unpaid. AG \u00b6 20(b) does not apply even though there are some factors that \nwere beyond her control such as her mother death in 2017, her failure to receive child \nsupport, the involuntary bankruptcy, and her assertion of identity theft.6 The small amount \nof documented payments shows she has not acted responsibly under the circumstances.  \n \nApplicant has read books on financial planning, talked with her pastor, and listened \nto financial planning radio shows. However, for AG \u00b6 20(c) to apply there must not only \nbe financial counseling, but clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under \ncontrol, which has not been documented.  \n \n \nIn Applicant\u2019s May 2017 SOR Response, she indicated she had established certain \nrepayment plans. At the time of hearing, nine months later, no payments had been made \nor evidence provided that repayment plans existed. Following the hearing, she presented \nevidence of a debt payoff plan but no track record of payments in accord with that plan \nfrom which I could reasonably conclude that she can be counted on to make timely \n                                                          \n6 Applicant asserts she learned of identity theft when she filed her income tax returns. However, she did \nnot show how that identity theft impacted on the delinquent SOR obligations. The majority of those \nobligations she admitted to in her SOR response and are part of her payoff plan. \n\n \n11 \npayments to resolve her substantial delinquencies. Involuntary garnishment resolved her \nstudent loans in SOR 1.a, but it is not considered a good-faith effort under AG \u00b6 20(d), \nwhich does not apply. AG \u00b6 20(e) does not apply because Applicant has denied only two \nof the debts, which totaled approximately $800 of the $40,000 of delinquent debt. She \nhas not provided a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the past-due debt which \nis the cause of the problem. Nor has she provided documented proof to substantiate the \nbasis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions to resolve the issue.  \n \nAn Applicant is not required to be debt-free or to develop a plan for paying off all \ndebts immediately or simultaneously, but she is required to act responsibly given her \ncircumstances and develop a reasonable plan to address her delinquent obligations, \naccompanied by evidence of a serious intent to effectuate the plan. This has not been \ndone. \n \nWhole-Person Analysis  \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept. An administrative judge must evaluate \nan Applicant\u2019s security eligibility by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s conduct and \nall the relevant circumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.  \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline F in the whole-person analysis. In her favor, her duty performance has been \noutstanding. A number supervisors, co-workers, and friends presented favorable \ncomments on Applicant\u2019s work performance and character. Additionally, she has received \na prestigious award in recognition of her accomplishments in science, technology, \nengineering and the mathematics community. The outstanding achievement award \nrecognized her as a technology raising star. \n \n\n \n12 \nThe financial evidence against approval of Applicant\u2019s clearance is more \nsubstantial at this time. Applicant has a history of financial problems. Applicant listed a \nsingle medical delinquent account on her e-QIP. There is no showing she has been in \ncontact with her creditors. She has a household income of $169,000, been gainfully \nemployed for more than 17 years with the same employer, but has documented payment \nof less than $200 on her delinquent obligations since the involuntary garnishment ended \nin December 2017. She has not shown that she acted responsibly to address her \ndelinquent debts. Applicant\u2019s failure to make greater progress resolving her SOR debts \nshows lack of financial responsibility and judgment and raises unmitigated questions \nabout her reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified information. See AG \n\u00b6 18. The issue is not simply whether all Applicant\u2019s debts are paid\u2014it is whether her \nfinancial circumstances raise concerns about her fitness to hold a security clearance. See \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 2(a) and 2(b). \n \nIt is well settled that once a concern arises regarding an Applicant\u2019s security \nclearance eligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or renewal of a \nsecurity clearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th Cir. 1990). After \nweighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions and evaluating all the evidence in the \ncontext of the whole person, the unmitigated financial considerations security concerns \nlead me to conclude that grant of a security clearance to Applicant is not warranted at this \ntime. This decision should not be construed as a determination that Applicant cannot or \nwill not attain the state of reform necessary for award of a security clearance in the future. \nWith a track record of behavior consistent with her obligations, she may well be able to \ndemonstrate persuasive evidence of her security clearance worthiness.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFinancial Considerations Security Concern:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:   \n  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.b through 1.s:   \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nSubparagraph 1.t:   \n  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.u through 1.s:   \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n  \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for \naccess to classified information.

Bakaj, Esquire \n \n08/28/2019 \n______________ \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \n \nMARSHALL, Jr., Arthur E., Administrative Judge: \n \n                                        Statement of the Case \n \nOn April 30, 2018, the Department of Defense (DOD) issued Applicant a \nStatement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security concerns under Guideline J (Criminal \nConduct) and Guideline E (Personal Conduct). The action was taken under Executive \nOrder 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), \nas amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance \nReview Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative \nguidelines (AG) effective within the DOD on or after June 8, 2017. On May 21, 2018, \nApplicant timely submitted a response in which he admitted all allegations and \nrequested a hearing before an administrative judge from the Defense Office of Hearings \nand Appeals (DOHA). I was assigned the case on October 12, 2018. DOHA issued a \nnotice of hearing on December 12, 2018, setting the hearing for January 17, 2019. The \nhearing was convened as scheduled.  \n \nThe Government offered eight documents, accepted without objection as exhibits \n(Exs.) 1-8. Applicant offered testimony, introduced one witness, and 23 documents, \nwhich were accepted without objection as Exs. A-W. He was given through January 25, \n2019, to submit additional documents. On that date, one additional reference was \naccepted without objection as Ex. X. Applicant was granted additional time to submit \n\n \n \n \n \n2 \nadditional material through March 1, 2019. The transcript (Tr.) was received on January \n28, 2019.  With no additional material received by March 1, 2019, the record was \nclosed. Based on the exhibits, testimony, and record as a whole, I find Applicant \nmitigated all security concerns.   \n \n     Findings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant is a 53-year-old systems engineer who has served in the same position \nfor the past 15 years. He has maintained a security clearance without incident since \n2006. He excels at work. (Ex. J) Applicant has completed high school and attended \nsome college. He is the divorced father of two grown children. The marriage was \ncontentious and Applicant filed for divorce in 1995 based on her flagrant infidelity. In his \nspare time, he has volunteered with an organization devoted to women\u2019s health issues. \n \n \nIn September 1983, when he was 18 years old, Applicant was stopped for \nspeeding as he enjoyed an end of summer meeting with a high school friend. Applicant \nhad been drinking alcohol and also had used Listerine to freshen his breath. He was \narrested after being administered a breathalyzer test (.01). He was charged with driving \nunder the influence (DUI). He was not convicted of DUI, but was given probation before \njudgment. Applicant completed prescribed classes, as ordered.  \n \nIn 1991, Applicant was charged with battery following a scuffle at a party where \nhis former wife felt he was flirting with other women. She sprayed Mace (pepper spray) \nin his face, he lunged, and knocked her over. As he tried to wash the substance from \nhis face, she called the police. The matter was put on the stet docket for a year, during \nwhich time no additional incidents occurred and the case was abandoned. Around this \ntime, he learned his former spouse was pregnant, and their relationship improved. (Tr. \n49) \n \nDespite getting married in 1993, their relationship had started to decline by \nAugust 1994 after Applicant discovered his wife was seeing other men. The clues to this \nface were not subtle. (Tr. 49-50) A heated argument was verbally waged, and Applicant \nwent to spend the night at his parents\u2019 vacant home. The next morning, police arrested \nhim and he was charged with one count of abuse (child under 18), two counts of \nassault, and two counts of battery. Applicant continues to maintain no physical \ninteraction occurred with either his now former spouse or a child. (Tr. 50-51) Indeed, he \nstressed that the children were away with his parents. On advice of counsel, and so as \nnot to protract either the process or the marriage, Applicant accepted a plea deal and \npled guilty to the battery charges. (see, e.g., Tr. 51, 83) He then attended anger \nmanagement class, was sentenced to four years suspended confinement, and \nseparated from his spouse. \n \nIn 1995, Applicant and his estranged spouse tried to reconcile for the benefit of \nthe children despite his spouse\u2019s continued infidelities. (Tr. 52) Their reunion did not \nhamper her evening activities outside of the home. In February 1996, the spouse came \nhome as Applicant was resting. The spouse went to her room and later emerged to call \n\n \n \n \n \n3 \nthe police, claiming he had \u201csmashed [her] headboard and ruined some furniture.\u201d (Tr. \n53) She had a temporary protective order instituted, which forced Applicant to vacate \nthe home, and a domestic violence suit was brought against him. He appealed that \ndetermination and the matter was subsumed into the on-going divorce and custody \ncase. (Tr. 86) With her trying to harass him through legal process multiple times, \nApplicant hired a private investigator to \u201cvalidate the fact that this is her motivation - to \nreplace me, again . . . and move her boyfriend in. . . .\u201d (Tr. 55, 85-86) Among the \ninvestigator\u2019s findings were the spouse\u2019s misuse of credit cards, leaving their two \nchildren unsupervised, and other incidents she could blame on him. (Tr. 55; Ex. K, Q-T)  \n \nIn April 1996, Applicant and his estranged spouse had to talk about the children, \nbills, and the household. The spouse was unhappy taking on her share of \nresponsibilities and threatened to file a harassment charge against him. (Tr. 55) For six \nmonths, he was unable to visit the children after he was charged with three counts of \nviolating an ex parte protective order and one count of harassment. The harassment \ncharges were dismissed. (Tr. 56) Around this same time, the spouse went to court to \naddress the misuse of credit card and leaving a child unattended issues. (Tr. 56)  \n \n \nOne night in May 1996, under much marital stress, Applicant had a beer or two \nwith a friend. (Tr. 80-81) He later stopped at a diner for something to eat and had one \ndrink. (Tr. 80) When he left, he was pulled over by a policeman who claimed that there \nhad been a call reporting an intoxicated driver. No field sobriety test or breathalyzer was \nadministered, but he admitted to having had alcohol. (Tr. 80) He was arrested and \ncharged with DUI. As a result, he was ordered to one-year unsupervised probation. \nFrom this experience, he has learned to never take control of a vehicle after he has had \nany alcohol to drink, a rule he maintains today. (Tr. 58) Currently, Applicant only drinks \na \u201climited\u201d amount of beer at dinner or on a special occasion. (Tr. 81) He will use Uber if \nhe has had any alcohol. \n \n \nIn 1997, after Applicant and his wife divorced on his petition. Applicant was \nawarded custody of the two children. They were aged about four and six, respectively. \nOne weekend in June 2001, Applicant took the children to the home of a family friend \nfor a birthday party. (Tr. 59) Applicant\u2019s ex-wife and her most current boyfriend showed \nup at the event uninvited. (Tr. 59-60) Although it was not one of her weekends for child \nvisitation, she wanted to take the children to make up for times she had failed to adhere \nto the established weekend custody time schedule.  \n \nApplicant was put into a \u201cprecarious\u201d position by his ex-wife during a children\u2019s \nparty. (Tr. 60) Her boyfriend got involved and started arguing with Applicant to the point \nwhere he \u201cgot in [Applicant\u2019s] face and pushed [him] to the ground.\u201d (Tr. 60)  While \nApplicant was on the floor, his ex-wife and her boyfriend took off in a vehicle with the \nchildren. That Monday, Applicant received a summons stating he had struck his ex-\nwife\u2019s boyfriend, despite several witnesses later appearing in court testifying that it was \nApplicant who was struck. (Tr. 61) Despite their testimony, and despite the boyfriend \ntestifying the ex-wife had started the incident, the judge decided Applicant was guilty of \nsecond-degree assault. The ex-wife requested a restraining order from the court, but \n\n \n \n \n \n4 \nher request was denied as there was no evidence any party was in harm. (Tr. 62) She \nthen decided to again request custody of the children. (Tr. 62-63) \n \nIn 2006, Applicant\u2019s daughter was about 13 or 14 and experiencing some \nbehavioral issues. Applicant was still acting as both father and mother for the child. The \ndaughter would complain to her mother that Applicant was too strict. Applicant\u2019s mother \nagain tried to get a restraining order against Applicant in attempt to gain custody of both \nthe children and take them with her to another state. Her two requests were denied by \nthe court and Applicant continued maintaining custody of the children, with his ex-wife \nonly permitted visitation. (Tr. 64-65)   \n \nIn around 2008, Applicant began dating a woman he met through his \nvolunteering. They enjoyed each other\u2019s company and, after about a year, they moved \nin together. At the time, the girlfriend had two daughters, aged 4 and 6. Applicant moved \nthe four to a better community with superior schools and a safer area. The four got \nalong well and \u201chad a great time.\u201d (Tr. 40)  \n \nIn May 2010, Applicant discovered that his teenage son was getting into the drug \nscene. Applicant\u2019s girlfriend and her daughters were living with Applicant at the time, \nand they were aware of the son\u2019s various forms of misbehavior, leading Applicant to \npronounce that smoking was not permitted in the home. (Tr. 65) The son complained to \nhis mother, Applicant\u2019s ex-wife. This led her to again pursue a temporary restraining \norder, this time alleging child abuse, against Applicant. Ultimately, a restraining order \nwas denied. (Tr. 66) This was Applicant\u2019s last conflict with his ex-wife. His children, now \nages 24 and 26, live separate lives apart from their mother. Although the son still has \nissues with drugs about which Applicant has struggled, the child\u2019s mother maintains little \ncontact with the man. (Tr. 66) \n \nIn June 2015, Applicant was leading a household comprised of his girlfriend, her \ntwo daughters, the eldest daughter\u2019s baby, and Applicant. He was acting as both parent \nand grandparent, managing the children\u2019s schedules, cooking meals, and providing \ncounsel. (Tr. 13) At this time, the younger of Applicant\u2019s girlfriend\u2019s minor daughters was \ntrying to date a man in his 20s.  \n \nWhen Applicant discovered the man with his girlfriend\u2019s daughter in the home \none school night around 9:00 or 10:00 p.m., Applicant reminded the child of her curfew \nand asked the man to leave. The decision was made in tandem with the girl\u2019s mother. \n(Tr. 16) The girl got very upset and started a heated argument, yelling and screaming. \n(Tr. 16) The potential date demonstrated his \u201chot temper\u201d joined the girl in yelling and \nshoved Applicant. (Tr. 17, 68-69) He then lunged at Applicant as he tried to phone the \npolice. The girl\u2019s sister tried to stop the younger man and got between the two males, \ngetting accidently elbowed in the face in the process. Applicant tried to retreat to the \nbathroom to call the police, but the younger man pursued and got Applicant in a \nheadlock. (Tr. 17) \n \n\n \n \n \n \n5 \nA melee ensued. The mother entered the room and became upset after seeing \none daughter had received a bloody nose from being elbowed. (Tr. 22) The mother \nnever saw the scuffle. After statements were taken, Applicant was arrested and charged \nwith second degree assault of the females. (Tr. 70) This was due in part to the mother\u2019s \nstatement that she thought Applicant had hit the girl and the younger daughter\u2019s \nstatement that he struck her mother. (Tr. 18-19, 70-71) In court, the girl recanted her \nstatement that Applicant had struck her mother in the skirmish and the man pled the 5th \nAmendment. (Tr. 70-71) Applicant was found not guilty of assault against the teen.  \n \nDespite the youngest daughter\u2019s recantation, Applicant was found guilty of \nassaulting his girlfriend. Applicant appealed the matter, discrepancies in the witnesses \ntestimonies were stressed, and the case was ultimately dropped. (Tr. 71, 91-92)  \n \nThus began an end of the romantic relationship between Applicant and his \ngirlfriend, but time has healed any wounds and all parties have moved on. (Tr. 94) \nToday, Applicant is close to his ex-girlfriend\u2019s daughters and grandchild. The former \ngirlfriend and the elder daughter now live in different states, but both wrote \nrecommendations for Applicant. (Exs. B-C) Applicant and the two daughters text, visit \nwhen in the same town, and otherwise maintain varying degrees of contact. Applicant \nhas provided nominal financial assistance to the younger women when needed, but \nnone of the women is financially dependent on him.  \n \nThe girlfriend\u2019s younger daughter has matured since 2015. She flew in to appear \nat the hearing and testified on Applicant\u2019s behalf at the hearing, noting that she loves \nand completely trusts him as a father figure and as a man, around whom she has never \nfelt unsafe or at risk. (Tr. 12-21, 26) The two speak by telephone about every other day. \n(Tr. 26) The daughters\u2019 natural father is appreciative of Applicant\u2019s help with the young \nwomen. (Tr. 72-73; Ex. G)  \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. They are applied in conjunction \nwith the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto the AG, the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known \nas the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. The AG \nrequires that any doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to classified \n\n \n \n \n \n6 \ninformation will be resolved in favor of national security. In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record.  \n \nUnder the Directive, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. In addition, an applicant is responsible for \npresenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts \nadmitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel and has the ultimate burden of \npersuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours. The Government reposes a high degree of \ntrust and confidence in those granted access to classified information. Decisions \ninclude, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the applicant may deliberately or \ninadvertently fail to safeguard such information. Decisions shall be in terms of the \nnational interest and do not question the loyalty of an applicant.  \n \nAnalysis \nGuideline J \u2013 Criminal Conduct \n \n \nThe concern raised by criminal conduct is set out in AG \u00b6 30:  \n \nCriminal activity creates doubt about a person's judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person's ability \nor willingness to comply with laws, rules and regulations. \n \nApplicant\u2019s series of multiple arrests and charges are sufficient to establish the \nfollowing disqualifying conditions: \n \nAG \u00b6 31(a): a pattern of minor offenses, any one of which on its own \nwould be unlikely to affect a national security eligibility decision, but which \nin 6 combination cast doubt on the individual's judgment, reliability, or \ntrustworthiness; and  \n \nAG \u00b6 31(b): evidence (including, but not limited to, a credible allegation, \nan admission, and matters of official record) of criminal conduct, \nregardless of whether the individual was formally charged, prosecuted, or \nconvicted.  \n \nThe security concerns raised under this guideline may be mitigated by the following \napplicable factors: \n \nAG \u00b6 32(a): so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior \nhappened, or it happened under such unusual circumstances, that it is \n\n \n \n \n \n7 \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; and  \n \nAG \u00b6 32 (d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including, but \nnot limited to, the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, \nrestitution, compliance with the terms of parole or probation, job training or \nhigher education, good employment record, or constructive community \ninvolvement.  \n \nApplicant abused alcohol and drove a vehicle twice, well over 20 years ago. \nSince that time, he has been mindful of his alcohol use, does not drink and drive, and \nhas become used to using Uber, if he needs it. Before, during, and after his contentious \nmarriage, Applicant was seemingly trapped in a situation where legal process was used \nby his ex-wife to gain some form of advantage over him, most often with regard to their \nchildren. Despite her using multiple restraining orders and various allegations as \nweapons, it was Applicant who almost invariably maintained physical custody over their \nchildren. It was also Applicant whose bond with those children has seemingly endured. \nIndeed, since the divorce and the children coming of age, she has apparently lost \ninterest in the family and moved on. Free of her and her machinations, Applicant\u2019s life \nhas been comparatively drama-free and crime-free, giving him time to concentrate on \nwork and on volunteering within his community.  \n \nOnly one subsequent incident of criminal conduct has occurred since Applicant\u2019s \nex-wife left the scene. In trying to enforce a curfew for his girlfriend\u2019s teenage daughter \nwhen a man came to call, Applicant found himself in the middle of a ruckus involving a \nhysterical teen, a surly \u201chot head\u201d suitor, a confused and dramatic mother, and the \nmother\u2019s elder daughter trying to calm tensions all around. Despite later statements to \nthe contrary, Applicant was ultimately found guilty of a second degree assault against \nthe mother, his now ex-girlfriend. Today, however that girlfriend and her two daughters \nspeak in favor of Applicant and recommend him for a security clearance. The hysterical \nteen is now a mature young lady who speaks highly of Applicant, who she now loves \nand respects as a father figure. Even the girl\u2019s natural father appreciates Applicant\u2019s \nefforts to help raise the girls. Despite the 2015 incident helping end his relationship with \nhis ex-girlfriend, there is no apparent rancor by any of the individuals, each enjoying \nvarying degrees of closeness and physical proximity with each other.  \n \nGiven where Applicant is today with regard to both his ex-wife, his ex-girlfriend, \nand their respective children, it is highly unlikely such family dramas will be repeated, \nparticularly given Applicant subsequent maturation and personal resolve. He has \nlearned anger management skills, excelled at work, and gained the genuine and \ncredibly expressed love and appreciation of a young lady he helped raise. He has \nmoved from the responsibilities of being a father figure to minors to being a grandfather \nfigure to their children. I find AG \u00b6 32(a) and AG \u00b6 32(d) apply. \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n8 \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct  \n \n \nThe security concern for personal conduct is set out in AG \u00b6 15: \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. Here, the SOR repeats in its entirety allegations raised under the \npreceding guideline, and also references one suit and multiple restraining orders issued \nagainst him by or at the request of his ex-wife. Such conduct could raise the following \ndisqualifying conditions:  \n \nAG \u00b6 16(d) credible adverse information that is not explicitly covered \nunder any other guideline and many not be sufficient by itself for an \nadverse determination, but which, when combined with all available \ninformation, supports a whole-person assessment of questionable \njudgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to \ncomply with rules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that \nthe individual may not properly safeguard classified or sensitive \ninformation. This includes, but is not limited to, considerations of: . . . (2) \nany disruptive, violent, or other inappropriate behavior; (3) a pattern of \ndishonesty or rule violations. . . ; and \n \nAG \u00b6 16(e) personal conduct, or concealment of information about one\u2019s \nconduct, that creates a vulnerability to exploitation, or duress by a foreign \nintelligence entity or other individual or group. Such conduct includes: (1) \nengaging in activities which, if known, could affect the person\u2019s persona, \nprofessional, or community standing.   \n \n \nThis guideline provides seven potential mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 17. Four \nare potentially applicable under these facts: \n \nAG \u00b6 17(c): the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the \nbehavior is so infrequent, or it happened under such unique \ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the \nindividual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \nAG \u00b6 17(d): the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained \ncounseling to change the behavior or taken other positive steps to \nalleviate the stressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to \nuntrustworthy, unreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such \nbehavior is unlikely to recur; \n \n\n \n \n \n \n9 \nAG \u00b6 17(e): the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate \nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress; and  \n \n AG \u00b6 17(g): association with persons involved in criminal activities was \nunwitting, has ceased, or occurs under circumstances that do not cast \ndoubt upon the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, judgment, or \nwillingness to comply with rules and regulations. \n \nAs a threshold issue, my findings under the preceding guideline are incorporated \nunder this guideline, thus substantially giving rise to AG \u00b6 17(c). In addition, the current \nguideline offers four allegations related to Applicant\u2019s ex-wife\u2019s use of legal process \nduring and after their marriage. Taken in isolation, each incident indicates that there \nmay be more than meets the eye. Taken as a pattern, however, the facts tend to \nsubstantiate Applicant\u2019s assertion that his ex-wife\u2019s attempt to harass or gain advantage \nover him was the motivating factor behind most of her claims and attempts to secure \nrestraining orders. I am also moved by the fact that he successfully maintained custody \nof their children throughout most of this period despite her multiple derogatory \nassertions.  \n \nMoreover, Applicant was candid in his testimony. His current recollections may \nnot match 100% with previously documented versions of facts. It is noted, however, that \nthe timeline at issue extends over a period in excess of 35 years, involves highly \npersonal incidents one may not choose to remember vividly, entails several similar \nallegations based on varying facts, and yet contains no extraordinary deviations. He has \ncompleted anger management coursework and had no other incidents in over four \nyears. He has no contact with his ex-wife and cordial, albeit limited, contract with his ex-\ngirlfriend, while maintaining positive relationships with his children and his ex-girlfriend\u2019s \nchildren. With the exception of Applicant\u2019s ex-wife, he has the support of all individuals \ninvolved, including his ex-girlfriend\u2019s former husband. Applicant has moved on with his \nlife and is past the child rearing stage. It is highly unlikely he will again be caught in \nsuch domestic dramas again. I find Applicant raised mitigating concerns AG \u00b6\u00b6 17(d), \n(e), and (g). \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d). Under AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate \ndetermination of whether to grant eligibility for a security clearance must be an overall \ncommonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the guidelines and the \nwhole-person concept.  \n \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments \nunder the two applicable guidelines in my whole-person analysis. I also considered \n\n \n \n \n \n10\nApplicant\u2019s highly credible testimony, his education, family dynamics. divorce, \nbehavioral changes, maturation, and current lifestyle. \n \n \nApplicant is a 53-year-old systems engineer who has served in the same position \nfor the past 15 years and maintained a security clearance without incident for 13 years. \nSuccessful at work, he has a high school diploma and completed some college courses. \nHe is the divorced father of two grown children, and helped raised to girls who were the \ndaughters of a long-term girlfriend.   \n \n \nBetween 1983 and 2015, Applicant was cited for multiple criminal and personal \nconduct issues. With the exception of two DUI charges, a matter addressed when he \nchanged his drinking and driving patterns in 1996, the issues are related to either his \nex-wife or his relationship with a subsequent girlfriend and her two daughters. Given the \nnumber and timing of the ex-wife\u2019s charges and complaints, the ultimate disposition in \nthose matters, and her apparent abandonment of the children since they reached their \nmajority, it appears that issues regarding personal conduct are more appropriately \npinned on her.  \n \nAs for the 2015 family brouhaha, Applicant was clearly acting in a fatherly \ncapacity and also backing up his girlfriend when he tried to stop her teenage daughter \nfrom going out with a man in his 20s. A fight ensued, with each party entering at \ndifferent points, with only Applicant, the teen who wanted to go on the date, and the \nsuitor being there throughout. The teen agrees Applicant was the victim, not the \naggressor in the incident. Regardless, any wounds have healed, and Applicant \npresently gets on well with his ex-girlfriend\u2019s two daughters. The incidents in this case \nare unique and involve equally unique family dynamics. As previously noted, Applicant \nis no longer in the child-rearing stage of his life. The roots of his problems in the two \nrelationships at issue have either moved on, gone away, or been healed. In light of all \nthis, and given the passage of over four years without any further incidents, I find \nApplicant mitigated criminal conduct and personal conduct security concerns.    \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline J:  \n \n \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.g: \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \n \n \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.a-2.e: \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n11\nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant a security clearance. \nEligibility for access to classified information is granted. \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nArthur E.

Sykstus, Esq. \n______________ \nDecision \n______________ \nHESS, Stephanie C., Administrative Judge: \nWhile Applicant\u2019s financial difficulties arose from circumstances largely beyond his \ncontrol, he failed to act reasonably under the circumstances and did not mitigate the \nsecurity concerns raised by his finances. Eligibility for access to classified information is \ndenied. \nStatement of the Case \nApplicant submitted a security clearance application (e-QIP) on February 25, 2016. \nOn April 13, 2017, the Department of Defense (DOD) sent him a Statement of Reasons \n(SOR), alleging security concerns under Guidelines F (Financial Considerations). The \nDOD acted under Executive Order (Ex. Or.) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information \nwithin Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense \nIndustrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended \n(Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) implemented by DOD on September 1, \n2006.  \nApplicant submitted his Answer to the SOR on May 9, 2017, and requested a \nhearing before an administrative judge. Department Counsel was ready to proceed on \n02/08/2019\n\n2 \n \nJune 22, 2017, and the case was originally scheduled for hearing with another \nadministrative judge on March 6, 2018. The hearing was subsequently canceled and the \ncase was assigned to me on March 20, 2018. On May 20, 2018, the Defense Office of \nHearings and Appeals (DOHA) notified Applicant, through counsel, that the hearing was \nscheduled for June 5, 2018. I convened the hearing as scheduled. Government Exhibits \n(GX) 1 through 5 were admitted into evidence without objection. Applicant testified, \nsubmitted Applicant\u2019s Exhibits (AX) A through WW, which were admitted without \nobjection, and called five witnesses. DOHA received the transcript (Tr.) on June 13, 2018.  \n  \nThe SOR was issued under the AG implemented on September 1, 2006. The DOD \nimplemented the amended AG on June 8, 2017, while this decision was pending. This \ndecision is based on the amended AG effective June 8, 2017.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant, 46, is a systems engineer currently employed by a defense contractor \nsince January 2014. He served on active duty in the U.S. Army from March 1994 until he \nretired in March 2014. His service included three combat tours, and he received \nnumerous metals and commendations, including a Bronze Star for meritorious service. \nHe and his current wife married in 2001. They have four adult children and twins in high \nschool. Applicant was first granted a security clearance in 1994. (GX 1; AX A; AX II \nthrough WW; Tr. 14.)  \n \nUnder Guideline F, the SOR alleges four debts totaling $36,884 and a Chapter 13 \nbankruptcy discharged in 2006. Applicant admits each of these allegations. The \ndelinquent debts are reflected in Applicant\u2019s February 2017 and April 2016 credit bureau \nreports (CBR) and discussed during his September 2016 personal subject interview (PSI). \n(GX 5; GX 4; GX 2.) Applicant\u2019s admissions are incorporated in my findings of fact. \n \nPrior to their marriage and 2001, both Applicant and his wife individually filed \nChapter 13 bankruptcy. (Tr. 59.) The bankruptcies were discharged in 2006. (GX 3.) \nApplicant and his wife struggled financially early in their marriage, in part because they \nwere both active duty and not earning significant salaries, and because of the size of their \nhousehold. (Tr. 20.) However, Applicant was promoted and their finances had otherwise \nstabilized, so Applicant purchased a boat for $28,694 in April 2008. (GX 4; GX 5; Tr. 35; \nTr. 65.) \n \n \nBoth Applicant and his wife testified that Applicant\u2019s wife is responsible for \nmanaging the household finances. (Tr. 45; Tr. 60.) Applicant attributes his financial \ndifficulties to the combined impact of several events in 2011. Applicant\u2019s wife was eligible \nto retire from the military in 2011. They reviewed their finances and determined that if \nApplicant deployed, he would receive greater pay and his wife could retire. She retired in \nMay 2011. Applicant\u2019s wife was approved for 80% disability compensation upon \nretirement, but did not start receiving payments until approximately May 2012. Applicant\u2019s \nwife\u2019s reduced income and delayed disability compensation created greater financial \nstrains on the household. (Tr. 59-60.) \n\n3 \n \nAdditionally, the vehicle Applicant\u2019s wife was driving during this time had major \nengine trouble that required repairs that cost $7,000 to $9,000. (Tr. 52; Tr. 27.) Despite \nthe fact that Applicant had purchased an extended warranty for the vehicle, the dealership \nwould not honor the warranty. The vehicle underwent several repair attempts, but never \nran properly, and eventually became inoperable. At some point, Applicant stopped \nmaking payments, and the vehicle was ultimately repossessed. (Tr. 26-28.) The $7,241 \nbalance (SOR \u00b6 1.b) was charged-off in March 2012. (GX 4.) \n \nIn September 2011, Applicant\u2019s son was in an accident that resulted in third-degree \nburns and had to be airlifted to a hospital in another city for medical treatment. Applicant \nwas deployed and his wife had to travel several hours from their home to see their son in \nthe hospital. This resulted in travel-related and childcare costs as well as medical bills. \n(Tr. 50; GX 2.) \n \nDue to the increased financial stressors, Applicant fell behind on his monthly \nobligations, including his monthly boat payments of approximately $500. Applicant \nattempted to negotiate with the creditor, but the creditor demanded a full lump-sum \npayment. Applicant\u2019s last payment on the boat was in September 2011, and the boat was \nlater voluntarily repossessed. (Tr. 36-37; GX 4.) Applicant believes the boat was sold at \nauction. The creditor charged-off the $28,694 original loan amount (SOR \u00b6 1.c) in June \n2014. (GX 4.) Applicant\u2019s wife testified that the creditor sent Applicant letters attempting \nto collect the debt, but because they did not have the money to pay the debt, she did not \nrespond. (Tr. 70.) She further stated that between 2012 and 2016 she \u201cdid not make any \neffort to pay the debts . . . we did start making more money in 2014, but honestly it had \nbeen so long that I didn\u2019t make any effort to pay those.\u201d (Tr. 74.) \n \nApplicant discussed his delinquent accounts with the investigator during his PSI in \nSeptember 2016. At that time, Applicant stated that he did not know the status of the \n$7,241 repossessed-vehicle debt (SOR \u00b6 1.b) or the $28,694 repossessed-boat debt \n(SOR \u00b6 1.d) and had not had any contact with the creditors. The investigator confronted \nApplicant with several other delinquent accounts including the $605 credit-card debt \n(SOR \u00b6 1.c) and the $344 cellular telephone debt (SOR \u00b6 1.e). Applicant was unaware of \nthese debts but stated that he would consult his wife, and if the debts were valid, he would \nattempt to resolve them within the next 30 days. (GX 2.) In his Answer, Applicant stated \nthat, \u201cnow that we are financially able and I am aware of the repercussions, I intend to \npay these debts.\u201d   \n \nApplicant testified that the first time he recalls being aware of his delinquent debts \nwas in 2016 when reviewing his CBR with the mortgage broker. (Tr. 51-52.) He further \ntestified that the mortgage broker advised Applicant not to contact the creditors of or to \nmake payments on the outstanding $7,241 repossessed-vehicle debt or the $28,694 \nrepossessed-boat debt. Applicant explained that the mortgage broker stated that the \ndebts were old, but any activity on the accounts could reactivate them, which could result \nin a negative impact on Applicant\u2019s credit and ability to qualify for a favorable interest rate. \n(Tr. 52-53.) Applicant also stated that the mortgage broker told him that paying the \ndelinquent accounts would result in Applicant\u2019s not being \u201cable  to  purchase  the  home \n\n4 \n \nbecause  our  credit  rating  would drop.\u201d (Tr. 30-31.) Applicant opted not to contact the \ncreditors. (Tr. 37.)  \n \nApplicant received an IRS 1099 C Forgiveness of Debt Form in 2017, and paid the \nrequired tax. (Tr. 45.) Neither Applicant nor his wife specifically recognize the $605 credit-\ncard debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.c. (Tr. 39; Tr. 69.) The debt was charged off in September \n2010. The $344 delinquent cellular telephone account (SOR \u00b6 1.e) was last paid in \nSeptember 2009 and transferred to collection in November 2011. (GX 5.) In December \n2017 or January 2018, when the initial hearing was pending, Applicant was concerned \nabout any remaining delinquent accounts. He contacted the creditors of these two \naccounts and paid them by telephone. (Tr. 39.) SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b, 1.c, and 1.e have been \nresolved. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s four character witnesses, all of whom hold security clearances and \nknow Applicant professionally and personally, have served with or worked with Applicant. \nThe witnesses collectively testified to the strength of Applicant\u2019s character, stating that \nApplicant had an outstanding reputation of integrity, honesty, trustworthiness, and \ndedication. (Tr. 75-93.) Applicant\u2019s 1997 to 2013 military evaluation reports are positive, \nand his service school academic evaluations show that he met or exceeded course \nstandards. (AX I through FF.) He received the following awards for his military service: \nArmy Achievement medal 1996, 1999, 2000; Armed Forces Expeditionary medal 1996; \nGood Conduct medal 1997, 2003, 2005; Army Commendation medal 2003, 2004, 2008, \n2010; Bronze Star medal 2008; and Meritorious Service medal 2013. Applicant\u2019s 2014 to \n2017 employee performance reviews show that Applicant met or exceeded performance \nexpectations and that Applicant was a valuable team member and a key asset to the \nprograms on which he has worked. (AX E through AX H.) \n  \nApplicant\u2019s current monthly net income is $4,400, and he and his wife both receive \nmilitary retirement and disability compensation payments. Their net monthly household \nincome is approximately $11,100. (Tr. 41-43.) Applicant and his wife both testified that \nthey are currently in a good financial position. (Tr. 41; Tr. 67.) Applicant purchased a \nhouse in July 2016 with a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage-loan of 3.75%.1 (Tr. 31.) His \nmonthly loan payment as of December 2016 was $2,108. (GX 5.) Applicant did not submit \na written budget, nor is there any reference to maintaining a budget in Applicant\u2019s or his \nwife\u2019s testimony. Applicant contributes $2,000 a month to his 401(k) and pays $6,000 \nannually for additional medical insurance. Applicant testified that he does not have any \nother delinquent accounts. (Tr. 48.) There is no other record evidence regarding \nApplicant\u2019s financial obligations. Neither of the parties submitted a current credit bureau \nreport. Applicant has not taken any action to dispute his debts with credit reporting \nagencies. (Tr, 45-46.) Applicant does not have a plan to resolve his remaining delinquent \ndebt. \n \n \n \n                                            \n1 The national average annual mortgage-loan interest rate for 2016 was 3.65% with .05 points, with the July 2016 \naverage of 3.44% with .05 points.  www.freddiemac.com, January 30, 2019. \n\n5 \n \nPolicies \n \n \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended.  \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant\u2019s meeting the \ncriteria contained in the AG. These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, \nrecognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge applies these \nguidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative \njudge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available and reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable. \n \n \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d  See Exec. Or. \n10865 \u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the \napplicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense \nhave established for issuing a clearance. \n \n \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 92-1106 at 3, \n1993 WL 545051 at *3 (App. Bd. Oct. 7, 1993).  \n \n \n \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, \n\n6 \n \nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-\n31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).  \n \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-\n20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18:  \n \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness \nto abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about an \nindividual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified or \nsensitive information. \n \n \n \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an individual might knowingly \ncompromise classified information in order to raise money. It encompasses concerns \nabout an individual\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting \nclassified information. An individual who is financially irresponsible may also be \nirresponsible, unconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified \ninformation. See ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \n \n \n \nThe record evidence establishes two disqualifying conditions: \n \nAG \u00b6 19(a): inability to satisfy debts; and \n \nAG \u00b6 19(c): a history of not meeting financial obligations.  \n \nThe following mitigating conditions are potentially applicable: \n \nAG \u00b6 20(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not \ncast doubt on the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \nAG \u00b6 20(b): the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n \n\n7 \n \nAG \u00b6 20(c): the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling \nfor the problem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit \ncredit counseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem \nis being resolved or is under control; and \n \nAG \u00b6 20(d): the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to \nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s financial difficulties began in 2011 due to several events that were \nlargely beyond his control. Specifically, Applicant\u2019s son was severely injured in an \naccident, Applicant\u2019s wife\u2019s income decreased, and Applicant\u2019s vehicle required costly \nrepairs. The financial strain caused by these events resulted in Applicant\u2019s inability to \nmaintain his financial obligations. However, Applicant has not acted reasonably in \nresolving his debts. Applicant has been aware of his delinquent accounts since 2016. On \nthe advice of his mortgage broker, Applicant took no action to satisfy his delinquent \naccounts because he was concerned he would not qualify for a mortgage loan. Applicant \nsecured a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage loan in 2016, but did not subsequently take any \nsteps to resolve his delinquent accounts. Applicant paid SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c and 1.e, totaling \n$949 in December 2017 or January 2018 because he was concerned about the impact \nof delinquent accounts on his security clearance. The $7,241 debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.b \nwas resolved by the creditor\u2019s forgiveness of the debt, not by any affirmative action taken \nby Applicant. The $28,694 charged-off debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.d remains unresolved and \nApplicant does not have a plan to pay it. \n \n \nThe appeal board has regularly held that \u201capplicants who only begin to address \ntheir security-significant conduct when their personal interests are at stake may be lacking \nin judgment and reliability. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 15-06707 at 3 (App. Bd. Aug. 15, \n2017.)  \n \n \n \nAlthough Applicant does not have any recent delinquent accounts, his failure to \nresolve his delinquent debt casts doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, and good \njudgment. Additionally, Applicant acted in his own personal interests in securing a \nmortgage ahead of his legal obligation to satisfy his debts. His eleventh-hour payment of \ntwo SOR debts and the creditor\u2019s forgiveness of a third does not constitute a good-faith \neffort to resolve his debts. \u201cGood faith\u201d means acting in a way that shows reasonableness, \nprudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation. ISCR Case No. 99-0201, 1999 \nWL 1442346 at *4 (App. Bd. Oct. 12, 1999). There is no evidence that Applicant has \nparticipated in financial counseling, and he does not have a plan to resolve his remaining \ndelinquent account. None of the mitigating conditions apply. Applicant\u2019s 2001 Chapter 13 \nbankruptcy does not create any current security concerns. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-\n\n8 \n \nperson concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process \nfactors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \n \n \nI have incorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. \nSome of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were addressed under those guidelines, but I have also \nconsidered the following: \n \n \n \nApplicant served honorably in the U.S. Army for more than 20 years, including \nthree combat deployments, during which time he received multiple accolades for his \nservice. He has held a security clearance for more than 30 years. He is considered to be \ntrustworthy and is respected by his colleagues and friends. However, while he has not \nincurred any significant recent delinquent debt, the unresolved delinquent SOR debt \nremains a concern.  \n \n \n \nAfter weighing the applicable disqualifying and mitigating conditions under \nGuideline F, and evaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude \nApplicant has not mitigated the security concerns raised by his delinquent debts. \nAccordingly, I conclude he has not carried his burden of showing that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant him eligibility for access to classified \ninformation. \n \n \nFormal Findings \n \nAs required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, I make the following \nformal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \n \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F (Financial Considerations): AGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.b \u2013 1.e: \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \n \n \n\n9 \n \nConclusion \n \n \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the interests of national security to \ngrant Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified \ninformation is denied. \n \n \n \nStephanie C. Hess \nAdministrative Judge \n \n \n \n \n",

Applicant engaged in a form \nof prostitution for about 12 months from 2016 to 2017 while holding a security clearance. \nHer claim that her behavior did not constitute prostitution is not persuasive. Sexual \nbehavior, criminal conduct, and personal conduct security concerns are not mitigated. \nAccess to classified information is denied.        \n  \nStatement of the Case \n \n \nOn October 9, 2013, Applicant completed and signed a Questionnaire for National \nSecurity Positions (SF 86) or security clearance application (SCA). (Government Exhibit \n(GE) 1) On April 16, 2018, the Department of Defense (DOD) Consolidated Adjudications \nFacility (CAF) issued a statement of reasons (SOR) to Applicant under Executive Order \n(Exec. Or.) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry, February 20, \n1960; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review \nProgram (Directive), January 2, 1992; and Security Executive Agent Directive 4, \nestablishing in Appendix A the National Security Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining \nEligibility for Access to Classified Information or Eligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position \n(AGs), effective June 8, 2017. (Hearing Exhibit (HE) 2)  \n \nThe SOR detailed reasons why the DOD CAF did not find under the Directive that \nit is clearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant or continue a security \n\n \n2 \n                                         \n \nclearance for Applicant and recommended referral to an administrative judge to determine \nwhether a clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked. Specifically, the \nSOR set forth security concerns arising under Guideline F (financial considerations). (HE \n2) On May 26, 2018, Applicant responded to the SOR, and she requested a hearing. (HE \n3) On August 22, 2018, the DOD CAF issued a replacement SOR setting forth security \nconcerns under Guidelines F (financial considerations), J (criminal conduct), D (sexual \nbehavior), and E (personal conduct). (HE 4)    \n \nOn September 1, 2018, Applicant responded to the replacement SOR. (HE 5) On \nJanuary 10, 2019, Department Counsel was ready to proceed. On January 25, 2019, the \ncase was assigned to me. On April 12, 2019, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals \n(DOHA) issued a notice of hearing, setting the hearing for July 1, 2019. (HE 1) Applicant\u2019s \nhearing was held as scheduled using video teleconference.  \n  \nAttached to Applicant\u2019s second SOR response were 20 exhibits, which were \nadmitted without objection. (Transcript (Tr.) 12-13, 23-24; Applicant Exhibit SOR response \n(AE SR) A-AE T) During the hearing, Department Counsel offered nine exhibits; Applicant \noffered five additional exhibits; and all proffered exhibits were admitted into evidence. (Tr. \n15-18, 26-27); GE 1-9; AE A-AE E). On July 11, 2019, DOHA received a transcript of the \nhearing. Applicant did not provide any post-hearing documents.   \n \nSome details were excluded to protect Applicant\u2019s right to privacy. Specific \ninformation is available in the cited exhibits and transcript pages. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn Applicant\u2019s SOR response, she admitted SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.r and 4.b, and she denied \nthe other SOR allegations. She also provided extenuating and mitigating information. \nApplicant\u2019s admissions are accepted as findings of fact. Additional findings of fact follow.  \n \nApplicant is 42 years old, and a DOD contractor employs her as a management \nspecialist in Afghanistan. (Tr. 29, 88, 90) She served in the Army from 1996 to 2000, and \nshe received an honorable discharge. (Tr. 89-90) In 2006, she received an associate\u2019s \ndegree. (GE 1) \n \nIn 1999, Applicant married, and in September 2016, her divorce was final. (Tr. 89) \nHer three children are teenagers. (Tr. 89) In August 2014, Applicant filed for divorce. (Tr. \n50, 57) She paid \u201cwell over $30,000\u201d to her divorce attorney. (Tr. 51) She received security \ntraining in 2012. (AE SR R) \n \nFinancial Considerations \n \nWhile Applicant was deployed to Afghanistan, she believed her husband was \npaying the family bills, and she was unaware of the delinquent SOR debts. (Tr. 52) After \nshe learned of her delinquent debts, she reduced her expenses, especially her rent. (Tr. \n53) She cashed in her 401(k) account to pay her debts. (Tr. 54) She paid all of the SOR \ndebts; however, she noted the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.a for $1,438 is still listed as delinquent on \n\n \n3 \n                                         \n \nher current credit report. (Tr. 16, 37, 55) The status and disposition of the debts alleged \non the SOR are as follows:  \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.a alleges a charged-off debt for $1,438. On June 7, 2018, Applicant paid \nthe creditor $1,000, and the debt was settled. (AE B; AE SR S) However, on September \n1, 2018, Applicant emailed that her credit report had not been updated to reflect resolution \nof this debt. (SOR response) I have credited her with resolving this debt.  \n \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b, 1.h, and 1.l allege telecommunications debts placed for collection for \n$783, $173, and $783. On May 16, 2018, Applicant paid the SOR \u00b6 1.b creditor $783. \n(AE C at 1; AE SR D) On May 14, 2018, Applicant paid the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.h. (AE SR N; \nAE C at 26) The accounts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b and 1.l reflect the same debt. (SOR response) \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.c alleges a charged-off debt for $599. On May 18, 2018, the creditor wrote \nApplicant\u2019s debt was paid in full as of January 13, 2016. (AE C at 23-24)  \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.d alleges an account placed for collection for $588. On May 24, 2018, the \ncreditor wrote that the debt was resolved, and the balance owed was zero. (AE C at 13) \n \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.e, 1.f, 1.i, 1.j, 1.p, and 1.q allege six delinquent medical debts for $572, \n$360, $92, $1,572, $165, and $165. SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.e, 1.f, 1.i, 1.j, 1.p, and 1.q do not allege \nspecific creditors seeking payment of the medical debts. On May 14, 2018, Applicant paid \na medical collection debt of unspecified amount. (AE SR O; AE C at 12) On May 15, 2018, \nApplicant paid the creditor in SOR \u00b6 1.j $1,572. (AE C at 7) The creditor provided an \nundated letter stating the debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.p and 1.q were paid by insurance. (AE SR \nP; AE SR H; AE C at 25) On May 15, 2018, Applicant received an email indicating her 12 \nmedical debts for $1,589, $595, $1,633, $91, $100, $3,145, $339, $83, $190, $190, $85, \nand $24, were being paid in full. (AE C at 29-43) \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.g alleges a debt placed for collection for $350. On September 1, 2018, \nApplicant indicated in an email that the creditor had closed the account and would not \naccept payment. (SOR response)  \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.k alleges an account placed for collection for $1,255. On May 14, 2018, \nApplicant paid $1,255 to the creditor. (AE C at 28; AE SR C) \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.m alleges an account placed for collection for $539. On May 24, 2018, \nthe creditor wrote that Applicant\u2019s debt was resolved, and the balance owed was zero. \n(AE C at 10) \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.n alleges a charged-off debt for $486. On May 24, 2018, the creditor wrote \nApplicant\u2019s account was resolved, and the balance owed was zero. (AE SR J)  \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.o alleges an account placed for collection for $468. On May 24, 2018, the \ncreditor wrote that Applicant\u2019s debt was resolved, and the balance owed was zero.

On May 15, 2018, a student loan creditor wrote a defaulted student loan of \nunspecified amount was paid in full in August 2012. (AE C at 3) On June 7, 2018, \nApplicant paid a student loan for $2,505. (AE C at 6) On July 3, 2018, a student loan \ncreditor wrote that five student loans of $5,500, $3,387, $2,750, $208, and $758 were \npaid in full. (AE C at 15-22) On January 7, 2019, three student loans for $3,353, $7,326, \nand $5,500 were paid in full. (AE C at 4-5)    \n \nApplicant did not include her income of about $5,000 from customers seeking her \ntime and other personal services on her 2016 federal income tax return. In ISCR Case \nNo. 03-20327 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, 2006), the Appeal Board listed five circumstances \nin which conduct not alleged in an SOR may be considered stating:  \n \n(a) to assess an applicant\u2019s credibility; (b) to evaluate an applicant\u2019s \nevidence of extenuation, mitigation, or changed circumstances; (c) to \nconsider whether an applicant has demonstrated successful rehabilitation; \n(d) to decide whether a particular provision of the Adjudicative Guidelines is \napplicable; or (e) to provide evidence for whole person analysis under \nDirective Section 6.3.  \n \nId. (citing ISCR Case No. 02-07218 at 3 (App. Bd. Mar. 15, 2004); ISCR Case No. 00-\n0633 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct. 24, 2003)). See also ISCR Case No. 12-09719 at 3 (App. Bd. \nApril 6, 2016) (citing ISCR Case No. 14-00151 at 3, n. 1 (App. Bd. Sept. 12, 2014); ISCR \nCase No. 03-20327 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, 2006)). I limited my consideration of \nApplicant\u2019s admission that she did not declare income from her customers in violation of \nthe Internal Revenue Code to the five purposes listed above.  \n \nCriminal Conduct, Sexual Behavior, and Personal Conduct \n \n \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.a, 3.a, and 4.a allege that Applicant was cited in March 2017 for \nprostitution and operating a business without a city license. SOR \u00b6 4.b alleges and \nApplicant admitted that she failed to timely report this citation to her security officer. (SOR \nresponse) Applicant did not report her arrest because her attorney told her not to do so \nbecause \u201cit would implicate [her] in a crime.\u201d (Tr. 76) \n \nIn March 2017, the police arrested Applicant at her residence. (Tr. 71) Applicant \nsaid she was not charged with operating a business without a license, and the prostitution \ncharge was dismissed because of lack of evidence that she engaged in prostitution. (Tr. \n75; SOR response, Order Dismissing Charge) After her arrest, she stopped seeking \ncustomers on a dating website. (Tr. 78, 81) After her Office of Personnel Management \n(OPM) personal subject interview (PSI), she reported the arrest to her security officer. (Tr. \n76-77) Applicant\u2019s counsel indicated the prostitution charge was a municipal violation and \nnot a violation of state law. (Tr. 16-17) In Applicant\u2019s state of residence, prostitution is a \nclass B misdemeanor, punishable by up to six months in jail and a fine of up to $500. \nUnder the statute in Applicant\u2019s state, \u00a7 567.020, \u201cA person commits the offense of \nprostitution if he or she engages in or offers or agrees to engage in sexual conduct with \nanother person in return for something of value to be received by any person.\u201d \n\n \n5 \n                                         \n \n \nApplicant believed her husband called the police and alleged she was engaged in \nprostitution. (Tr. 80; SR) Applicant criticized the credibility of a police officer involved in \nthe investigation of her prostitution charge. (Tr. 17-19) Her counsel cited a 2015 Eighth \nCircuit decision that named the police officer as having omitted information from an \naffidavit used to obtain a search warrant. (AE D) The magistrate noted information was \nomitted; however, the magistrate concluded that \u201cthe officer did not act intentionally or \nrecklessly to mislead the issuing judge.\u201d (AE D at 2) The district court judge agreed with \nthe magistrate. (AE D at 2-3) The Eighth Circuit found the omissions were negligent but \notherwise agreed the omissions were not made with deliberate falsity or reckless \ndisregard, and declined to suppress the product of the search. (AE D at 4, 6) Applicant \nalso provided a copy of a 2014 deposition of the same police officer relating to an alleged \nstalking incident the police officer investigated in 2012. (AE D) Applicant asserted the \npolice officer admitted in the deposition that he made a false statement in his investigation \nof the stalking allegation. (Tr. 17-20) Applicant and her former husband were not involved \nin the alleged stalking incident. (AE D)  \n \nApplicant\u2019s concerns about the officer\u2019s credibility have low relevance because \nApplicant did not contest most of the material facts in the police report. The only \ninformation Applicant challenged were the allegations, as summarized by the police \nofficer, of the two witnesses who said Applicant provided sex to them in exchange for \ntheir payments of the amounts specified on Applicant\u2019s Internet advertisement. (SOR \nReport) Written statements from the two witnesses were not included in the file. The two \nwitnesses were soldiers at a nearby military base, and Applicant\u2019s counsel said he was \nunable to locate them. Applicant\u2019s admissions at her hearing, and the advertisement and \npictures from the website are sufficient to establish the allegation of prostitution under the \nsubstantial evidence standard.     \n \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 3.b, 3.c, 3.d, and 4.a allege Applicant engaged in sex with strangers that \nshe met on websites, including a dating website with a history of being involved with \nprostitution. Her website posting indicated she charged $80 for 30 minutes and $150 for \n60 minutes. At least one man that she met online paid her $80 following sex. \n \nFor about one year from 2016 to 2017, Applicant\u2019s semi-nude photographs and \ncontact information were placed on a dating or escort website. (Tr. 60-63, 68-70; GE 5) \nHer time was available for $80 for 30 minutes and $150 for 60 minutes. (Tr. 61-63) She \noffered conversation, warmth, massage, dance, and a special event to her customers. \n(Tr. 61-62, 74) In April 2018, the Department of Justice (DOJ) issued a press release \nindicating the website Applicant was using to solicit customers was seized, as it was \u201cthe \ndominant marketplace for illicit commercial sex, a place where sex traffickers frequently \nadvertised children and adults alike.\u201d (Tr. 77; GE 9) \n \nOn March 11, 2017, the police stopped a vehicle that had just left Applicant\u2019s \nresidence. (GE 4) The driver was a soldier at a nearby military installation. The driver said \nhe had just paid Applicant $80 for sex. He said he also paid her $150 for sex on March 8, \n2017. (OPM ROI at 17) The police went to Applicant\u2019s residence and asked for the money \nthe witness paid her, and she provided four $20 bills. Id. Applicant told the police that she \nwas not engaging in prostitution. The police interviewed another witness who was a \n\n \n6 \n                                         \n \nsoldier at a nearby military installation, and he said he paid for sex about four times at \nApplicant\u2019s residence. Id. (police report) Applicant\u2019s lawyer said he was unable to locate \nthe two witnesses cited in the police report to challenge their credibility. (Tr. 45-46) When \nApplicant was questioned by the police, she \u201cwas concerned about the charge of \nprostitution as it would affect her security clearance.\u201d (GE 4)  \n \nApplicant had difficulty estimating how many people paid her for her time; however, \nshe estimated \u201cat least see[ing] 40 or more.\u201d (Tr. 64-66) She estimated that she had sex \nwith about 20 men. (Tr. 66-67) She was vague about how many of them paid after having \nsex with her. (Tr. 67-68) Some of the customers may have asked her for drugs; however, \nshe always refused to give them drugs. (Tr. 88) Applicant did not have anyone to protect \nher if the date with her customers became violent. (Tr. 87)  \n \nApplicant consistently denied that she engaged in prostitution. (Tr. 43, 47-48) She \ndenied that there was a direct relationship between the payment of funds and the sexual \nactivity. (Tr. 82; SR; GE 2) The purpose of the semi-nudity on her webpage was to \nencourage men to call her to go out with her. (Tr. 70) After the first date, some men \ncontinued their relationships with her and continued to pay her, and some did not pay her. \n(Tr. 71, 82) As for whether she was soliciting prostitution, Applicant explained, in an \nadvertisement a girl holding a soda may be wearing a bikini, \u201cbut that doesn\u2019t mean she\u2019s \na prostitute.\u201d (Tr. 93) Applicant held a security clearance in the 2016 to 2017 time period \nwhen her webpage advertised her time to customers. (Tr. 75) \n \nApplicant\u2019s spouse was vindictive towards her because of her conduct. Her \nhusband placed her pictures on a bad website to damage her reputation. (Tr. 38-42, 61; \nSOR response; GE 5) In 2016, he called her a prostitute at a basketball game their \nchildren were attending. (Tr. 39-40) He threatened to seek her conviction and sentencing \nto jail for prostitution. (Tr. 39) He sought an order barring her from seeing her children; \nhowever, the judge denied his motion, and he had to pay her attorney fees. (Tr. 40) Her \nhusband encouraged the police to investigate Applicant for engaging in prostitution. (Tr. \n41) \n \nApplicant conceded that she \u201cpresented [herself] in the wrong manner as far as \nthat [she] may have been doing an illegal action.\u201d (Tr. 80) At the time Applicant was \nutilizing the webpage to solicit customers, she had full-time employment and earned \n$53,500 annually. (Tr. 84) In 2016, she made a little more than $5,000 from the website. \n(Tr. 85) She did not include the income from the customers on her federal tax return for \ntax year 2016. (Tr. 85-86)     \n \nCharacter Evidence \n \nIn 2018, Applicant received two promotions and a certificate of appreciation from \nher employer. (Tr. 50) She served in Afghanistan in 2014, and she was serving in \nAfghanistan at the time of her hearing. (Tr. 48)  \n \nApplicant\u2019s program manager has known her since 2000. (Tr. 28-29) He described \nher as an excellent employee who is conscientious, reliable, and responsible. (Tr. 30-31) \n\n \n7 \n                                         \n \nShe did not commit any security or rule violations. (Tr. 36) He supported her for positions \nof greater responsibility and a security clearance. (Tr. 32-33)   \n \nPolicies \n \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the Executive \nBranch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security emphasizing, \n\u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. \n518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to control \naccess to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual \nis sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The President \nhas authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicant\u2019s eligibility for \naccess to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865. \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable.  \n \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nabout potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Clearance \ndecisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a \ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 7. \nThus, nothing in this decision should be construed to suggest that it is based, in whole or \nin part, on any express or implied determination about applicant\u2019s allegiance, loyalty, or \npatriotism. It is merely an indication the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the \nPresident, Secretary of Defense, and DNI have established for issuing a clearance. \n \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 at 2 \n(App. Bd. May 2, 1996). \n \n\n \n8 \n                                         \n \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it \nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d \nISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). The burden of disproving a \nmitigating condition never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 \n(App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if they must, \non the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nFinancial Considerations \n \nAG \u00b6 18 articulates the security concern for financial problems: \n \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. . . . An individual who is financially \noverextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or otherwise \nquestionable acts to generate funds. . . . \n \nThe Appeal Board explained the scope and rationale for the financial \nconsiderations security concern in ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012) \n(citation omitted) as follows: \n \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an applicant might \nknowingly compromise classified information in order to raise money in \nsatisfaction of his or her debts. Rather, it requires a Judge to examine the \ntotality of an applicant\u2019s financial history and circumstances. The Judge \nmust consider pertinent evidence regarding the applicant\u2019s self-control, \njudgment, and other qualities essential to protecting the national secrets as \nwell as the vulnerabilities inherent in the circumstances. The Directive \npresumes a nexus between proven conduct under any of the Guidelines \nand an applicant\u2019s security eligibility.  \n \n  \nAG \u00b6 19 includes three disqualifying conditions that could raise a security concern \nand may be disqualifying in this case: \u201c(a) inability to satisfy debts\u201d; \u201c(b) unwillingness to \nsatisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so\u201d; and \u201c(c) a history of not meeting financial \nobligations.\u201d The record establishes AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a), 19(b), and 19(c).  \n \nFive financial considerations mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially \napplicable in this case:  \n \n\n \n9 \n                                         \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control;  \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and   \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue.  \n \nThe DOHA Appeal Board concisely explained Applicant\u2019s responsibility for proving \nthe applicability of mitigating conditions as follows:  \n \nOnce a concern arises regarding an Applicant\u2019s security clearance \neligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance of \na security clearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th \nCir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991). After the Government \npresents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the \napplicant to rebut or mitigate those concerns. See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. The \nstandard applicable in security clearance decisions is that articulated in \nEgan, supra. \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access \nto classified information will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nDirective, Enclosure 2 \u00b6 2(b).  \n \nISCR Case No. 10-04641 at 4 (App. Bd. Sept. 24, 2013).  \n  \nA debt that became delinquent several years ago is still considered recent because \n\u201can applicant\u2019s ongoing, unpaid debts evidence a continuing course of conduct and, \ntherefore, can be viewed as recent for purposes of the Guideline F mitigating conditions.\u201d \nISCR Case No. 15-06532 at 3 (App. Bd. February 16, 2017) (citing ISCR Case No. 15-\n01690 at 2 (App. Bd. Sep. 13, 2016)). \n \nThe Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a \u201cgood faith\u201d effort \nto repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts:  \n\n \n10 \n                                         \n \nIn order to qualify for application of [the \u201cgood faith\u201d mitigating condition], an \napplicant must present evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or some other good-faith action aimed at resolving the \napplicant\u2019s debts. The Directive does not define the term \u201cgood-faith.\u201d \nHowever, the Board has indicated that the concept of good-faith \u201crequires \na showing that a person acts in a way that shows reasonableness, \nprudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.\u201d Accordingly, an \napplicant must do more than merely show that he or she relied on a legally \navailable option (such as bankruptcy) in order to claim the benefit of [the \n\u201cgood faith\u201d mitigating condition]. \n \n(internal citation and footnote omitted) ISCR Case No. 02-30304 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 20, \n2004) (quoting ISCR Case No. 99-9020 at 5-6 (App. Bd. June 4, 2001)). \n \nApplicant had an expensive divorce, which is a circumstance outside of her control \nthat adversely affected her finances. She showed her good faith, and she resolved all of \nthe SOR debts. There is sufficient assurance her financial problems are resolved, under \ncontrol, and will not recur in the future. Under all the circumstances, she established that \nfinancial considerations security concerns are mitigated. \n \nSexual Behavior \n \nAG \u00b6 12 contains the security concern for sexual behavior: \n \nSexual behavior that involves a criminal offense; reflects a lack of judgment \nor discretion; or may subject the individual to undue influence of coercion, \nexploitation, or duress. These issues, together or individually, may raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s judgment, reliability, trustworthiness, and \nability to protect classified or sensitive information. Sexual behavior \nincludes conduct occurring in person or via audio, visual, electronic, or \nwritten transmission. No adverse inference concerning the standards in this \nGuideline may be raised solely on the basis of the sexual orientation of the \nindividual. \n \nAG \u00b6 13 includes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying: \n \n(a) sexual behavior of a criminal nature, whether or not the individual has \nbeen prosecuted; \n \n(b) a pattern of compulsive, self-destructive, or high-risk sexual behavior \nthat the individual is unable to stop;  \n \n(c) sexual behavior that causes an individual to be vulnerable to coercion, \nexploitation, or duress;  and \n \n\n \n11 \n                                         \n \n(d) sexual behavior of a public nature or that reflects lack of discretion or \njudgment. \n \nApplicant advertised for her services from 2016 to 2017 using her semi-nude \nphotographs to encourage customers to call her. Some of her customers engaged in \nsexual activity with Applicant, and then some of them paid her $80 for 30 minutes, or $150 \nfor 60 minutes. Each time she engaged in sexual activity and received payment \nafterwards at this hourly rate from her customers, she committed a form of the prostitution \noffense.   \n \nIn a recent Appeal Board case, the Appeal Board assessed the security \nimplications of an applicant\u2019s claim that his behavior did not constitute prostitution as \nfollows: \n \n[He and his friend] each dated a couple of different women on this trip, they \npaid their bar fees, went to dinner and/ or dancing, and engaged in \nconsensual sexual activity. [He] engaged in sex with at least one to two \nwomen while on this trip. When they pay the bar fee, it does not mean they \nare paying for sex, sex is never discussed, and the women are not obligated \nto sleep with the men who pay their bar fee to take them out. Prostitution is \nillegal in Thailand. The women that they engaged in sexual activity with \nwere adults, and it was always consensual sex (no other details recalled). \n \n* \n* \n* \n \nApplicant\u2019s contention that he is not participating in prostitution brings to \nmind a Latin phrase, \u201cres ipsa loquitur,\u201d i.e., the thing speaks for itself. He \npaid money to engage in casual, sexual encounters. Despite his claim to \nthe contrary, the routine practice of paying a fee to remove random women \nfrom bars and then later on that same occasion engage in sexual activity \nwith them is a form of prostitution. In the above indented quote, Applicant \nadmitted that prostitution is illegal in Thailand. Disqualifying Condition 13(a) \nwas established. \n \nAdditionally, Applicant\u2019s conduct is at the very least high-risk sexual \nbehavior that calls into question his judgment. Such behavior establishes \ndisqualifying conditions under Guideline E that address conduct involving \nquestionable judgment. \n \nISCR Case No. 16-03690 at 3 (App. Bd. Aug. 15, 2018) (footnotes omitted). Applicant\u2019s \nconduct established AG \u00b6\u00b6 13(a), 13(c), and 13(d). \n \nAG \u00b6 14 lists conditions that could mitigate security concerns: \n \n(a) the behavior occurred prior to or during adolescence and there is no \nevidence of subsequent conduct of a similar nature; \n \n\n \n12 \n                                         \n \n(b) the sexual behavior happened so long ago, so infrequently, or under \nsuch unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or judgment; \n \n(c) the behavior no longer serves as a basis for coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; \n \n(d) the sexual behavior is strictly private, consensual, and discreet; and \n \n(e) the individual has successfully completed an appropriate program of \ntreatment, or is currently enrolled in one, has demonstrated ongoing and \nconsistent compliance with the treatment plan, and/or has received a \nfavorable prognosis from a qualified mental health professional indicating \nthe behavior is readily controllable with treatment. \n \nNone of the mitigating conditions fully apply. Applicant refused to admit that she \nengaged in the offense of prostitution. Taking responsibility for one\u2019s conduct is often \nconsidered the first step on the road to rehabilitation. Her multiple misdemeanor-level \ncriminal offenses of prostitution are relatively recent. She remains vulnerable to \nprosecution for the offenses until the statute of limitations runs. She is also vulnerable to \ncoercion for her conduct. She did not receive any therapy or counseling. She failed to \ndeclare her income on her 2016 federal income tax return from customers meeting her \nbased on her webpage advertisement. Guideline D security concerns are not mitigated. \n \nCriminal Conduct \n \nAG \u00b6 30 described the concern relating to criminal conduct as follows: \n \nCriminal activity creates doubt about a person's judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person's ability or \nwillingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations. \n \nAG \u00b6 31 includes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying include: \n \n(a) a pattern of minor offenses, any one of which on its own would be \nunlikely to affect a national security eligibility decision, but which in \ncombination cast doubt on the individual's judgment, reliability, or \ntrustworthiness; \n \n(b) evidence (including, but not limited to, a credible allegation, an \nadmission, and matters of official record) of criminal conduct, regardless of \nwhether the individual was formally charged, prosecuted, or convicted; \n \n(c) individual is currently on parole or probation; \n \n\n \n13 \n                                         \n \n(d) violation or revocation of parole or probation, or failure to complete a \ncourt-mandated rehabilitation program; and \n \n(e) discharge or dismissal from the Armed Forces for reasons less than \n\u201cHonorable.\u201d \n \nAs discussed in the sexual behavior section, supra, AG \u00b6\u00b6 31(a) and 31(b) are \nestablished.  \n \nAG \u00b6 32 lists conditions that could mitigate security concerns: \n \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur and \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \n(b) the individual was pressured or coerced into committing the act and \nthose pressures are no longer present in the person's life; \n \n(c) no reliable evidence to support that the individual committed the offense; \nand \n \n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including, but not limited \nto, the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, restitution, \ncompliance with the terms of parole or probation, job training or higher \neducation, \ngood \nemployment \nrecord, \nor \nconstructive \ncommunity \ninvolvement. \n \nAs indicated in the sexual behavior section, supra, none of the mitigating \nconditions fully apply.  \n  \nPersonal Conduct \n \nAG \u00b6 15 explains why personal conduct is a security concern stating: \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process. \n \nAG \u00b6 16 includes two conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying include:  \n \n(d) credible adverse information that is not explicitly covered under any \nother guideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an adverse \n\n \n14 \n                                         \n \ndetermination, but which, when combined with all available information, \nsupports a whole-person assessment of questionable judgment, \nuntrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with \nrules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that the individual \nmay not properly safeguard classified or sensitive information. This \nincludes, but is not limited to, consideration of: . . . (3) a pattern of dishonesty \nor rule violations; and \n \n(e) personal conduct, or concealment of information about one's conduct, \nthat creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress by a \nforeign intelligence entity or other individual or group. Such conduct \nincludes: (1) engaging in activities which, if known, could affect the person's \npersonal, professional, or community standing. \n \nApplicant engaged in multiple misdemeanor-level acts of prostitution, which are \nviolations of the rules or statutes. Such conduct adversely affects her professional and \ncommunity standing. She failed to timely report that the police cited her for prostitution to \nher security officer, which is violation of a security rule.   \n \nAG \u00b6 17 provides seven conditions that could mitigate security concerns in this \ncase: \n \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; \n \n(b) the refusal or failure to cooperate, omission, or concealment was caused \nor significantly contributed to by improper or inadequate advice of \nauthorized personnel or legal counsel advising or instructing the individual \nspecifically concerning the security clearance process. Upon being made \naware of the requirement to cooperate or provide the information, the \nindividual cooperated fully and truthfully; \n \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that caused untrustworthy, unreliable, \nor other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to recur; \n \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate vulnerability \nto exploitation, manipulation, or duress;  \n \n(f) the information was unsubstantiated or from a source of questionable \nreliability; and \n\n \n15 \n                                         \n \n(g) association with persons involved in criminal activity has ceased or \noccurs under circumstances that do not cast doubt upon the individual's \nreliability, trustworthiness, judgment, or willingness to comply with rules and \nregulations. \n  \nApplicant\u2019s delay in reporting her citation by the police for prostitution to her \nsecurity officer was based on the advice of counsel. AG \u00b6 17(b) applies, and SOR \u00b6 4.b \nis mitigated. None of the mitigating conditions apply to Applicant\u2019s conduct as described \nin the sexual behavior section, supra. SOR \u00b6 4.a is not mitigated. Personal conduct \nsecurity concerns are not mitigated.  \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), \u201c[t]he ultimate determination\u201d of whether to grant a security \nclearance \u201cmust be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines\u201d and the whole-person concept. My comments under Guidelines F, D, J, \nand E are incorporated in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) \nwere addressed under those guidelines but some warrant additional comment. \n \nApplicant is 42 years old, and a DOD contractor employs her as a management \nspecialist in Afghanistan. She served in the Army from 1996 to 2000, and she received \nan honorable discharge. In 2006, she received an associate\u2019s degree.  \n \nApplicant mitigated the allegations under Guideline F. She made diligent and \neffective efforts to establish her financial responsibility. She resolved all of the debts listed \non her SOR.  \n \nIn 2018, Applicant received two promotions and a certificate of appreciation from \nher employer. She served in Afghanistan in 2014, and she was serving in Afghanistan at \nthe time of her hearing. Her program manager has known her since 2000. He described \nher as an excellent employee who is conscientious, reliable, and responsible. She did not \ncommit any security or rule violations. He supported her for positions of greater \nresponsibility and a security clearance.    \n\n \n16 \n                                         \n \nApplicant advertised for her services from 2016 to 2017 using her semi-nude \nphotographs to encourage customers to call her. After her customers engaged in sexual \nactivity with Applicant, they sometimes paid her $80 for 30 minutes, or $150 for 60 \nminutes. Each time she engaged in sexual activity and received payment of her hourly \nfee afterwards from her customers for such services, she committed a form of the \nprostitution offense. She continues to be vulnerable to prosecution for prostitution until \nthe statute of limitations runs. Applicant did not include the income she received for her \nservices on her federal income tax return.    \n \nIt is well settled that once a concern arises regarding an applicant\u2019s security \nclearance eligibility, there is a strong presumption against the granting a security \nclearance. See Dorfmont, 913 F. 2d at 1401. I have carefully applied the law, as set forth \nin Egan, Exec. Or. 10865, the Directive, and the AGs, to the facts and circumstances in \nthe context of the whole person. Unmitigated sexual behavior, criminal conduct, and \npersonal conduct security concerns lead me to conclude that grant of a security clearance \nto Applicant is not warranted.   \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n  \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT  \nSubparagraphs 1.a through 1.r: \nFor Applicant \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline J:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT  \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \n  \nAgainst Applicant \n \nParagraph 3, Guideline D:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT  \nSubparagraphs 3.a through 3.d: Against Applicant \n \nParagraph 4, Guideline E:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT  \nSubparagraph 4.a:   \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 4.b:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s \neligibility for a security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n_________________________ \nMark Harvey \nAdministrative Judge \n",
