Eligibility for access to classified \ninformation is denied. \nStatement of the Case \nApplicant submitted a security clearance application on April 4, 2016. On \nNovember 2, 2017, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications Facility (DOD \nCAF) sent her a Statement of Reasons (SOR) alleging security concerns under Guideline \nF and Guideline E. The DOD CAF acted under Executive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; \nDOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program \n(January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) \nimplemented by the DOD on June 8, 2017. \nApplicant answered the SOR on April 21, 2018, and requested a hearing before \nan administrative judge. The case was assigned to me on August 9, 2018. On September \n13, 2018, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) notified Applicant that the \n02/19/2019\n\n2 \n \nhearing was scheduled for October 16, 2018. The hearing was rescheduled for good \ncause and I convened the hearing on December 13, 2018. Government Exhibits (GX) 1 \nthrough 7 were admitted in evidence without objection. Applicant testified, presented two \nwitnesses, and submitted Applicant\u2019s Exhibits (AX) A through F, which were admitted \nwithout objection. At Applicant\u2019s request, I kept the record open until December 28, 2018, \nfor additional submissions. Applicant submitted (AX) G (a packet of documents) in a \ntimely manner. The exhibits was entered into the record without objection. DOHA \nreceived the transcript (Tr.) on January 2, 2019. \n \nFindings of Fact1 \n \n \nApplicant is a 59-year-old security officer for a federal contractor. She is divorced \nand has two adult children. She graduated from high school in 1979.  She has held a \nsecurity clearance  for about 20 years. She completed her security clearance application \n(SCA) on April 4, 2016. \n \nFinancial \n \n \nThe SOR alleges in 1.a-1.k, a 2012 Federal tax lien in the amount of $20,834;  \n2011 delinquent Federal taxes in the amount of $1,153.96; 2012 Federal delinquent taxes \nin the amount of $1,901.74; 2013 delinquent Federal taxes in the amount of $4,646.25; \n2014 delinquent Federal taxes in the amount of $828.90; 2015 Federal delinquent taxes \nin the amount of $3,223.10;  2016 delinquent Federal taxes in the amount of $458.72;  a \ncharged-off account in the amount of $113; a vehicle repossession balance of $8,862; a \ncollection account in the amount of $300; and a medical collection account for $63. \nApplicant admitted the financial allegations listed on the SOR and provided explanations. \n \n \nApplicant acknowledged that the tax lien and delinquent Federal taxes listed in \nSOR 1.a through 1.g are from 2011 to 2016. She explained that she timely filed her tax \nreturns for the years in question. (Tr. 43) Applicant explained that she helped her daughter \nfinancially and that was one reason for not paying the taxes. In her 2017 interview with \nan investigator, she thought that the original amount of $20,000 as a lien was due to her \nthen-husband filing jointly in 2008 and 2009, and his employer was not taking the correct \nwithholding amount of taxes from his pay. (GX 2)  Applicant stated that the tax bill was \ngiven to her in 2012. She thought her husband would take care of this bill, but he did not. \n(GX 2) In that interview, Applicant stated that she filed for a hardship notice with the IRS \nblaming her husband for the unpaid tax money, but she never heard anything from them. \nIn that same interview, she stated that she did not intend to pay that amount of money \nthat she believes her husband owes. (GX 2 at 12) \n \n \nAt the hearing Applicant explained that she has been in several payment plans \nwith the IRS beginning in April 2016. (Tr.44, GX 3) The first arrangement lasted for a \nperiod of time but was terminated by the IRS because Applicant did not maintain the $200 \n                                                          \n1 Applicant\u2019s personal information is extracted from her security clearance application (GX 1) unless \notherwise indicated by a parenthetical citation to the record. \n \n\n3 \n \nagreed upon monthly amount. (Tr. 46) She stated that she was between jobs, as she was \nterminated from a job in 2017. Applicant believes in June 2017, she started another \npayment arrangement, which was approved (AX C), but that was also terminated in \nAugust due to another tax obligation that was due. (Tr. 51)  In October 2018, Applicant \napplied for another payment agreement with the IRS. The IRS advised that  it is pending  \nand has not been approved. At this time, there is no payment plan in place. She presented \na \u201cpayoff calculator,\u201d which shows  a balance of $13,631.44 for taxes owed. (AX E) \n \n \nAs to SOR 1.h, a charged-off account in the amount of $113, this was a fraudulent \ncharge and she submitted documentation to prove the claim. (AE G ) \n \n \nAs to SOR i., Applicant explained that she co-signed for an auto loan for her \ndaughter. Her daughter testified at the hearing that she fell behind in the payments and \nthe car was repossessed. (Tr. 25) However, Applicant was not made aware of the \nsituation. Applicant\u2019s daughter paid the car loan in full and documentation was provided \nto support the assertion. (AE G) A small remainder of charges associated with the \nrepossession and storage are to be paid by Applicant\u2019s daughter who recently learned \nabout the charges. \n \n \nAs to SOR 1.j, a collection account in the amount of $300, Applicant has paid the \naccount in full and provided the receipt. (AE A) \n \n \nAs to SOR 1.k, the medical account for $63, Applicant did not know the origin of \nthe debt. She was later advised that it has been paid. (Tr. 62) She did not provide any \ndocumentation. \n \n \nApplicant provided documents and receipts for other accounts that she has paid in \na timely fashion. (AE F ) She also provided seven letters of recommendation from  a \nlandlord, church member and friends. Each letter attests to Applicant\u2019s charity, \ntrustworthiness and honesty. One of her former co-workers explained that she is a \nhardworking individual who has never had any difficulty with security violations. (AE F) \n \n \nA friend who has known Applicant for nine years stated that she is a loyal and \ndedicated professional as well as a caring friend. She always goes the extra mile. \nApplicant is described as dedicated, ethical and compassionate. (AE F) \n \n \nApplicant has not received financial counseling. Her net weekly pay is about $603. \n(AE B) She lives with a friend and pays for food and utility bills. She is current on her auto \nloan. She works overtime on occasions. She is current on her bills.  \n \n \nA co-worker testified that Applicant was always a dedicated security officer and  \nshe has known Applicant since 2010. She is also a personal friend of Applicant. The \nwitness described Applicant as detail oriented and always willing to do more to complete \ntask. (Tr. 32) \n \n \n\n4 \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \n \n \nApplicant completed her SCA on April 4, 2016. In response to Section 26- Financial \nRecord delinquencies or tax delinquencies, Applicant responded \u201cNo.\u201d She did not list the \ndelinquent Federal taxes from 2011 to 2016. She also answered \u201cNo\u201d in that section as \nto whether she had any routine delinquent accounts. (SOR 2.a and 2.b) \n \n \nApplicant has held a security clearance for about 20 years. However, in 2017, she \nwas terminated from her employment for removing items from a trash can and giving \nvague explanations. (SOR 2.c) Applicant stated that she was escorting the cleaning crew \nand  saw a writing pad and some wrapped plastic cups in a trash can in one of the offices \nthat were being cleaned. She was seen on camera with them under her arm. The 2017 \ninterview confirms this information. (GE 2) There is no other infraction noted in the \ninterview. \n \n \nApplicant denied all SOR allegations under personal conduct. She admitted that \nshe had been terminated but disputed the facts given for the termination. She explained \nthat she prides herself on being trustworthy and honest. Applicant had filled out one SCA \nbefore in pen and paper. This application was online and she said she was at work and \nrushed. She also believed that since she had been on payment plans with the IRS that \nshe did not have to answer \u201cYes.\u201d She noted at the hearing she misunderstood the \nquestions and that she should have answered in the affirmative. She was credible in her \ntestimony that she was in no way trying to lie to the Government. (Tr. 72) She did not \nfalsify her application. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nPolicies \n \n \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 2.  \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge \napplies these guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \n \n \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \n\n5 \n \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \n\u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \n \n \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 92-1106 at 3, \n1993 WL 545051 at *3 (App. Bd. Oct. 7, 1993).   \n \n \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, \nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-\n31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).  \n \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-\n20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \n \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F (Financial Considerations) \n \nThe concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \n \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \n\n6 \n \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds . . . .  \n \n \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified information to raise money. It encompasses concerns about a \nperson\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting classified \ninformation. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information. See ISCR \nCase No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s admissions, corroborated by her credit reports, and failure to pay \nFederal   taxes that became delinquent, establish three disqualifying conditions under this \nguideline: AG \u00b6 19(a) (\u201cinability to satisfy debts\u201d); AG \u00b6 19(c) (\u201ca history of not meeting \nfinancial obligations\u201d); and 19(f) (\u201dfailure to  pay annual Federal,  state, or local income \ntax  as required.\u201d \n \n \nThe security concerns raised in the SOR may be mitigated by any of the following \npotentially applicable factors: \n \nAG \u00b6 20(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not \ncast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \nAG \u00b6 20(b): the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \nAG \u00b6 20(c): the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling \nfor the problem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit \ncredit counseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem \nis being resolved or is under control;  \n \nAG \u00b6 20(d): the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to \nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n \nAG \u00b6 20 (g): the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax \nauthority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \n \n \nApplicant  has a history of not paying Federal taxes consistently for multiple years \ngoing back to at least 2008 through 2016. Applicant  has a significant tax lien and owes \nback taxes. She started several payment arrangements over the years, but they were \n\n7 \n \nterminated. Her latest plan has not been approved, but is still pending. She is not in a \npayment plan. AG 20(a) does not apply.  She is divorced and claims that her husband \ncontributed to the $20,000 tax lien, but in a statement in an investigative interview she \nstated that she was not going to pay it because it is the responsibility of her husband. \nHowever, they had filed jointly. Some payments have been made, but she still has \nunresolved tax debt and a lien that is not resolved.  As to the collection accounts, \nApplicant provided sufficient documentation that she has paid the collection accounts and \nthat one was fraudulent. AG \u00b6 20(b) only partially applies because I do not find that her \nattempts to resolve the significant tax issues are responsible. The last arrangement that \nApplicant made with the IRS is pending from 2018. Considering the factors, her financial \nsituation is not under control at this time. AG 20 (c) (d )and (g) do not fully apply. \n \n \nApplicant has not received financial counseling and did not provide a budget. She \nhas paid the collection accounts listed in the SOR and provided documentation that she \nis current on her bills. However, she has furnished insufficient formation to show that she \nhas the tax problems under control. Applicant has not mitigated the financial \nconsiderations security concern.  \n \nGuideline E (Personal Conduct) \n \nThe concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 15: \u201cConduct involving \nquestionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules \nand regulations can raise questions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and \nability to protect classified or sensitive information. . . .\u201d Applicant\u2019s  history establishes \nthe following disqualifying conditions under this guideline: \nAG \u00b6 16(c): credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas \nthat is not sufficient for an adverse determination under any other single \nguideline, but which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-person \nassessment of questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack \nof candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations, or other \ncharacteristics indicating that the individual may not properly safeguard \nclassified or sensitive information; \n \nAG \u00b6 16(d): credible adverse information that is not explicitly covered under \nany other guideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an adverse \ndetermination, but which, when combined with all available information, \nsupports a whole-person assessment of questionable judgment, \nuntrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with \nrules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that the individual \nmay not properly safeguard classified or sensitive information. This \nincludes, but is not limited to, consideration of . . . (2) any disruptive, violent, \nor other inappropriate behavior; [and] (3) a pattern of dishonesty or rule \nviolations; and \n \n\n8 \n \nAG \u00b6 16(e): personal conduct, or concealment of information about one's \nconduct, that creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress \nby a foreign intelligence entity or other individual or group. Such conduct \nincludes: (1) engaging in activities which, if known, could affect the person's \npersonal, professional, or community standing . . . . \n \n \nApplicant did not falsify her 2016 SCA. She made a mistake. She admitted at the \nhearing that she was rushed and in hindsight she should have answered \u201cYes\u201d to section \n26. As to the termination, there is little or no evidence to dispute Applicant\u2019s explanation \nof her removing something from a trash can or that she did not follow a policy. She has \nnever had any incidents of criminal activity or security violations. She has been open and \ncandid about her past, thereby reducing any vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or \nduress. \n \n \n \n \n \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-\nperson concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process \nfactors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \n \nApplicant has held a security clearance for 20 years. She had started several \npayment plans with the IRS in 2018.  She has paid the delinquent collection accounts \nlisted in the SOR. However, despite several attempts, she is not in a current payment \nplan with the IRS.  \n \n \nShe is making some strides with her delinquent taxes and lien but she has not \npresented sufficient information to mitigate the security concerns raised by her unpaid \ntaxes. \n \n \nShe did not intentionally falsify her security clearance application in 2016, and has \nmitigated the personal conduct security concerns. \n \n \n\n9 \n \n. \n \n \n \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F (Financial Considerations): AGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.g \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant:  \n \n \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.h-k: \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nParagraph 2, (Personal Conduct): \n \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 2.a-2.c: \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national security interests of the \nUnited States to continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nClearance is denied. \n \n \n \n \nNoreen A.

Applicant denied the allegations and indicated that there were extenuating circumstances. After considering the pleadings, exhibits, and transcript, I make the following findings of fact. Applicant is 53 years old and a computer network administrator. He has an Associate Degree in applied electronics technology awarded in May 1986. (GE 1; AEs A, I.) He has worked for a succession of defense contractors at the same military installation from August 1992 to October 2012 and from June 2014 to present. He was granted a secret clearance in 1994 that was renewed in 2007. (GE 1; AE I; Tr. 22-23, 26.) Applicant and his spouse married in 2002. (GE 1.) She took responsibility for paying the bills and completing and filing their income tax returns from the start of their marriage.

Temple, Esq., Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Michelle Daugherty, Esq. \n______________ \nDecision \n______________ \nMATCHINSKI, Elizabeth M., Administrative Judge: \nApplicant and his spouse did not timely file their federal income tax returns for tax \nyears 2012 through 2016, or their state income tax returns for tax years 2012 and 2014 \nthrough 2016. Applicant and his in-laws had some difficult health issues, but they do not \nfully mitigate Applicant\u2019s inattention to his tax-filing obligations for the past several years. \nClearance is denied. \nStatement of the Case \nOn December 8, 2017, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications \nFacility (DOD CAF) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant, detailing security \nconcerns under Guideline F, financial considerations. The SOR explained why the DOD \nCAF was unable to find it clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue \nsecurity clearance eligibility for him. The DOD CAF took the action under Executive Order \n(EO) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as \namended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review \nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the National Security Adjudicative \n11/01/2018\n\n2 \n \nGuidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information or Eligibility to \nHold a Sensitive Position (AG) effective within the DOD on June 8, 2017. \n \nApplicant responded to the SOR on January 13, 2018, and requested a hearing \nbefore an administrative judge from the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA). \nOn April 18, 2018, the case was assigned to me to conduct a hearing to determine whether \nit is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for \nApplicant. On April 23, 2018, I scheduled a hearing for May 15, 2018. \n \nOn May 9, 2018, Applicant\u2019s counsel entered her appearance. On May 11, 2018, \nshe requested a continuance, and Department Counsel had no objection. On May 14, \n2018, I cancelled the hearing. On August 6, 2018, I rescheduled the hearing for September \n19, 2018.  \n \nAt the hearing, five Government exhibits (GEs 1-5) were admitted. A February 8, \n2018 letter forwarding the proposed GEs to Applicant was marked as a hearing exhibit (HE \n1) for the record but not admitted in evidence. Ten Applicant exhibits (AEs A-J) were \nadmitted in evidence. Applicant and his spouse testified, as reflected in a transcript (Tr.) \nreceived on October 1, 2018. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nThe SOR alleges under Guideline F that Applicant failed to file his federal (SOR \u00b6 \n1.a) and state (SOR \u00b6 1.b) income tax returns for tax years 2012 through 2016. Applicant \ndenied the allegations and indicated that there were extenuating circumstances. After \nconsidering the pleadings, exhibits, and transcript, I make the following findings of fact. \n \nApplicant is 53 years old and a computer network administrator. He has an \nAssociate Degree in applied electronics technology awarded in May 1986. (GE 1; AEs A, I.) \nHe has worked for a succession of defense contractors at the same military installation \nfrom August 1992 to October 2012 and from June 2014 to present. He was granted a \nsecret clearance in 1994 that was renewed in 2007. (GE 1; AE I; Tr. 22-23, 26.) \n \nApplicant and his spouse married in 2002. (GE 1.) She took responsibility for paying \nthe bills and completing and filing their income tax returns from the start of their marriage. \nTheir joint income tax returns were filed on time through tax year 2011, and they received \nrefunds. (Tr. 73-74.) Applicant\u2019s spouse worked full time for a communications company for \nalmost 20 years. In August 2007, she acquired her real estate license. (Tr. 74.) \n \nApplicant was unemployed from October 2012 until June 2014 for medical reasons. \nHe had major surgery in the fall of 2012 and, in June 2013, he developed serious medical \ncomplications that resulted in him being placed in a medically-induced coma for 52 days. \nHe had subsequent medical setbacks. (Tr. 75-81.)  During his lengthy unemployment, \nApplicant\u2019s spouse had a power-of-attorney to handle their finances. She had to reduce her \nwork hours as a realtor to be with him when he was hospitalized, and then care for him \nwhen he was home. Applicant had some unemployment compensation and disability \n\n3 \n \nincome, but he also liquidated a 401(k) of approximately $152,000 in 2013, which paid for \nCOBRA medical insurance coverage and their mortgage when he was out of work. (Tr. 29-\n31, 78-83.) Applicant\u2019s spouse did not file federal or state income tax returns for tax year \n2012, and their federal return for tax year 2013.1 (GEs 1-2; AEs C-D, Tr. 55-57.) Their tax \nreturns were complicated because of several withdrawals from retirement accounts and her \nbusiness expenses as a self-employed realtor. (Tr. 56.) \n \nApplicant returned to work in June 2014 for a defense contractor at a nearby military \ninstallation located in a state that collects taxes on non-residents that earn income in the \nstate. (Tr. 32, 66-67.) Applicant assumed that federal and non-resident state taxes were \nwithheld from his pay. Apparently only recently, he learned that non-resident state income \ntaxes had not been withheld from his pay, and he rectified his withholding issue.2 (Tr. 59.) \n \nOn March 16, 2015, Applicant completed and certified to the accuracy of a \nQuestionnaire for National Security Positions (SF 86). In response to an inquiry concerning \nwhether he had failed to file or pay and Federal, state, or other taxes by law or ordinance in \nthe last seven years, Applicant indicated that he had not filed federal or state income tax \nreturns for tax years 2012 and 2013. He explained that he had been hospitalized for an \nextended time and was not able to file his tax returns for those tax years. During tax year \n2013, he prematurely withdrew retirement assets. He indicated that he would file his 2012 \nand 2013 tax returns at the same time, and that he expected refunds for tax year 2012, \nwhich he would use to pay any taxes owed for 2013. (GE 1.) Applicant relied on his spouse \nto file their income tax returns because she itemized her self-employment expenses. (Tr. \n67.) \n \nApplicant and his spouse filed their joint federal income tax return for tax year 2012 \non August 3, 2015. On adjusted gross income of $54,999, they were entitled to a $4,889 \nrefund. (AE C.) They filed their federal income tax return for tax year 2013 on August 17, \n2015. On adjusted gross income of $121,052, they underpaid their federal income taxes by \n$6,071 for tax year 2013. Their federal income tax refund for tax year 2012 was applied to \ntheir tax liability for tax year 2013. (AEs C-D.) With assessed penalties and interest, they \nowed approximately $1,618, which they paid. (GE 2; AE D.) Applicant did not present any \ndocumentation of his state income tax return for tax year 2012. Applicant\u2019s spouse testified \nabout 2012 and 2013 that they owed minimal state taxes for one year and were entitled to \na refund of approximately $2,200 for the other tax year. She advised the state to apply it to \nany taxes owed for subsequent tax years. (Tr. 94-95.) \n \nIn 2015, Applicant\u2019s parents-in-law were both diagnosed with cancer. Applicant\u2019s \nspouse put her realtor license in inactive status, and she took on caregiver responsibilities \n                                                 \n1 It is unclear whether Applicant and his spouse were required to file a state income tax return for tax year \n2013. He was unemployed that entire year, and there is no evidence that his spouse earned income in a state \nthat taxes employment income. There is no evidence that they were required to file a state return because of \nhis premature withdrawal of retirement assets. \n \n2 Applicant did not indicate when he learned state taxes had not been withheld from his pay. His and his \nspouse\u2019s joint income tax return for 2017 shows that no state income taxes were withheld for that tax year. \n(AE H.) What is clear is that no taxes were withheld before 2018, so his rectification of the issue is recent. \n\n4 \n \nfor her parents. Her father died in early September 2018. (Tr. 85-86, 98.) She felt \noverwhelmed by all of her obligations, and she did not file Applicant and her joint federal or \nstate income tax returns when they were due for tax years 2014 through 2016. (Tr. 69.) \nApplicant took no responsibility for filing their returns. His spouse had gathered most of the \npaperwork and thought she could handle it. (Tr. 99.)  \n \nOn May 3, 2017, Applicant was interviewed by an authorized investigator for the \nOffice of Personnel Management (OPM). He volunteered that he and his spouse had yet to \nfile their federal and state income tax returns for tax years 2014 and 2015, but that his \nspouse was working on them. He expressed hope that she would complete their returns for \n2014 and 2015 within the next week. He also indicated that their delinquent tax returns for \n2012 and 2013 were filed late; that they owed no federal or state income taxes for tax year \n2012, or state income taxes for 2013; and that they have paid their federal tax debt of \nabout $1,500 for tax year 2013. Applicant expected to owe no tax debt for tax years 2014 \nand 2015. He told the OPM investigator that he and his spouse \u201cjust now have time to sit \ndown and figure [their taxes] out.\u201d  (GE 2.) \n \nIn September 2017, the DOD CAF requested information from Applicant about his \ntax situation. On September 22, 2017, Applicant\u2019s spouse indicated that she is responsible \nfor their tax filing and that she was \u201calmost finished with 2014 and have 2015 and 2016 set \nup to complete as possible.\u201d She requested an extension of time for Applicant because of \nhealth issues with her parents, and she is their closest caregiver. Applicant was granted an \nextension to October 23, 2017, to respond to the DOD CAF\u2019s request. On October 27, \n2017, Applicant\u2019s spouse responded that they worked hard to meet the deadline but \n\u201ccircumstances beyond [their] control have made it impossible to get all the returns \ncompleted.\u201d Applicant\u2019s spouse indicated that her father was scheduled for upcoming \nsurgery, and she asked for more time. She added that she would continue to work on \ncompleting their tax returns. (GE 5.) \n \nOn December 8, 2017, the DOD CAF issued a SOR to Applicant because of his \nfailure to file federal and state tax returns by the filing deadlines for tax years 2012 through \n2016. In February 2018, Applicant and his spouse retained the services of an enrolled tax \nagent to assist them in preparing their delinquent income tax returns for tax years 2014 \nthrough 2016. (Tr. 87-88.) \n \n With the assistance of the tax agent, Applicant and his spouse filed their federal \nincome tax returns for tax years 2015 and 2016 on June 13, 2018. (AEs F-G.) Their state \nincome tax returns were for tax years 2015 and 2016 were completed on June 13, 2018, \nbut were not mailed until the week of September 9, 2018. (Tr. 98.) On joint adjusted gross \nincome of $57,384 in 2015, they overpaid their federal income taxes by $798. Their refund \nwas issued to them on July 9, 2018. (AE F.) No state taxes had been withheld from his pay \nfor tax year 2015, which resulted in a tax underpayment of $1,420. With penalties for late \npayment, they owed state taxes of $1,987 for tax year 2015. (AE F.) On adjusted gross \nincome of $57,159 in 2016, they overpaid their federal income taxes by $666. Their refund \nwas issued to them on July 9, 2018. No state taxes were withheld from his pay for tax year \n\n5 \n \n2016, and with penalties for failure to timely file and pay, they owed $1,747 in state taxes \nfor tax year 2016. (AE G.) \n \nThrough the enrolled tax agent, Applicant and his spouse requested an extension to \nOctober 15, 2018, to file their federal tax return for tax year 2017. On June 13, 2018, they \ntimely filed their federal return for tax year 2017. On adjusted gross income of $50,931 for \ntax year 2017, they overpaid their federal income taxes by $1,695. Their refund was issued \nto them on June 27, 2018. As with previous tax years, no state income tax had been \nwithheld from Applicant\u2019s pay. As a result, they underpaid their non-resident state income \ntaxes by $1,119. With a $45 underpayment penalty, they owed the state $1,197. (AE H.) \nThey mailed their state income tax return for tax year 2017 sometime during the week of \nSeptember 9, 2018. (Tr. 98.) \n \nAlso on June 13, 2018, the tax agent finished Applicant and his spouse\u2019s joint \nfederal and state income tax returns for tax year 2014. Based on the returns, Applicant and \nhis spouse underpaid their federal income taxes by $156 and their state income taxes by \n$135 ($201 with penalties) for tax year 2014. The tax returns could not be submitted \nelectronically, so the tax agent gave them to Applicant\u2019s spouse to mail. As of September \n10, 2018, the IRS had no record of Applicant and his spouse filing an income tax return for \ntax year 2014. (AE E.) Applicant\u2019s spouse did not file the returns until the week of \nSeptember 9, 2018, because she waited to see whether the IRS and state tax authority \nwould take part of their refunds for previous years and apply them to their tax liabilities. \nApplicant and his spouse paid the taxes owed for tax year 2014 when she mailed the \nreturns the week before his security clearance hearing. (Tr. 89-90.) Applicant and his \nspouse have not yet been billed for any delinquent state taxes, so they have not satisfied \ntheir state tax liabilities for 2015 through 2017, which totaled $4,931 per their returns. They \nare not sure what they owe. (Tr. 94.)  \n \nApplicant\u2019s spouse attributes her delay in addressing their tax filings to her parents\u2019 \nand her own medical issues, including since April 2017. Her father had an operation in \nOctober 2017, and he died in early September 2018. (Tr. 66, 86. 90.) She assumed that \nthey did not owe taxes because they \u201chad paid the taxes as [they] went along for the most \npart and it was just the reconciliation part that [she] didn\u2019t have time to deal with because of \nall the medical.\u201d (Tr. 102.) Applicant has recently taken on repayment responsibility for \nsome of the household expenses. (Tr. 91.) They intend to retain the services of the tax \nagent to prepare their future income tax returns. (Tr. 87, 93, 95, 99.) \n \nAs of April 2018, Applicant had some outstanding medical collection debt on his \ncredit record: $85 from May 2015; $1,211 (disputed) from November 2012; $66 from \nSeptember 2015; and $321 from May 2017. They were making timely payments of $1,256 \nper month on their mortgage loan obtained in May 2003. As of April 2018, the loan balance \nwas $93,538. Applicant was paying $262 per month on a credit card with a current balance \nof $12,818. He had been late 30 days in August 2017 on a car lease payment of $186 per \nmonth, but had been current since then. (AE I.)  \n \n\n6 \n \n \nApplicant received several awards from a previous employer for his dedication and \nvaluable contributions in support of the military installation. (AE A.) In October 2012, he \nreceived a letter of appreciation from his military customer for his expertise on high-priority \nprojects. (AE B.) Applicant completed voluntary training over the years to ensure that he \ncontinues to perform his duties in information systems security with professionalism and \nhigh quality. (AE A.) \n \n \nApplicant has the strong endorsement of present and former co-workers, who \nconsider him to be a network administrator of the highest quality. Applicant is relied on for \nhis knowledge and research. He has worked on \u201ccountless tasks and projects with \nsensitive and secret information\u201d and respected privacy and security requirements. \nApplicant is known for giving security issues priority and resolving them in a timely manner. \n(AE B.) \n  \nPolicies \n \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion the Executive \nBranch has in regulating access to information pertaining to national security,  emphasizing \nthat \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 \nU.S. 518, 528 (1988). When evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, \nthe administrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are required to be considered in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. These guidelines \nare not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, \nthese guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative \nprocess. The administrative judge\u2019s overall adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious \nscrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative \njudge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, \nfavorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence \nto establish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant \nis responsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \n\n7 \n \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation about potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Section 7 of EO 10865 \nprovides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a \ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section \n3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information). \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \n \n \nThe security concerns about financial considerations are articulated in AG \u00b6 18: \n \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness \nto abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about an \nindividual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified or \nsensitive information. Financial distress can also be caused or exacerbated \nby, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other issues of personnel security \nconcern such as excessive gambling, mental health conditions, substance \nmisuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An individual who is financially \noverextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or otherwise \nquestionable acts to generate funds. . . . \n \n \nThe Appeal Board explained the scope and rationale for the financial considerations \nsecurity concern in ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012) (citation omitted) \nas follows: \n \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an applicant might knowingly \ncompromise classified information in order to raise money in satisfaction of \nhis or her debts. Rather, it requires a Judge to examine the totality of an \napplicant\u2019s financial history and circumstances. The Judge must consider \npertinent evidence regarding the applicant\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other \nqualities essential to protecting the national secrets as well as the \nvulnerabilities inherent in the circumstances. The Directive presumes a \nnexus between proven conduct under any of the Guidelines and an \napplicant\u2019s security eligibility. \n \nApplicant did not timely file his federal income tax returns for tax years 2012 through \n2016 and his state income tax returns for tax years 2012, and 2014 through 2016. He and \nhis spouse were entitled to federal tax refunds every year except for tax year 2014, for \nwhich they owed $156. According to their returns submitted within the week preceding his \nsecurity-clearance hearing, they owed state income taxes of approximately $201 for 2014, \n$1,987 for 2015, and $1,747 for 2016. They filed their returns for tax year 2017 on time, \nbut they have yet to pay $1,197 in state taxes. Applicant did not have state taxes withheld \n\n8 \n \nfrom his pay for tax years 2014 through 2017. Guideline F security concerns are \nestablished when an individual fails to comply with his tax filing obligations whether or not \nany taxes are owed. Disqualifying condition AG \u00b6 19(f), \u201cfailure to file or fraudulently filing \nannual Federal, state, or local income tax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or \nlocal income tax as required,\u201d applies. \n \nApplicant has the burden of establishing that matters in mitigation apply. Applicant \ndelegated the filing of their joint income tax returns to his spouse, but he was still \nresponsible for ensuring compliance with such an important obligation as filing returns on \ntime and paying any taxes owed. Regarding possible mitigation under the AGs, one or \nmore of the following conditions under AG \u00b6 20 may apply: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under \nsuch circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the \nindividual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem from a \nlegitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit counseling service, \nand there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under \ncontrol; \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue; and  \n \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority \nto file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s failure to file timely federal and state income tax returns for five \nconsecutive tax years, from 2012 through 2016, is too recurrent and recent for mitigation \nunder AG \u00b6 20(a). Moreover, even though the delinquent tax returns have all been filed \nwith the submission of his and his spouse\u2019s joint federal tax return for tax year 2014 and \nstate tax returns for 2014 through 2016 during the week of September 9, 2018, their state \ntax situation has not been fully resolved. Assuming that they paid the taxes owed for 2014 \n\n9 \n \nas Applicant\u2019s spouse testified, they have made no payments toward $4,931 in state taxes \nowed for 2015 through 2017. \n \nApplicant has a case for partial mitigation under AG \u00b6 20(b). He had serious medical \nissues when his federal income tax returns for tax years 2012 and 2013, and his state \nincome tax return for 2012 were due. He was well enough to resume working in June 2014, \nhowever, and can reasonably be expected to comply with his tax filing obligations starting \nwith tax year 2014. Given his spouse\u2019s self-employment as a realtor, Applicant is not \nfaulted for delegating tax compliance to his spouse. Yet, Applicant exhibited poor judgment \nin failing to take some steps to ensure that their tax returns for tax years 2014 through \n2016 were filed, especially knowing that his spouse was becoming overwhelmed with \ncaregiver duties for her parents and that his unfiled tax returns were of concern to the \nDOD. Applicant took such a hands-off approach to his taxes that he failed to note that state \ntaxes were not being withheld from his pay for several years. Health issues for his spouse \nand her parents continued to take his spouse\u2019s attention, but Applicant has not provided a \ncredible explanation for his failure to take control over their tax situation. AG \u00b6 20(b) \nrequires that an individual act responsibly, and some concern arises in that regard because \nof Applicant\u2019s lack of oversight over his spouse\u2019s handling of their tax issues. \n \nAGs \u00b6\u00b6 20(c), 20(d), and 20(g) have some applicability in that their delinquent tax \nreturns have now all been filed. Applicant and his spouse expressed a credible intention to \nutilize the services of their tax agent to file their tax returns in the future. Even so, it is \ndifficult to fully mitigate the security concerns, given the delay in filing some of their income \ntax returns. They had to mail their state tax returns, which were completed in June 2018 by \nthe tax agent. His spouse held their state income tax returns for tax years 2014 through \n2016 and their federal income tax return for 2014 until September 2018, the week before \nApplicant\u2019s security-clearance hearing. She explained that she wanted to see whether any \nof their federal refunds would be applied toward their tax liabilities. However, available IRS \ntranscripts show that their federal income tax refunds for tax years 2015 and 2016 were \nissued to them on July 9, 2018. Their federal income tax refund for tax year 2017 was \nissued to them on June 27, 2018. Available information does not indicate that there were \nrefunds held by the IRS to apply toward their state income tax liabilities. AG \u00b6 20(e) applies \nonly in that the tax returns for tax years 2012 and 2013 were filed in August 2015, more \nthan two years before the SOR was issued in December 2017, even though they were filed \nlate. \n \n \nEven where tax problems have been corrected and an applicant is motivated to \nprevent such problems in the future, the administrative judge is not precluded from \nconsidering an applicant\u2019s trustworthiness in light of longstanding prior behavior evidencing \nirresponsibility. See e.g., ISCR Case No. 14-01894 at 5 (App. Bd. Aug. 2015). The Appeal \nBoard has long held that the failure to file tax returns suggests a problem with complying \nwith well-established government rules and systems. See e.g., ISCR Case No. 14-04437 \n(App. Bd. Apr. 15, 2016.) Moreover, the Appeal Board recently reaffirmed that the timing of \ncorrective action is an appropriate factor to consider in applying AG \u00b6 20(g). See e.g., ISCR \nCase No. 17-01382 at 4 (App. Bd. May 16, 2018) (citing ISCR Case No. 17-01807 at 3-4 \n(App. Bd. Mar. 7, 2018)). In reversing favorable clearance grants to applicants with tax \n\n10 \n \nissues by DOHA judges in ISCR Case No. 17-01382 (App. Bd. May 16, 2018) and ISCR \nCase No. 16-01211 (App. Bd. May 30, 2018), the Appeal Board noted that applicants who \nonly begin to address their delinquent tax returns after having been placed on notice that \ntheir clearance might be in jeopardy may not comply with laws, rules, and regulations when \ntheir immediate interests are not imperiled. In May 2017 and again in September 2017, \nApplicant was reminded that his tax matters were of concern for his clearance. There is no \nevidence that he and his spouse took any steps to resolve the concerns until February \n2018, when they retained the services of the tax agent. Circumstances suggest that had \nthe SOR not been issued, the tax returns would still be unfiled. Concerns about Applicant\u2019s \nfinancial judgment also persist because of his unexplained delay in addressing the tax \nwithholding issue to ensure that state taxes are withheld from his pay. \n  \nWhole-Person Concept \n \nIn assessing the whole person, the administrative judge must consider the totality of \nan applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant circumstances in light of the nine adjudicative \nprocess factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). The analysis under Guideline F is incorporated in my whole-\nperson analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were addressed under that guideline, but \nsome warrant additional comment. \n \n \nThe security clearance adjudication involves an evaluation of an applicant\u2019s \njudgment, reliability, and trustworthiness in light of the security guidelines in the Directive. \nSee ISCR Case No. 09-02160 (App. Bd. Jun. 21, 2010). Applicant\u2019s dedication to his work \nwith a defense contractor is unassailable, and there is no indication that he has exercised \npoor judgment on the job. Applicant and his spouse have had to deal with several serious \nmedical issues for themselves and family members that were clearly not foreseen. \nHowever, Applicant has also been able to work full-time for over four years now, and he \ncould reasonably have taken some steps before February 2018 to ensure that his tax \nissues were being addressed in a timely fashion with or without professional assistance. \nThe Appeal Board has repeatedly held that the government need not wait until an applicant \nmishandles or fails to safeguard classified information before denying or revoking security \nclearance eligibility. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 08-09918 (App. Bd. Oct. 29, 2009) (citing \nAdams v. Laird, 420 F.2d 230, 238-239 (D.C. Cir. 1969)). It is well settled that once a \nconcern arises regarding an applicant\u2019s security clearance eligibility, there is a strong \npresumption against the grant or renewal of a security clearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, \n913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th Cir. 1990). Under Appeal Board precedent, an applicant who \nwaits to address tax issues until his or her immediate interests are at stake does not show \nsound judgment and reliability. His eleventh-hour rectification of his tax filings is too recent \nto create a track record of reasonable assurances that he can be counted on to comply \nwith tax filing deadlines in the future. His failure to give priority to such an important \nobligation as filing tax returns required by law causes lingering doubt about his security \nworthiness that has not been fully mitigated. \n\n11 \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.b: \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances, it not is clearly consistent with the national \ninterest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance. Eligibility for \naccess to classified information is denied. \n \n \n_____________________ \nElizabeth M. Matchinski \nAdministrative Judge \n",

Eligibility for access to \nclassified information is granted.   \n  \nStatement of the Case \n  \nOn January 22, 2018, the Department of Defense (DOD) issued a Statement of \nReasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing security concerns under Guideline B, foreign \ninfluence. Applicant responded to the SOR on February 1, 2018, and requested a hearing \nbefore an administrative judge. The case was assigned to me on January 16, 2019. The \nhearing was convened as scheduled on May 15, 2019.   \n  \nEvidence  \n  \nGovernment Exhibits (GE) 1 through 4 were admitted in evidence without \nobjection. Applicant testified, presented the testimony of two witnesses, and submitted \nApplicant\u2019s Exhibits (AE) A through D, which were admitted without objection.  \n \n\n  \n2  \n  \nDepartment Counsel requested that I take administrative notice of certain facts \nabout Ukraine. Without objection, I have taken administrative notice of the facts contained \nin the request. The facts are summarized in the written request and will not be repeated \nverbatim in this decision. Of particular note is the Russian forces\u2019 occupation of the \nCrimean Peninsula, the ongoing armed conflict between Russia and Ukraine, and the \nongoing arbitrary detentions and human rights abuses from both sides related to the \narmed conflict. The Ukrainian government has failed to take adequate steps to prosecute \nor punish officials engaged in human rights violations and abuses.  \n  \nFindings of Fact  \n  \nApplicant is a 37-year-old employee of a defense contractor. She has worked for \nher current employer since 2015. She graduated from a U.S. high school in 1999; \ncompleted an associate\u2019s degree in 2002; received a bachelor\u2019s degree in 2004; and she \ncompleted a master\u2019s degree in 2006 and a master\u2019s in business administration (MBA) in \n2010. She has been married and divorced twice, and has a six-year-old daughter born in \nthe United States.  \n  \nApplicant was born in Ukraine to Ukrainian parents. She entered the United States \nin 1995 with her parents at age 14. Her father worked for the Ukrainian government in the \nUnited States where he held a sensitive leadership position until he retired in 1999. Upon \nthe completion of her father\u2019s tour in the United States, Applicant\u2019s parents returned to \nUkraine. She stayed in the United States living with high school teachers until she became \n18. After that, she supported herself by working two full-time jobs while attending school \nat night. She became a naturalized U.S. citizen in 2007, and renounced her Ukrainian \ncitizenship.  \n \nApplicant stayed in the United States because she believed in the American ideas \nof freedom, liberty, and the many opportunities offered in the United States that enticed \nher. She believed that there would be a better chance of having a future here in the United \nStates than in Ukraine. She loves the American dream and all the things that are here \nthat are just so different to those in Ukraine. She testified:  \n \nI love this country because this is the only country, as far as I know, in the \nworld that you could be without any support and by working you could \nactually achieve something. You could have an independent life and that's \njust not possible, not possible in Ukraine . . . I really hope like the whole \nworld will become one day, you know, part of the United States because it's \njust the freedom of minds, the freedom of speech, the, you know, just being \nnobody and, achieving, like working and, you know, have a life like that. (Tr. \n39-41) \n \nApplicant testified that when her parents left the United States, they did not have \nany money to provide her with any financial support. She believes they thought she would \n\n  \n3  \n  \nhave the Ukrainian government return her home in a week. However, Applicant stayed \nand since then, she has not had a lot of contact with her parents. Initially, she just had \ntelephonic contact, and now she uses computer programs for face-to-face communication \nso she could actually see and talk with her mother. \n \nApplicant\u2019s father and mother are both in their 70s. Her parents and her half-\nbrother are resident-citizens of Ukraine. According to Applicant, her father has not worked \nafter he retired in 1999. He receives a pension from the Ukrainian government, but \notherwise he has no contact with the Ukrainian government or its military services. \nApplicant has contact with her father once a month. Applicant\u2019s mother was a professor \nat a Ukrainian university. She currently works as an English tutor. Her mother is having \nmedical problems. She was treated for cancer during her stay in the United States (1995-\n1998) and recently had a delicate operation in her country. Applicant communicates with \nher mother about four times a week via electronic means. Her mother visited Applicant in \nthe United States four times: when she got married, when her daughter was born, when \nshe divorced, and on another occasion. According to Applicant, her parents are now \naware she works in a national security position.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s half-brother is married with children. He is a systems engineer for a \nprivate company in Ukraine. They have electronic contact once a month. Between 2002 \nand 2012, Applicant provided around $5,000 to $6,000 in financial assistance to her \nparents and brother. After the birth of her daughter and due to other financial obligations, \nshe has not provided any financial support to her family in Ukraine. Applicant has no \nproperty of financial interests in Ukraine. She believes that because she renounced her \ncitizenship, she has no right to inherit from her parents and the inheritance will go to her \nbrother. \n \nApplicant travelled to Ukraine to visit her family in 2003, 2005, and 2007 using her \nUkrainian passport. She received her U.S. passport in 2007-2008 and used it to travel to \nUkraine in 2009, 2010, and 2014. When she travels, she stays with her family in Ukraine \nfor about 20 days. She does not travel frequently because it takes too long to get to her \nparents\u2019 home and she does not want it to interfere with her job. \n \n \nIn 1999, Applicant received an internship from a U.S. agency, and later she was \nhired as a consultant and granted a clearance. She worked for this agency until 2001. \nShe also was granted a clearance by two other U.S. Government agencies in 2007 and \nin 2010. \n \nApplicant presented four references, two testified and two submitted statements. \nIn general, Applicant is considered to be a good American who is trustworthy, a hard-\nworking single mother who is goal oriented, kind to her daughter, and a caring friend. (AE \n1 and 2; Tr. 21-26) A vice-president (VP) at the corporation where Applicant works \nprovided favorable testimony. He has 23 years of military service experience highlighted \nby his work as a senior service executive at a U.S. command, and as chief of a contracting \n\n  \n4  \n  \noffice for a military service. He met Applicant in 2014 when he interviewed her for her \ncurrent position and they have become friends. He closely supervised Applicant from \nearly 2015 until November 2018, when he was promoted to his current position.  \n \nThe VP believes Applicant is a trustworthy person. She is open, upfront, and \nhonest in her dealings with other people. In his opinion, Applicant is very loyal to the \ncountry that she has adopted and calls her home now. He has no reservations about her \nmaintaining her clearances. (Tr. 30-37) \n \nPolicies  \n  \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG), which became \neffective on June 8, 2017.  \n  \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.  \n  \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in conjunction \nwith the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision.  \n  \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d   \n  \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.   \n  \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \n\n  \n5  \n  \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation of potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information.  \n  \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information).   \n  \nAnalysis  \n  \nGuideline B, Foreign Influence  \n  \n \nThe security concern for foreign influence is set out in AG \u00b6 6:  \n  \nForeign contacts and interests, including, but not limited to, business, \nfinancial, and property interests, are a national security concern if they result \nin divided allegiance. They may also be a national security concern if they \ncreate circumstances in which the individual may be manipulated or induced \nto help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a way \ninconsistent with U.S. interests or otherwise made vulnerable to pressure \nor coercion by any foreign interest. Assessment of foreign contacts and \ninterests should consider the country in which the foreign contact or interest \nis located, including, but not limited to, considerations such as whether it is \nknown to target U.S. citizens to obtain classified or sensitive information or \nis associated with a risk of terrorism.  \n  \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 7. The following are potentially applicable in this case:    \n  \n(a) contact, regardless of method, with a foreign family member, business \nor professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or \nresident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of \nforeign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; and  \n  \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual's obligation to \nprotect classified or sensitive information or technology and the individual\u2019s \ndesire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing that \ninformation or technology.  \n \n\n  \n6  \n  \nThe nature of a nation\u2019s government, its relationship with the United States, and \nits human rights record are relevant in assessing the likelihood that an applicant\u2019s family \nmembers are vulnerable to government coercion. The risk of coercion, persuasion, or \nduress is significantly greater if the foreign country has an authoritarian government, a \nfamily member is associated with or dependent upon the government, the country is \nknown to conduct intelligence operations against the United States, or the foreign country \nis associated with a risk of terrorism.  \n \nThere is a significant threat of terror and ongoing human rights problems in Ukraine \ncompounded by Russia\u2019s invasion and military occupation of sections of Ukraine, and \ntheir ongoing armed conflict. Applicant\u2019s foreign contacts create a potential conflict of \ninterest and a heightened risk of foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, \nand coercion.  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s parents and her half-brother are citizens and residents of Ukraine. \nThere is potential for state or terrorist violence against U.S. interests and citizens in \nUkraine, and the country has human rights problems. Applicant\u2019s foreign contacts create \na potential conflict of interest and a heightened risk of foreign exploitation, inducement, \nmanipulation, pressure, and coercion. The above disqualifying conditions have been \nraised by the evidence.   \n  \n \nConditions that could mitigate foreign influence security concerns are provided \nunder AG \u00b6 8. The following are potentially applicable:   \n(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in which \nthese persons are located, or the positions or activities of those persons in \nthat country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be placed in a \nposition of having to choose between the interests of a foreign individual, \ngroup, organization, or government and the interests of the United States; \nand \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of \nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, or allegiance to the group, \ngovernment, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such deep and \nlongstanding relationships and loyalties in the United States, that the \nindividual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the \nU.S. interest.  \n \nI considered the totality of Applicant\u2019s family ties to the Ukraine as well as each \nindividual family tie. Guideline B is not limited to countries hostile to the United States. \nThe United States has a compelling interest in protecting and safeguarding classified \ninformation from any person, organization, or country that is not authorized to have \naccess to it, regardless of whether that person, organization, or country has interests \ninimical to those of the United States. \n\n  \n7  \n  \n \nThe distinctions between friendly and unfriendly governments must be made with \ncaution. Relations between nations can shift, sometimes dramatically and unexpectedly. \nFurthermore, friendly nations can have profound disagreements with the United States \nover matters they view as important to their vital interests or national security. Finally, we \nknow friendly nations have engaged in espionage against the United States, especially in \nthe economic, scientific, and technical fields.  \n \n \nThe nature of a nation\u2019s government, its relationship with the United States, and \nits human rights record are relevant in assessing the likelihood that an applicant\u2019s family \nmembers are vulnerable to government coercion. The risk of coercion, persuasion, or \nduress is significantly greater if the foreign country has an authoritarian government, a \nfamily member is associated with or dependent upon the government, the country is \nknown to conduct intelligence operations against the United States, or the foreign country \nis associated with a risk of terrorism. I considered that Applicant\u2019s father held a sensitive \nposition in the Ukrainian government. However, that was close to 20 years ago. He retired \nwhen he left the United States, and did not maintain any connections with the Ukrainian \ngovernment or military forces. \n \n \nApplicant is a loyal U.S. citizen. At age 17, she left her parents and stayed in the \nUnited States when they returned to Ukraine. She followed the American dream of \nfreedom and achieving success through hard work and dedication. She has accomplished \nher dream. She is a well-educated woman who is successful in her job and as an \nAmerican. She has a child born in the United States and has immersed herself in the \nculture of the United States. She accomplished her dream on her own, without any \nsupport from her parents or family in Ukraine. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s ties to Ukraine are outweighed by her deep and long-standing \nrelationships and loyalties in the United States. I find that it is unlikely Applicant will be \nplaced in a position of having to choose between the interests of the United States and \nthe interests of Ukraine. Moreover, even if that was the case, Applicant\u2019s actions since \n1999 demonstrate that there would be no conflict of interest because she can be expected \nto resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the United States. AG \u00b6\u00b6 8(a) and 8(b) are \napplicable. \n \nWhole-Person Concept  \n  \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):   \n \n(1) The nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \n\n  \n8  \n  \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guideline B in my whole-person analysis.   \n  \nAt age 17, Applicant decided to stay in the United States when her parents returned \nto Ukraine. She educated herself and has become a productive U.S. citizen. She is now \n37, has a six-year-old daughter, and has established deep and long-standing \nrelationships and loyalties in the United States. Overall, the record evidence leaves me \nwithout questions or doubts about Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security \nclearance. I conclude Applicant mitigated the foreign influence security concerns.   \n \nFormal Findings  \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:  \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline B:   \n  \nFor Applicant  \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.c:  \n  \n  \nFor Applicant  \n \nConclusion \n \nIt is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \n \n \n \n________________________  \nJUAN J. RIVERA  \nAdministrative Judge  \n",

Cervi, Administrative Judge \nThis case involves security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial \nConsiderations). Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nStatement of the Case \nApplicant submitted a security clearance application (SCA) on June 14, 2016. On \nMarch 16, 2018, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications Facility (DOD \nCAF) sent him a statement of reasons (SOR) alleging security concerns under Guideline \nF.1 Applicant answered the SOR and requested a hearing.\nThe case was assigned to me on August 1, 2018. The Defense Office of Hearings \nand Appeals (DOHA) issued a notice of hearing on August 1, 2018, scheduling the \n1 The DOD CAF acted under Executive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \nIndustry (February 20, 1960), as amended; and DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel \nSecurity Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive). The Adjudicative \nGuidelines (AG) were revised effective June 8, 2017, and apply herein. \n02/06/2019\n\n \n2 \n \nhearing for August 30, 2018. The hearing was convened as scheduled. Government \nExhibits (GE) 1 through 4 were admitted in evidence without objection. Applicant testified, \nand Applicant Exhibits (AE) A through D were admitted without objection. Post hearing, \nsupplemental Applicant exhibits AE E through G were offered in evidence and were \nadmitted without objection. DOHA received the hearing transcript (Tr.) on September 10, \n2018. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant is a 55-year-old senior electrical engineer, employed by a defense \ncontractor since 1986. He married in 1987 and separated in July 2015. He shares custody \nof two children, 18 and 14 years old. He currently holds a top secret security clearance. \n \nThe SOR alleges Applicant is delinquent on seven consumer debts totaling \napproximately $30,500; failed to file Federal tax returns for 2013, 2014, 2016 and 2017; \nand is delinquent on approximately $13,137 in Federal income taxes for tax years 2015 \nand 2016. The SOR allegations are supported by substantial evidence. In his Answer to \nthe SOR, Applicant admitted the allegations except he disputed the amount owed in SOR \n\u00b6 1.a, and noted that he filed his 2013 and 2014 tax returns, but he had not filed his 2016 \nand 2017 tax returns as alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.h. \n \nApplicant separated from his spouse, moved from the house, and filed for divorce \nbut never completed the process due to attorney costs. He paid about $5,000 in attorney \nfees in 2015 and 2016. Marital debts were not divided, but a temporary order was filed in \n2015 regarding the parties\u2019 rights and obligations with respect to the children. Applicant \npays child and spouse support totaling about $2,400 per month, and he pays his spouse\u2019s \nhome utilities and insurance costs. He began to accumulate debts in 2015 and 2016 due \nto the costs of separation and divorce proceedings. In 2018, Applicant borrowed about \n$40,000 from his 401k retirement plan. The home occupied by his spouse is paid, and he \nis renting a home for himself. Applicant disclosed that he is delinquent on debts not listed \nin the SOR, and is paying on two auto loans, including his spouse\u2019s car. \n \nApplicant testified that he filed his 2014 and 2015 taxes when due, but did not file \nthe 2016 or 2017 returns on time because he did not have sufficient income to pay the \ntaxes owed.2 When he started to file tax returns as a single filer, his tax liability \nsubstantially increased. After the hearing, Applicant submitted a letter from the IRS \naccepting his offer to pay his 2015 and 2016 tax arrearage of $6,053, by December 22, \n2018. However, at the hearing, Applicant was unsure of how he could raise sufficient \nfunds to pay the tax arrearage. He stated that he has about $1,500 net remainder each \nmonth, but \u201csomething always comes up.\u201d He noted he had about $150 in his checking \nand savings accounts. No evidence of final satisfaction of the tax debt was provided. \n \n                                                     \n2 Applicant testified that he has already paid about $36,000 in 2018, to cover taxes owed for 2016 and \n2017. AE C shows IRS transcripts showing payments of $24,681 with Applicant\u2019s 2016 and 2017 tax \nreturns. The 2016 return was filed in May 2018, and the 2017 return was filed on time in April 2018. \n\n \n3 \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.a is a 2017 judgment owed to a credit card company for $10,861. \nApplicant agreed to a post-judgment settlement to pay a total of $5,000 in monthly \npayments beginning in September 2017. At the hearing, Applicant stated that he hired an \nattorney to settle the debt and to work on other delinquent debts. Applicant agreed to pay \n$416 per month until August 2018, but at the hearing, he stated that he was late in making \npayments and was behind about $2,500. No evidence of final satisfaction of the debt has \nbeen provided. Applicant testified that consumer debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b\u20131.g have \nnot been resolved, but he intended to ask his attorney to work with the creditors. Post \nhearing, Applicant provided a letter from his attorney, indicating that she proposed waiting \nfor lawsuits before settling debts, but that she could pursue them prior to litigation if \nApplicant preferred. No evidence of substantial progress toward resolution of the debts \nhas been provided. \n \nApplicant described himself as a mentor at his employment who started new \ninitiatives. Applicant has not sought financial counseling. \n \nLaw and Policies \n \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 2. \n \nNational security eligibility is predicated upon the applicant meeting the criteria \ncontained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. \nInstead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge applies \nthese guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative \njudge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider a person\u2019s stability, trustworthiness, reliability, \ndiscretion, character, honesty, and judgment. AG \u00b6 1(b). \n \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865  \n\u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \n\n \n4 \n \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \n \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \u201cSubstantial \nevidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. Washington \nMetro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines presume a \nnexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria listed \ntherein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 12-01295 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Jan. 20, 2015). \n \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, \nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. \n02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \n \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01- \n20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see, AG \u00b6 1(d). \n \nAnalysis \n \nFinancial Considerations \n \nThe security concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \n \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. . . .  \n \nThe relevant disqualifying conditions under AG \u00b6 19 include: \n \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \n \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired. \n \n \n\n \n5 \n \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s admissions and the documentary evidence in the record supporting the \nSOR allegations are sufficient to establish the disqualifying conditions above. \n \nThe following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially relevant: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue; and \n \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority \nto file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \n \nApplicant suffered a financial setback after separating from his spouse. His debts \nare long-standing and Applicant has not acted responsibly under the circumstances to \nadequately address his debts, especially before his security clearance hearing. He has \nbeen generally unable to pay or resolve delinquent debts listed in the SOR, and additional \ndebts not listed have become delinquent. In addition, he failed to file his 2016 Federal tax \nreturn when due, and owes Federal taxes for 2015 and 2016.  \n \nApplicant hired an attorney to negotiate a settlement on a judgment from a credit \ncard company, but failed to comply with the terms and has not shown that the debt is \nresolved. He has also asked his attorney for assistance with the remaining SOR debts, \nbut has not followed-up on significant and conclusive actions to resolve them. Prior to his \nhearing, Applicant submitted an offer to pay his Federal tax debt by the end of 2018. The \n\n \n6 \n \noffer was accepted by the IRS in August 2018, but Applicant testified that he was unlikely \nable to pay the debt, and has not offered evidence that the debt was satisfied. \n \nApplicant\u2019s financial status was clearly impacted by his marital problems beginning \nin 2015, however he has not shown that his financial situation is unlikely to recur, or that \nhe has initiated good-faith efforts to repay his creditors or resolve his debts. I am not \nconvinced that Applicant has an effective plan to regain control of his finances. He has \nnot sought financial counseling to effectively budget his financial future, and he has not \nshown an ability, intent, or willingness to significantly address his delinquent debts in a \ntimely manner. \n \nOverall, I find that Applicant has a history of financial distress, and has not \nadequately addressed his financial and tax obligations, nor has he shown the level of \nfinancial responsibility expected of individuals holding security eligibility. I find that his \nfinancial status is not under control and, and that similar problems may recur given the \nfinancial course he is on. AG \u00b6\u00b6 20 (b) and (g) are partially applicable but these and the \nremaining mitigating conditions are not sufficient to overcome the concerns raised by his \nhistory of financial issues and current status. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6\u00b6 2(a), 2(c), and 2(d), the ultimate determination of whether to grant \nnational security eligibility must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. Under the whole-person \nconcept, the administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security \nclearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process \nfactors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d).3 Although adverse information concerning a single criterion \nmay not be sufficient for an unfavorable eligibility determination, the individual may be \nfound ineligible if available information reflects a recent or recurring pattern of \nquestionable judgment, irresponsibility, or unstable behavior. AG \u00b6 2(e). \n \nI considered all of the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of \nall the facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my findings of \nfact and comments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. Applicant\u2019s marital \nissues, additional financial obligations, and long-standing employment and security \neligibility are noted, however, they do not overcome his unresolved financial and tax \ndelinquencies, inability to adequately address his debts over the last three years, and \nexhibited history of financial distress. \n \n                                                     \n3 (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to \ninclude knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age \nand maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence \nor absence of rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or \nrecurrence. \n\n \n7 \n \nAccordingly, I conclude Applicant has not carried his burden of showing that it is \nclearly consistent with the national security interests of the United States to grant him \neligibility for access to classified information. \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a to 1.i:   \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national security interests of the \nUnited States to grant Applicant eligibility for access to classified information.

His answer to \nthe SOR included eight exhibits (SOR Exhibits A through H). \n \n \nApplicant is a 55-year-old self-employed owner and president of a federal \ncontractor that provides recovery, screening, and sanitizing of discarded information-\ntechnology (IT) materials. He has owned and operated the company since September \n2009. He was a self-employed truck driver from March 2007 to September 2009 and a \ndriver for a landscaping company from April 2005 to March 2007.  \n \n \nApplicant married in February 1986, divorced in February 1999, and married his \ncurrent spouse in February 2000. He graduated from high school and completed one \nsemester of college. He has four adult children and two adult stepchildren. His son, a \nNavy veteran, is a co-owner of his business and its facility security officer. (SOR Exhibit \nH at 1.) \n \nApplicant received a security clearance in October 2013. He submitted his most \nrecent SCA to obtain eligibility for access to sensitive compartmented information (SCI). \nHis application was denied in October 2015. (GX 2.) \n \n \nAt the hearing, Applicant testified that, for several years before 2006, he and his \nwife were focused on parenting and \u201creally weren\u2019t much of a couple.\u201d In 2006, he \nseriously injured his neck and back while in heavy surf at the beach. His wife had urged \nhim not to go into the water, but he did not comply with her urging. He spent about three \nmonths wearing a \u201chalo,\u201d which immobilized his head and neck, followed by a cervical \ncollar for about four weeks. (SOR Exhibit C.) During his recovery period after he was \ninjured, his wife informed him that there would be no more sexual intimacy between \nthem. Neither spouse wanted a divorce, because it would tear apart the family. At the \n                                                          \n1 Applicant\u2019s personal information is extracted from his security clearance application (GX 1) unless \notherwise indicated by a parenthetical citation to the record. \n\n \n3 \n \ntime, Applicant\u2019s children were 21, 20, 17, and 13 years old. (Tr. 50-55.) He told a \nclinical psychologist that his choices were \u201cleave the marriage and break up the family, \nor go without sex, or find sex elsewhere.\u201d (AX C at 7.) \n \nNear the end of 2006, Applicant was driving a truck far from home and \nexperiencing persistent neck and back pain. He stopped at a massage parlor, and at the \nend of the massage he unexpectedly received a \u201chappy ending,\u201d by having his genitals \nmassaged to the point of orgasm. He repeated his experience about every two months. \nHis genitals were usually massaged manually and sometimes orally. He had sexual \nintercourse on two occasions. He did not feel that oral or manual stimulation was wrong, \nbut he was uncomfortable with intercourse, and he did not return to the places where \nintercourse occurred. In each case, when he received sexual services, he had not \nspecifically requested them but did not stop them. (Tr. 63.) He recognized that the \nexperience was illegal in some of the places he visited. (Tr. 56-57.)  \n \nIn the late 1990s Applicant began shoplifting food items at highway rest stops. \nHe believed that food items were \u201cludicrously overpriced,\u201d and he felt that he was \u2018being \nripped off.\u201d To compensate for the overpricing, he would take two food items but pay for \nonly one. During the years he was shoplifting, he estimated that the total value of items \ntaken was less than $100. (Tr. 59-61.) \n \nApplicant testified that in October 2014, during the interviews involved in the \nadjudication of his SCI application, he suddenly realized the seriousness and gravity of \nhis conduct. (Tr. 66.) When he went home after the interviews in which he disclosed his \nbehavior, he disclosed everything to his wife. He testified, \u201cI recognized that as painful \nof a conversation as that would be, there\u2019d be no way that I could hold a position of trust \nif I didn\u2019t do that.\u201d (Tr. 67.) His wife has forgiven him and they have become very close, \nto the extent that they communicate several times a day, even when they are \ngeographically separated. He disclosed his conduct to a close business associate and \nhis former director of security. (Tr. 70.) \n \nApplicant has not disclosed his conduct to his children, because he and his wife \nhave agreed to keep the matter as private as possible. He testified that if someone \nthreatened to disclose his conduct to his children, he would immediately notify the \nappropriate authorities, and then gather the family and fully disclose what he had done. \nHe recognizes that the children would be hurt and might not speak to him. He testified, \n\u201cMy children love me, and I love them. We would get through that without any real \ntearing the family apart, so to speak.\u201d (Tr. 85-86.)  \n \nAfter the unfavorable adjudication of his application for SCI eligibility, Applicant \nchanged his lifestyle. He had been grossly overweight, and he lost 100 pounds. He, \nstopped smoking after 37 years, and became involved in community activities. Most \nimportantly, he and his wife resumed the close and affectionate relationship that they \nenjoyed when they first married. (Tr. 71-72.) Applicant\u2019s wife submitted a statement \naffirming that she and Applicant are still in love and moving forward with their lives. She \nstated that Applicant is \u201cdoing everything in his power to atone for his prior sins.\u201d She \n\n \n4 \n \nand Applicant agreed that her personal testimony would be emotionally \u201cfar too hard.\u201d \nShe explained, \u201cWe have gone through the darkest of our times together and made it \nout to the light, but it still hurts to have to speak publicly about our dark times, and \nwriting this letter is by far easier.\u201d (AX B.) \n \nApplicant obtained outpatient psychotherapy from a licensed clinical psychologist \n(LCSW) three or four times a month from August 2015 to June 2017. He was diagnosed \nwith Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), and his treatment focused on \nmanaging his hyperactivity. (SOR Exhibit E at 1.) He has been treated two or three \ntimes a month by another LCSW from July 2017 to the present. The focus is still on \nmanaging his impulsivity. The second LCSW states that Applicant \u201chas made \nconsiderable progress in his ability to regulate his impulses, and as long as he \ncontinues to maintain this progress, his prognosis is good.\u201d (SOR Exhibit E at 2.) A \npsychological evaluation conducted in April 2018 by a third LCSW found Applicant free \nfrom major psychological difficulties and histrionic personality traits. This LCSW\u2019s \nobservations and comments included the following: \n \nThe testing suggests that [Applicant] has periods of anxiety and that he \nmay be somewhat intolerant of other\u2019s shortcomings or failings. He reports \nfeeling strong aggressive and sexual drives and he is highly sensitive to \nrejection. . . . He may feel slighted if he is not receiving what he wants \nfrom a relationship. . . .  \n \nHe has periods where he feels self-remorse and low self-esteem \ncharacterized by not feeling that he is \u201cas good\u201d as others. He may try to \nprotect himself in relationships by detaching himself, which fits with his \nreported history of difficulty with emotional and physical intimacy. This also \nhelps \nexplain \nhow \nhe \nsought \ngratification \nthrough \nanonymous \nrelationships that do not require emotions or commitment. These \ntendencies are not likely to impact on employment matters but affect his \ninterpersonal relationships and his private life. These issues are also not \ninflexible and can be moderated, particularly since he is involved in \ncounseling and aware of them. . . .  \n \nIndividuals with these personality tendencies may have some struggle with \ntheir closest relationships and intimacy but are inclined to excel \nprofessionally in their occupational setting where they are able to fulfil their \naffiliative needs and find positive reinforcement for their behavior. They \nare often found to be hard working, reliable, dedicated and highly \nproductive individuals due to these factors. . . . \n \n[Applicant\u2019s] focal behavioral lapses of the past appear to be anomalies \nbased on unusual circumstances that are not likely to happen again and \nthat do not represent his normal behavior. These issues are now well \nunderstood and have ceased. There is no indication that this illicit \n\n \n5 \n \nbehavior will ever reoccur, and he appears to be capable of holding a \nposition of trust as he has successfully done for years prior. \n \n(AX C; AX D.) \n \nApplicant began neurofeedback treatment in June 2017 to help him control his \nimpulsivity. (Tr. 73.) His neurofeedback counselor submitted the following comments: \n \nIn my experience with [Applicant], he has consistently presented himself \nas a forthright, honest individual with an excellent work ethic and high \npersonal integrity. He has a high level of self-awareness and personal \ninsight and has been able to provide honest, comprehensive self-reports \nof functioning and reactions to training. . . . Neurofeedback has helped \n[Applicant] with increased self-awareness and control and maintenance \nof an appropriate level of psychophysiological arousal that maximizes \nattention, focus, working memory and executive functioning capabilities. \n \n(AX E.) \n \nApplicant testified that he did not make his lifestyle changes to enable him to \nreceive a clearance; he made the changes because going through the adjudication \nprocess put him in touch with \u201chow awful [he] was.\u201d He testified: \u201cInside was awful, and I \nneed to fix that. It was a catalyst, if you will, but no, I didn\u2019t become a better person to \nget a clearance. I want to be a person who\u2019s worthy of a clearance, with or without the \nclearance.\u201d (Tr. 78.) He submitted a \u201cStatement of Intent\u201d agreeing to revocation of any \nsecurity clearance if he engages in shoplifting or receives the services of prostitutes in \nthe future. (AX A.) \n \n \nA defense contractor who relied on Applicant as a subcontractor for many years \ntestified that he regarded Applicant as a \u201cvalued partner,\u201d who was very competent, \nmeticulous, and dedicated. Applicant disclosed his sexual conduct and shoplifting to this \ndefense contractor, who was surprised but would not hesitate to work with him again. \n(Tr. 22-28.) The defense contractor\u2019s facility security officer was especially impressed \nwith Applicant\u2019s meticulous attention and aggressive responses to potential spillages \nfrom IT hardware. (SOR Exhibit H at 8; AX F.) A former co-worker regards Applicant as \nextremely security conscious, dedicated, and knowledgeable. (SOR Exhibit H at 3.) \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s 33-year-old stepson admires him for teaching him the value of hard \nwork and the importance of family and friends. (SOR Exhibit H at 2.) His 25-year-old \nstepson remembers him as a loving and caring father-figure, extremely generous, \ntalented, and a great leader. (SOR Exhibit H at 5.) \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s 29-year-old daughter describes him as extremely patriotic, honest, \nand hard-working. She admires him for teaching her the value of hard work, teamwork, \nhonesty, and time management. (SOR Exhibit H at 4.) His 25-year-old daughter \nremembers how Applicant taught her about honesty and hard work. She describes him \n\n \n6 \n \nas \u201can amazing father, friendly neighbor, caring friend, loving husband, and most \nimportantly, a patriot.\u201d (SOR Exhibit H at 6. \n \nPolicies \n \n \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 2.  \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge \napplies these guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \n \n \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec. Or. \n10865 \u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the \napplicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense \nhave established for issuing a clearance. \n \n \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in \nthe personal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant \nfrom being eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden \nof establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the \ncriteria listed therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 15-\n01253 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr.20, 2016).   \n \n\n \n7 \n \n \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, \nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-\n31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).  \n \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. \n01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, \nif they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline D, Sexual Behavior \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.a alleges that, from approximately 2006 to approximately 2014, \nApplicant paid money for sexual gratification. The concern under this guideline is set out \nin AG 12:  \n \nSexual behavior that involves a criminal offense; reflects a lack of \njudgment or discretion; or may subject the individual to undue influence of \ncoercion, exploitation, or duress. These issues, together or individually, \nmay \nraise \nquestions \nabout \nan \nindividual's \njudgment, \nreliability, \ntrustworthiness, and ability to protect classified or sensitive information. \nSexual behavior includes conduct occurring in person or via audio, visual, \nelectronic, or written transmission. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s admissions establish the following disqualifying conditions under this \nguideline: \n \nAG \u00b6 13(a): sexual behavior of a criminal nature, whether or not the \nindividual has been prosecuted; \n \nAG \u00b6 13(b): a pattern of compulsive, self-destructive, or high-risk sexual \nbehavior that the individual is unable to stop; and \n \nAG \u00b6 13(c): sexual behavior that causes an individual to be vulnerable to \ncoercion, exploitation, or duress. \n \nThe following mitigating conditions are potentially applicable: \n \nAG \u00b6 14(b): the sexual behavior happened so long ago, so infrequently, or \nunder such unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur and does not \ncast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or \njudgment; \n \n\n \n8 \n \nAG \u00b6 14(c): the behavior no longer serves as a basis for coercion, \nexploitation, or duress; \n \nAG \u00b6 14(d): the sexual behavior is strictly private, consensual, and \ndiscreet; and \n \nAG \u00b6 14(e): the individual has successfully completed an appropriate \nprogram of treatment, or is currently enrolled in one, has demonstrated \nongoing and consistent compliance with the treatment plan, and/or has \nreceived a favorable prognosis from a qualified mental health professional \nindicating the behavior is readily controllable with treatment. \n \n \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 14(b) and 14(e) are established. Applicant\u2019s sexual misbehavior and petty \ntheft stopped more than four years ago. His debilitating and painful injury, followed by \nhis wife\u2019s termination of marital intimacy, were unusual circumstances that left him \nfeeling angry and rejected. He now understands what contributed to his conduct and \nhas obtained counseling to deal with it. The medical professionals who have assisted \nhim believe that recurrence is unlikely. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 14(c) is not fully established. Applicant has disclosed his conduct to his \nwife, but not to his children and stepchildren. Thus, he remains vulnerable to coercion, \nexploitation, or duress. However, he found the courage to disclose his misconduct to his \nwife and a close business associate, and I am confident that he will muster the strength \nto disclose his misconduct to his children and stepchildren if necessary. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 14(d) is not established. Applicant visited the massage parlors alone, and \nhis sexual activity was private and consensual, but it was not discreet. \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 2.a alleges that Applicant engaged in shoplifting for about 35-40 years \nuntil 2014. SOR \u00b6 2.b cross-alleges SOR \u00b6 1.a. \n \nThe concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 15: \u201cConduct involving \nquestionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules \nand regulations can raise questions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and \nability to protect classified or sensitive information. . . .\u201d \n \nApplicant\u2019s admissions establish the following disqualifying conditions under this \nguideline: \nAG \u00b6 16(c): credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue \nareas that is not sufficient for an adverse determination under any other \nsingle guideline, but which, when considered as a whole, supports a \nwhole-person assessment of questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, \nunreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and \n\n \n9 \n \nregulations, or other characteristics indicating that the individual may not \nproperly safeguard classified or sensitive information; \n \nAG \u00b6 16(d): credible adverse information that is not explicitly covered \nunder any other guideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an \nadverse determination, but which, when combined with all available \ninformation, supports a whole-person assessment of questionable \njudgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to \ncomply with rules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that \nthe individual may not properly safeguard classified or sensitive \ninformation. This includes, but is not limited to, consideration of: . . . (2) \nany disruptive, violent, or other inappropriate behavior; [and] (3) a pattern \nof dishonesty or rule violations; . . .  \n \nAG \u00b6 16(e): personal conduct, or concealment of information about one's \nconduct, that creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or \nduress by a foreign intelligence entity or other individual or group. Such \nconduct includes: (1) engaging in activities which, if known, could affect \nthe person's personal, professional, or community standing . . . ; and \n \nAG \u00b6 16(g); association with persons involved in criminal activity. \n \n \nThe following mitigating conditions are potentially applicable: \n \nAG \u00b6 17(c): the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the \nbehavior is so infrequent, or it happened under such unique \ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the \nindividual's reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \nAG \u00b6 17(d): the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained \ncounseling to change the behavior or taken other positive steps to \nalleviate the stressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to \nuntrustworthy, unreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such \nbehavior is unlikely to recur; \n \nAG \u00b6 17(e): the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate \nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress; and \n \nAG \u00b6 17(g): association with persons involved in criminal activities was \nunwitting, has ceased, or occurs under circumstances that do not cast \ndoubt upon the individual's reliability, trustworthiness, judgment, or \nwillingness to comply with rules and regulations. \n \n \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 17(c) and 17(d) are established for the reasons set out in the above \ndiscussion of AG \u00b6\u00b6 14(b) and 14(e). AG \u00b6 17(e) is not fully established for the reasons \n\n \n10 \n \nset out in the above discussion of AG \u00b6 14(c). AG \u00b6 17(g) is established, because \nApplicant no longer visits massage parlors engaged in illegal prostitution. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-\nperson concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances and applying the adjudicative factors in AG \u00b6 2(d).2  \n \n \nI have incorporated my comments under Guidelines D and E in my whole-person \nanalysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were addressed under those guidelines, but \nsome warrant additional comment. Applicant was candid, sincere, remorseful, and \ncredible at the hearing. Before his injury and the disintegration of his marriage in 2006, \nhe held a security clearance without incident. His reconciliation with his wife, her strong \nsupport, and his continuing treatment by medical professionals are major factors making \nrecurrence unlikely. \n \n \nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under Guidelines D and \nE, and evaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude \nApplicant has mitigated the security concerns raised by his sexual behavior and \npersonal conduct. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline D (Sexual Behavior): \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E (Personal Conduct):  \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 2.a and 2.b: \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n                                                          \n2 The factors are: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances \nsurrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the \nconduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which \nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral \nchanges; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \n\n \n11 \n \nConclusion \n \n \nI conclude that it is clearly consistent with the national security interests of the \nUnited States to continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nClearance is granted. \n \n \n \n \nLeRoy F.

Tilford, Esq., Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Ronald C. Sykstus, Esq. \n \n06/13/2019 \n \n______________ \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \n \nLOUGHRAN, Edward W., Administrative Judge: \n \nApplicant mitigated the foreign influence security concerns. Eligibility for access \nto classified information is granted.  \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nOn October 29, 2018, the Department of Defense (DOD) issued a Statement of \nReasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing security concerns under Guideline B, foreign \ninfluence. Applicant responded to the SOR on November 23, 2018, and elected to have \nthe case decided on the written record in lieu of a hearing. On February 4, 2019, he \nchanged his request to a hearing before an administrative judge. The case was \nassigned to me on March 14, 2019. The hearing was convened as scheduled on May 9, \n2019. Department Counsel amended the SOR at the hearing by withdrawing SOR \nparagraphs 1.c and 1.d. \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n2 \n \nEvidence \n \nGovernment Exhibits (GE) 1 and 2 were admitted in evidence without objection. \nApplicant testified, called seven witnesses, and submitted Applicant\u2019s Exhibits (AE) A \nthrough PP, which were admitted without objection. \n \nDepartment Counsel requested that I take administrative notice of certain facts \nabout Egypt. Without objection, I have taken administrative notice of the facts contained \nin the request. The facts are summarized in the written request and will not be repeated \nverbatim in this decision. Applicant submitted additional information about Egypt. (AE X) \nI have also taken administrative notice of facts about Egypt from the U.S. Department of \nState website. Egypt is a republic governed by an elected president and unicameral \nlegislature. The United States and Egypt share a strong partnership based on mutual \ninterest in Middle East peace and stability, economic opportunity, and regional security. \nPromoting a stable, prosperous Egypt, where the government protects the basic rights \nof its citizens and fulfills the aspirations of the Egyptian people, will continue to be a \ncore objective of U.S. policy. I also note the significant threat of terrorism and ongoing \nhuman rights problems in Egypt. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant is a 37-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has worked for \nhis employer or a predecessor company for about 13 years. He is applying for a security \nclearance for the first time. He has a bachelor\u2019s degree and a master\u2019s degree. He is \nmarried with four children. \n \n \nApplicant was born in the United States to Egyptian parents. His father worked \nfor the Egyptian government and was assigned to the United States. Applicant returned \nto Egypt with his family when he was about three years old. He grew up and was \neducated in Egypt, but he often visited the United States and always planned to \neventually move back here. He was hired by a U.S. company after college and worked \nin Egypt until about 2013. His job required him to travel frequently to the United States. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s wife is from Egypt, and they were married in Egypt. Two of their \nchildren were born in Egypt and two were born in the United States. All of their children \nare U.S. citizens. Applicant moved his family to the United States in 2011. From 2011 to \n2013, he divided his time between Egypt and the United states. He moved permanently \nto the United States in 2013. His wife became a U.S. citizen in 2016. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s father is deceased. His mother, brother, parents-in-law, and two \nsiblings-in-law are citizens and residents of Egypt. His mother is a retired school teacher \nin poor health. His brother works in finance. Applicant\u2019s brother stays with his mother \nand takes care of her. Applicant talks to his mother and brother regularly because he \nwants to check on her. \n \n\n \n3 \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s parent-in-laws are retired with medical conditions. His siblings-in-law \nwork for private companies. Applicant talks to his parents-in-laws about once a month \nwhen his wife talks to them. He talks to his wife\u2019s siblings less often. \n \n \nApplicant owns the apartment in Egypt where he used to live. He estimated its \nvalue at $40,000. It is for sale. He does not have any other assets in Egypt. Applicant \nowns his house in the United States as well as the house next store, which he rents to a \ntenant. He has about $81,000 in a retirement account. He credibly testified that his \nfamily and property in Egypt could not be used to coerce or intimidate him into revealing \nclassified information, and that he would report any attempt to do so. \n \nApplicant is active in his community. He is a volunteer firefighter who was named \nVolunteer Firefighter of the Year in 2015. He started the process to join the National \nGuard in 2017, but when his wife became pregnant, he decided it would require too \nmuch time away from a pregnant wife and three young children. Seven witnesses \ntestified on his behalf, and he submitted numerous documents and letters attesting to \nhis civic involvement, patriotism, honesty, loyalty, strong moral character, and \noutstanding job performance.  \n \nPolicies \n \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG), which became \neffective on June 8, 2017. \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG paragraph 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of \nvariables known as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \nparagraph 2(b) requires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for \nnational security eligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d  \n \n\n \n4 \n \nUnder Directive paragraph E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to \nestablish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive paragraph E3.1.15, the \napplicant is responsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, \nextenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department \nCounsel.\u201d The applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable \nsecurity decision.  \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline B, Foreign Influence \n \n \nThe security concern for foreign influence is set out in AG paragraph 6: \n \nForeign contacts and interests, including, but not limited to, business, \nfinancial, and property interests, are a national security concern if they \nresult in divided allegiance. They may also be a national security concern \nif they create circumstances in which the individual may be manipulated or \ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a \nway inconsistent with U.S. interests or otherwise made vulnerable to \npressure or coercion by any foreign interest. Assessment of foreign \ncontacts and interests should consider the country in which the foreign \ncontact or interest is located, including, but not limited to, considerations \nsuch as whether it is known to target U.S. citizens to obtain classified or \nsensitive information or is associated with a risk of terrorism. \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG paragraph 7. The following are potentially applicable in this case:   \n \n(a) contact, regardless of method, with a foreign family member, business \nor professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or \nresident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of \nforeign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; \n\n \n5 \n \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual's obligation to \nprotect classified or sensitive information or technology and the \nindividual\u2019s desire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing \nthat information or technology;  \n \n(e) shared living quarters with a person or persons, regardless of \ncitizenship status, if that relationship creates a heightened risk of foreign \ninducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; and \n \n(f) substantial business, financial, or property interests in a foreign country, \nor in any foreign owned or foreign-operated business that could subject \nthe individual to a heightened risk of foreign influence or exploitation or \npersonal conflict of interest. \n \nThere is a significant threat of terrorism and ongoing human rights problems in \nEgypt. Applicant\u2019s foreign contacts and property create a potential conflict of interest \nand a heightened risk of foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, and \ncoercion, both directly and through his wife. The above disqualifying conditions have \nbeen raised by the evidence.  \n \nConditions that could mitigate foreign influence security concerns are provided \nunder AG paragraph 8. The following are potentially applicable:  \n(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in \nwhich these persons are located, or the positions or activities of those \npersons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be \nplaced in a position of having to choose between the interests of a foreign \nindividual, group, organization, or government and the interests of the \nUnited States;  \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of \nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, or allegiance to the group, \ngovernment, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such deep and \nlongstanding relationships and loyalties in the United States, that the \nindividual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the \nU.S. interest; and \n(f) the value or routine nature of the foreign business, financial, or property \ninterests is such that they are unlikely to result in a conflict and could not \nbe used effectively to influence, manipulate, or pressure the individual. \n \nI considered the totality of Applicant\u2019s ties to Egypt. Egypt is a republic governed \nby an elected president and unicameral legislature. The United States and Egypt share \na strong partnership based on mutual interest in Middle East peace and stability, \neconomic opportunity, and regional security. Guideline B is not limited to countries \nhostile to the United States. The United States has a compelling interest in protecting \n\n \n6 \n \nand safeguarding classified information from any person, organization, or country that is \nnot authorized to have access to it, regardless of whether that person, organization, or \ncountry has interests inimical to those of the United States. \n \n \nThe distinctions between friendly and unfriendly governments must be made \nwith caution. Relations between nations can shift, sometimes dramatically and \nunexpectedly. Furthermore, friendly nations can have profound disagreements with the \nUnited States over matters they view as important to their vital interests or national \nsecurity. Finally, we know friendly nations have engaged in espionage against the \nUnited States, especially in the economic, scientific, and technical fields. The nature of \na nation\u2019s government, its relationship with the United States, and its human rights \nrecord are relevant in assessing the likelihood that an applicant\u2019s family members are \nvulnerable to government coercion. The risk of coercion, persuasion, or duress is \nsignificantly greater if the foreign country has an authoritarian government, a family \nmember is associated with or dependent upon the government, the country is known to \nconduct intelligence operations against the United States, or the foreign country is \nassociated with a risk of terrorism.  \n \n \nApplicant is a loyal U.S. citizen. His wife and four children are in the United \nStates and are U.S. citizens. He is a valued employee and a dedicated member of his \ncommunity. He was named Volunteer Firefighter of the Year in 2015. With the exception \nof the apartment in Egypt that is for sale, all of his assets are in the United States.  \nI find that Applicant\u2019s ties to Egypt are outweighed by his deep and long-standing \nrelationships and loyalties in the United States. His closest family, life, home, majority of \nhis assets, and professional career are in the United States. I find that it is unlikely he \nwill be placed in a position of having to choose between the interests of the United \nStates and the interests of Egypt. There is no conflict of interest, because he can be \nexpected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the United States. The above \nmitigating conditions are applicable. \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG paragraph 2(d):  \n \n(1) The nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n\n \n7 \n \n \nUnder AG paragraph 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant \neligibility for a security clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based \nupon careful consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I have \nincorporated my comments under Guideline B in my whole-person analysis. I also \nconsidered Applicant\u2019s strong character evidence. \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude Applicant \nmitigated the foreign influence security concerns.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline B:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.b: \n \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.c-1.d: \n \n \nWithdrawn \nSubparagraphs 1.e-1.f: \n \n \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \n \n \nIt is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \n \n \n \n________________________ \nEdward W. Loughran \nAdministrative Judge \n",

Weber, Esquire \n10/02/2019\n______________ \nDecision \n______________ \nGALES, Robert Robinson, Administrative Judge: \nApplicant mitigated the security concerns regarding psychological conditions. \nEligibility for a security clearance is granted. \nStatement of the Case \nOn December 11, 2012, Applicant applied for a security clearance and submitted \nan Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing (e-QIP) version of a Security \nClearance Application. On January 24, 2018, the Department of Defense (DOD) \nConsolidated Adjudications Facility (CAF) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to him, \nunder Executive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \nIndustry (February 20, 1960), as amended and modified; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense \nIndustrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended \nand modified (Directive); and Directive 4 of the Security Executive Agent (SEAD 4), \nNational Security Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) (December 10, 2016), for all covered \nindividuals who require initial or continued eligibility for access to classified information or \neligibility to hold a sensitive position, effective June 8, 2017. \n\n \n2 \n                                      \n \nThe SOR alleged security concerns under Guideline I (Psychological Conditions), \nand detailed reasons why the DOD adjudicators were unable to find that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant. \nThe SOR recommended referral to an administrative judge to determine whether a \nclearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked.  \n \n \nIn a notarized statement, dated February 20, 2018, Applicant responded to the \nSOR and requested a hearing before an administrative judge. Department Counsel \nindicated the Government was prepared to proceed on April 13, 2018. The case was \nassigned to me on January 10, 2019.  A Notice of Hearing was issued on March 13, 2019. \nI convened the hearing as scheduled on April 2, 2019. \n \n \nDuring the hearing, Government exhibits (GE) 1 through GE 7, and Applicant \nexhibits (AE) A through AE E were admitted into evidence without objection. Applicant \nand four witnesses testified. The transcript (Tr.) was received on April 11, 2019. I kept the \nrecord open to enable Applicant to supplement it. He took advantage of that opportunity \nand timely submitted several documents which were marked and admitted as AE F \nthrough AE Z without objection. The record closed on June 3, 2019. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nIn his Answer to the SOR, Applicant partially admitted, with comments, three of the \nfactual allegations in the SOR (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a. through 1.c.). He denied the remaining \nallegations. Applicant\u2019s admissions and comments are incorporated herein as findings of \nfact.

He has been serving \nas a maintenance control lead with his current employer since February 2010. He \npreviously served as a product handler with a chemical company from March 2008 until \nFebruary 2010. He is a 1996 high school graduate, with some college credits, but no \ndegree. Appellant enlisted in the U.S. Air Force in October 2001, and he served on active \nduty until August 2007, when he was honorably discharged as an airman 1st class (E-3). \nSeveral months before his discharge, Applicant was disciplined by Article 15, Uniform \nCode of Military Justice (UCMJ) for violating a no-contact order with his estranged wife, \nand he was reduced in grade from senior airman (E-4). (AE A; GE 2, at 15-19) Applicant \nwas married in 2001, and divorced in 2008. He remarried in 2008. He has two children, \nborn in 2004 and 2016. He was granted a top secret clearance in 2003.  \n \nMilitary Awards and Decorations \n \n \nDuring his military career, Appellant received the Air Force Achievement Medal, \nAir Force Good Conduct Medal, the National Defense Service Medal, the Global War on \nTerrorism Service Medal, the Air Force Longevity Service Award; the Air Force Training \nRibbon, and the Air Force Outstanding Unit Award. (AE A (Certificate of Release or \nDischarge from Active Duty (DD Form 214)) He was also the recipient of numerous letters \n\n \n3 \n                                      \n \nof appreciation issued by his commanders during the period 2003 to 2006. He was \nrepeatedly recognized as the staff professional of his squadron and group. (AE C) \n \nPsychological Conditions  \n \n \nIn April 2003, Applicant was diagnosed by the flight commander of the Life Skills \nSupport Center (LSSC) \u2013 a member of the Biomedical Sciences Corps (BSC) \u2013 as having \nan adjustment disorder with mixed anxiety and depressed mood, in part because of \nmarital issues involving his wife\u2019s $200 bar bill and a traumatic incident, described by his \nwife as an assault upon her by an instructor during a business trip. Applicant was referred \nto a family practice physician, and prescribed Xanax, a sedative used to treat anxiety and \npanic disorder. His case was closed on April 14, 2003, with no follow-up required. (GE 5 \n(Medical Records), at 25-30)  \n \n \nDuring 2004, Applicant and his pregnant wife were in the midst of marital discord \nand hostility, which eventually erupted into an ugly divorce and continuing child custody \nbattles involving the police, the courts, the command, and military medical personnel. On \nMay 12, 2004, Applicant started experiencing panic attacks, blurred vision, and dizziness, \nso he sought emergency medical assistance. He was diagnosed with panic attack and \nadministered a low dose of Temazepam \u2013 used to treat anxiety and insomnia. He was \nreleased. (GE 6 (Medical Records), at 79-90)  \n \n \nThe following day, Applicant voluntarily went to the Life Skills Support Clinic at the \nbase, where he was diagnosed by another LSSC flight commander as having Axis I: panic \ndisorder without agoraphobia (fear of places and situations), and V61.1 problems with \nsocial environment \u2013 partner relationship problem, and he was scheduled for inquiry and \ncounseling for marital conflict. He was prescribed Paxil and Ativan as needed \u2013 both \nantidepressant medications approved for the treatment of anxiety. (GE 5, at 19-24) On \nMay 19, 2004, after a 45-minute interview for marital and partner problems, unspecified, \nhe was again diagnosed with the same Axis I disorders, and he was again released. He \nwas seen again for the same issues on June 2, 2004 (for 50 minutes); June 15, 2004 (for \n35 minutes); and again on July 6, 2004 (for 35 minutes), and was released without \nlimitations. The July 6th diagnosis noted that the Axis I panic disorder without agoraphobia \nwas improved. Applicant needed no further follow up and the case was closed. (GE 5, at \n15-18; GE 6, at 109-113) \n \n \nThere is one medical record in evidence that is inaccurate. It states that an incident \noccurred on November 28, 2004, when Applicant was 28 years old (that encounter and \nrecord could not have taken place in 2004, because Applicant was only 26-years old on \nthat date). On that date, Applicant\u2019s 1st sergeant supposedly referred him to the chief, \nsocial work services, a licensed clinical social worker, because of allegations that \nApplicant had threatened to kill his wife and daughter, as well as kill himself. Applicant \ndenied the allegations, and noted that he and his wife were separated, and she was \nhaving an affair with a former friend. When he reported the situation to his commander, \nthe commander issued a no-contact order against him. However, no such order was \nissued in 2004. A No Contact Order was issued against Applicant on February 13, 2007, \nand again on April 30, 2007. (AE Y) Regardless of the date in issue, Applicant denied any \n\n \n4 \n                                      \n \nsuicidal or homicidal ideations. Despite the nature of the allegations, no immediate follow-\nup was ordered in the record, and Applicant was released. (GE 5, at 13) \n \n \n \nOn November 29, 2006, a command-directed evaluation was ordered, and \nApplicant went to the Mental Health Clinic. He was reportedly evaluated on that date and \non December 1, 2006, when he was seen for 45 minutes regarding the adjustment \ndisorder issues. Although Applicant denied any suicidal or homicidal ideations, \u201cgiven \nincongruent corroborating information, he was determined to be at significant risk of \npotential suicidal and/or homicidal action.\u201d The \u201cincongruent corroborating information\u201d \nwas not described or identified. The licensed clinical psychologist and the life skills \nelement chief concluded that Applicant \u201creflected delusions of persecution but no \nhallucinations.\u201d The specifics of the \u201cdelusions\u201d were not described or identified. They \nreported a diagnosis of Axis I: 300.01, V61.1, as well as rule out delusional disorder, \npersecutory type \u2013 an illness characterized by at least one month of delusions but no \nother psychotic symptoms. His Global Assessment of Functioning (GAF) Scale was 50, \nlowered to 45: serious symptoms. (GE 5, at 9-12) At some point, Applicant was prescribed \nEffexor \u2013 used to treat depression, generalized anxiety disorder, and panic disorder. \nApplicant chose to not attend a follow-up appointment with the licensed clinical \npsychologist. (GE 5, at 8) On December 19-20, 2006, he was again seen by the clinical \nsocial worker regarding administrative purposes. (GE 6, at 75-89) \n \n \nOn February 26, 2007, Applicant presented himself at the clinic to be evaluated for \nallegedly making statements regarding killing his wife and child, comments he denied \nmaking, in anticipation of appearing in court the following day. Despite displaying no \npsychotic signs or paranoia, and denying any suicidal intent or plan, and having intact \njudgment, it was determined that he was \u201ca moderate risk to self and/or others based \nupon the apparent discrepancy in reports and history even though he currently denies \n[suicidal ideation/homicidal ideation],\u201d and he was diagnosed as follows: Axis I: V61.12 \nphysical abuse of adult. The previous disorder 300.01 was not mentioned. The specifics \nof the \u201capparent discrepancy in reports and history\u201d as well as the basis for the V61.12 \ndiagnosis were not described or identified. Despite the moderate risk that Applicant \nsupposedly displayed, he was not scheduled to be seen in a follow up for another week. \n(GE 5, at 7) \n \n \nOn March 23, 2007, Applicant was seen in the Family Advocacy Center for a \nfollow-up appointment. He reported that he had been disciplined and deemed ineligible \nfor reenlistment, and was scheduled to separate from active duty in August 2007. \nApparently despondent over the entire turn of events, he said that the Air Force had failed \nhim and he no longer had any use for it. He also said that \u201chitting a woman or child is \nintolerable.\u201d (GE 5, at 5) The record reports that in a previous visit, without specifying the \ndate of that visit, Applicant said that \u201cthis uniform and his daughter keep him from harming \nhis wife and her alleged boyfriend.\u201d A report of such comments does not appear in any of \nthe medical records submitted to me. Upon being questioned by the family advocacy \nofficer, Applicant reportedly made several comments about his past as a member of the \nItalian mafia, harming various individuals and intimidating others, but he later disputed \nthat scenario, claiming that he was merely discussing a television show, The Sopranos, \nand song lyrics. (Tr. at 91-94, 115-116) When asked if he wanted to harm his wife and \n\n \n5 \n                                      \n \nher alleged boyfriend, he responded that if he wanted to do so, \u201cthey\u2019d be gone already.\u201d \nHe was diagnosed as follows: Axis I: V61.12 perpetrator of spouse abuse, and Axis II: \n301.81 narcissistic personality disorder, meets criteria 1 (grandiose sense of self-\nimportance), 2 (preoccupied with fantasies), 5 (sense of entitlement), 7 (lacks empathy), \nand 9 (shows arrogant, haughty behaviors or attitudes). (GE 5, at 6; Diagnostic and \nStatistical Manual of Disorders, 4th Edition \u2013 Text Revision (DSM-IV-TR), at 717) The \nprevious disorder 300.01 was not mentioned. There is no explanation regarding the basis \nof the source of the diagnosis \u201cperpetrator of spouse abuse,\u201d or the conclusions pertaining \nto the criteria supporting the Axis II disorder. Despite the comments made, Applicant was \nnot deemed to be suicidal or homicidal, and the risk remained moderate. He was \nscheduled to return in two weeks for a risk assessment. \n \n \nThereafter, on three different occasions in April 2007, May 2007, and August 2007, \nApplicant was reportedly seen by the same licensed clinical psychologist. The same \ndiagnoses were carried over without any new evaluations. The April 2007 mental health \nrecord indicated that a Treatment Team Meeting (TTM) was conducted, and that a full \nFamily Advocacy (FA) report was attached. No such report was in the file. (GE 5, at 4) \nDuring the May 2007 session, one week before Applicant was scheduled to commence \nhis terminal leave (May 11, 2007), Applicant stated that during his last session with a \nparticular provider, he \u201cfinally talked about his real issues.\u201d There is no medical record in \nevidence to reflect that particular session. No diagnostic changes were made. (GE 5, at \n2-3) Although there was no session conducted thereafter, there is a Mental Health Record \nmade by the licensed clinical psychologist that the record was being closed. That record \ncontains the following statement: \u201cthe impact of the treatment of military was \nadministratively discharged from active duty service based on the results of the \n[Command Directed Evaluation] and diagnosis of personality disorder.\u201d (GE 5, at 1) That \ncharacterization is patently false, and without any basis in fact, and the source of the \ncomment is not known. Separation action was never initiated, and the Separation Code \non Applicant\u2019s DD Form 214 was expiration of term of service, and his Reentry Code was \nserving suspended punishment to Art. 15. (AE A; Tr. at 99-100) \n \n \nDespite a plethora of clinical notes and session reports, none of the Air Force \nhealthcare providers who interviewed, evaluated, diagnosed, or treated Applicant actually \nperformed a mental health evaluation as described in DOD Instruction (DODI) 6490.4, \nRequirements for Mental Health Evaluations of Members of the Armed Forces (August \n28, 1997); DOD Instruction 6490.1, Mental Health Evaluations of Members of the Armed \nForces (October 1, 1997); or The American Psychiatric Association (APA) Practice \nGuideline for the Psychiatric Evaluation of Adults, 2nd Edition (June 2006). A mental health \nevaluation under DODI 6490.4 shall consist of, at a minimum: \n \nA clinical interview and mental status examination and may include, \nadditionally: a review of medical records; a review of other records, such as \nthe Service personnel record; information forwarded by the Service \nmember\u2019s commanding officer; psychological testing; physical examination; \nand laboratory and/or other specialized testing. Interviews conducted by \nthe Family Advocacy Program . . . are not considered mental health \n\n \n6 \n                                      \n \nevaluations for the purpose of [DODI 6490.1 . . . and [DODI 6490.4]. \n(Emphasis supplied) (DODI 6490.4, Enc. 2, \u00a7 E2.1.6) \n  \nThere are the repeated presence of terms such as suicidal ideation, homicidal \nideation, and depression in the clinical records, but not one of the clinical records in \nevidence indicates that any psychological testing was administered. There is no mention \nof the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory, 2nd revised version (MMPI-2), used \nfor measuring adult psychopathology; the Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-\nSSRS) to gather lifetime history of suicidality as well as any recent suicidal ideation or \nbehavior; the Personality Assessment Inventory (PAI) to assess emotional and \npersonality functioning; the Behavior and Symptom Identification Scale - 24 (BASIS \u2013 24) \nto assess the outcome of mental health or substance abuse treatment from the client\u2019s \nperspective; the Millon Clinical Multiaxial Inventory, 3rd Edition (MCMI-III) to measure 24 \npersonality disorders in assisting clinicians in psychiatric diagnoses, developing a \ntreatment approach, and guiding treatment decisions; the Patient Health Questionnaire \n(PHQ-2) to screen, diagnose, monitor, and measure the severity of depression; the \nPatient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) to screen, diagnose, monitor, and measure the \nseverity of depression; the Screening for Generalized Anxiety Disorder - 2 (GAD - 2), to \nscreen generalized anxiety; or the Screening for Generalized Anxiety Disorder - 7 (GAD \n- 7) to screen generalized anxiety.  \n \nMoreover, while there are several diagnoses, the clinicians failed to indicate why \nor how those impressions were specifically reached. Applicant repeatedly denied suicidal \nideations despite constant probing about his reported disorders. He felt that he was \nwrongfully suspected of having suicidal ideations or homicidal ideations, as well as what \nhe considered false allegations against him by his wife and her boyfriend, and he was \ndisappointed that the Air Force had failed him in summarily believing the worst about him, \nand disciplining him. At that point, he simply quit and started discussing the Italian mafia, \na television show, and some song lyrics. His position was seen as reluctance, sometimes \nreferred to as resistance, and was considered unacceptable, and it was not otherwise \nexamined or analyzed by the clinicians, although such an action is acknowledged in \npsychoanalysis.  \n \nSigmund Freud defined resistance as \u201cwhatever interrupts the progress of analytic \nwork,\u201d such as being late, missing a session, \u201cholding back\u201d your thoughts in the moment \n(i.e., refusing to speak about them) or avoiding a particular issue. In its most simple and \npractical sense, resistance results from fear. On the other hand, Jacques Lacan, a French \npsychoanalyst and psychiatrist, warned not to confuse resistance with defense and \nformulated the famous statement that \u201cthere is no other resistance to analysis than that \nof the analyst himself.\u201d In other words, if the psychotherapist makes interpretations or \ninterventions that are clinically inaccurate, the client will get defensive, and that will \ninterrupt the therapeutic work. In plain English, this means that a client will only explore \ntherapeutic material so far as is comfortable in the moment; the psychotherapist, \ntherefore, must always be aware of just how far the client is willing to go and not \u201cpush\u201d \nthe client beyond these temporary limits. Imprudent attempts to push a client can end up \npushing the client right out of psychotherapy, which seems to be the reason why Applicant \nchose not to fully participate in it. (http://www.guidetopsychology.com/btypes.htm, citing \n\n \n7 \n                                      \n \nSigmund Freud, The Interpretation of Dreams (Second Part), in Vol. V, The standard \nedition of the complete psychological works of Sigmund Freud (1953), at p. 517; Jacques \nLacan, \u201cThe Freudian thing, or the meaning of the return to Freud in psychoanalysis.\u201d In \n\u00c9crits: A selection, trans. Alan Sheridan (1977), at p. 129; Jacques Lacan, \u201cThe direction \nof the treatment and the principles of its power.\u201d In \u00c9crits: A selection, trans. Alan \nSheridan (1977), at p. 235.) \n \nAs noted above, Applicant\u2019s relationship with his wife eventually erupted into an \nugly divorce and continuing child custody battles involving the police, the courts, the \ncommand, and military medical personnel. His wife started filing actions against him \nshortly before she filed for divorce. First there were allegations that Applicant had \nthreatened her and their daughter as well as a report that Applicant had threatened his \nwife\u2019s boyfriend, both of which severely limited Applicant\u2019s access to his daughter, and \nresulted in the issuance of protective orders against Applicant, as well as his being \ndiagnosed for physical abuse of an adult. There are no statements from either Applicant\u2019s \nwife or her boyfriend in evidence to support any of those actions. The Military Protective \nOrder cites as the sole basis for the issuance of the order that Applicant\u2019s wife \u201cis \nconcerned for her safety and [Applicant has] shown behavior that could be interpreted as \nthreatening.\u201d (AE Y). Applicant was subsequently disciplined and reduced in grade for \nreportedly violating the no-contact orders, despite his assertions that her allegations were \nbaseless. Without substantially more information, there is nothing upon which to interpret \nthreatening behavior, or violations. Likewise, there is no information, statement, or police \nreport to support the basis for the issuance of no-contact orders, temporary injunctions, \nor the disciplinary punishment. \n \nDuring 2006 and 2007, there were a number of temporary injunctions for protection \nagainst domestic violence with minor children filed against Applicant (AE H; AE J; AE L), \nas well as an attempt to acquire child custody (AE I); and motions for extensions of \ninjunction from protection against domestic violence. (AE K; AE Q) Applicant had to file a \nmotion for contempt and imposition of sanctions against his wife in 2007, because she \nrefused to comply with his child visitation rights. (AE P) The Final Judgment of Divorce \nwas entered January 16, 2008. (AE G) Applicant\u2019s ex-wife filed three motions for civil \ncontempt against Applicant in 2012, but all of them were denied, including one for a late \npayment of $5.25 as part of a check that she refused to accept. (AE W) She also claimed \nthat Applicant had sexually abused their daughter in 2012, but that charge was \nsubsequently dropped. \n \nOn October 2, 2012, on January 23, 2013, and again on March 20, 2013, Applicant \nattended a Deprivation Hearing, based on a complaint filed on behalf of Applicant\u2019s ex-\nwife. During that hearing, Applicant\u2019s ex-wife testified that before their divorce, Applicant \npurchased a handgun and threatened to shoot her with it and take their daughter away. \nShe reported the threat and the military took his weapon away. When he did it a second \ntime, another handgun was taken from him, and under the local Baker Act \u2013 an existing \nlaw that provides for temporary institutionalization of individuals who meet certain criteria. \nIt can only be used by specific authorized persons, including judges, mental health \nprofessionals, law enforcement personnel, and doctors. More importantly, the law is \nlimited by the fact that those officials must have sound evidence suggesting that the \n\n \n8 \n                                      \n \nindividual might meet the Act\u2019s definition for mental illness. In addition, he must pose a \nrisk of harm to himself or others \u2013 or demonstrate self-neglect. It should be noted that the \nstatutory criteria require more than mere suspicion of mental illness or potential risk. The \nstatute specifically calls for \u201csubstantial\u201d evidence, which is much higher bar than simple \nsuspicion. As a result, people cannot be involuntarily institutionalized simply because \nthey\u2019re acting strangely, refuse to seek psychiatric examinations, or have occasional \nmood swings or outbursts.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s ex-wife described their daughter as always crying before, during, and \nafter her interactions with Applicant. However, the guardian ad litem expressed that she \nhad no concerns about the child being around Applicant or his weapons. Nevertheless, \nApplicant\u2019s ex-wife argued that Applicant should be disqualified from possessing a \nconcealed weapon because he had been in a mental hospital. (AE W) The matter was \nfinally dropped, and Applicant was, once again, granted full visitation rights. \n \nIn 2017, the DOD CAF referred Applicant for a psychological evaluation. He was \ninterviewed for an unspecified period and administered only one psychological test: the \nPAI, but the results of that test were deemed invalid. In a psychological report, dated \nNovember 21, 2017, that clinician noted that she had reviewed \u201cthe medical record,\u201d \nwithout identifying any of the specific documents, and she discounted several of \nApplicant\u2019s comments as being at odds with information that was in the unidentified \nmaterials furnished to her by the DOD CAF: that he has a history of hospitalization for \nsuicidal and homicidal ideation; that he had been discharged due to the results of a \ncommand directed evaluation and diagnosis of personality disorder; that a review of \nmedical records indicates scenarios involving threats to his ex-wife\u2019s boyfriend; that \nApplicant\u2019s denials regarding threats of violence to his ex-wife and her now-husband are \ninconsistent with the accounts of events in the records furnished; that Applicant\u2019s denials \nof any history of suicidal or homicidal ideation are refuted by the records to the contrary; \nthat he denied other events that are noted within the record; that he tends to portray \nhimself as being exceptionally free of common shortcomings to which most individuals \nwill admit; and that Applicant\u2019s comments regarding disputed information is considered to \nbe of questionable validity. (GE 3) The psychologist concluded: \n \nApplicant has a documented history of narcissistic personality disorder, but \ninterestingly also shows some of the atypical thinking (unusual beliefs, \nparanoia), odd speech, and social skill deficits (lack of close friends, social \nawkwardness) commonly seen in an individual with schizotypal personality \ndisorder. \n \nThe diagnosis in this case would render the patient in need of consistent \ntreatment (until symptoms remit, which is uncommon with diagnosis of this \nnature), but this has clearly not occurred at this point. My prognosis is poor, \ngiven the ingrained nature of his issues and poor likelihood for treatment \ncompliance. His psychological symptoms could certainly impede his \njudgment. . . Based upon his legal history, volatile mood and behaviors, and \nhis history of interpersonal conflicts, it appears that [Applicant] is likely to \nhave impaired reliability. (GE 3) \n\n \n9 \n                                      \n \n \nBecause of the lack of specificity in the psychological report, especially when it \ncomes to source documentation upon which Applicant\u2019s comments were not accepted, \nas well as to the source documentation or other information upon which the psychologist \nrelied to find the presence of unusual beliefs, paranoia, odd speech, and social skill \ndeficits (lack of close friends, social awkwardness), and the absence of psychological \ntesting, it is unclear if the psychologist complied with the requirements of DODI 6490.4, \nMental Health Evaluations of Members of the Military Services (March 4, 2013); DOD \nInstruction 6490.1, Mental Health Evaluations of Members of the Armed Forces (October \n1, 1997); or even the APA Practice Guidelines for the Psychiatric Evaluation of Adults \u2013 \n3rd Edition (2016). In this regard, while Applicant is not currently a member of the military \nservices, it remains unclear if the DODIs have been adopted for DOD CAF purposes with \nrespect to government contractors. Accordingly, the thoroughness and accuracy of the \nevaluation report remain open to question. \nWork Performance and Character References \n \n \nThe former officer-in charge of the unit where Applicant served between October \n2004 and July 2006, stated that Applicant displayed exceptional positive characteristics \nin duty performance, leadership qualities and in his personal life. His dedication to the \nmission was always exhibited through outstanding performance. He volunteered for \nseveral events. Off duty, Applicant attended church and played softball for his church \nteam. Applicant was one of his hardest-working, knowledgeable troops that he would not \nonly want working in his section, but one day running it. (AE B) \nThe former operations officer of the squadron considered Applicant to be a critical \nmember of the unit whose performance was never less than exceptional. Applicant\u2019s duty \nperformance, military bearing, and professionalism were of the highest level. Not only \nwas he skilled in his primary duties, but he continuously sought additional workload to \nease the burden on fellow colleagues. He would, without hesitation, bank on Applicant\u2019s \nability to accomplish any task presented to him.  (AE B) \nThe former superintendent of the maintenance operations flight described \nApplicant\u2019s professionalism, military bearing and duty performance to be of the highest \nlevel. He supported the squadron booster club by donating his time to help raise funds \nfor the squadron\u2019s holiday party and other activities, and was an avid supporter of the \nlocal community, helping to build homes for Habitat for Humanity. (AE B) \nCurrent coworkers, including the president of the local union, have described him \nin stressful and complicated situations requiring high levels of patience, intelligence, and \nunderstanding, and Applicant met every challenge, deadline, and goal presented and \ntackled every problem with grace and ease. Many of Applicant\u2019s solutions were insightful \nand practical, and he showed a remarkable capacity for breaking large issues into \nmanageable segments. Applicant is also a cooperative and attentive team player. His \nactions consistently inspired and motivated other employees in the office. Applicant was \ninstrumental in assisting members who are out of work, as well as assisting those affected \nby a hurricane. He has always been honest and forthcoming. (AE B)  \n\n \n10 \n                                      \n \nOne character witness met Applicant in 2002 when the witness was newly \nstationed at the same base. Applicant opened his home to the new arrival and invited him \nto the house for the 4th of July celebrations. He noted that Applicant was always receiving \nawards because he was a top airman.  Applicant was always willing to give his shirt off \nhis back for people. He never saw Applicant become angry or enraged. As time went on, \nthe witness and Applicant and his wife did many things together, and Applicant\u2019s \nrelationship with his wife seemed normal. Things changed when Applicant\u2019s wife started \ndating another individual who was residing in their home. It was the witness\u2019s impression \nthat Applicant\u2019s wife would \u201ccry wolf\u201d and be vengeful. At one point, while the witness was \nresiding in Applicant\u2019s house, Applicant\u2019s wife lied when she said that the witness had \ncornered her in the kitchen \u2013 something that never happened \u2013 so he immediately moved \nout of the house. Applicant\u2019s wife\u2019s boyfriend kept threatening Applicant for years, saying \nthat he was going to \u201ckick his butt.\u201d As Applicant\u2019s marital situation became more \nantagonistic, it was the witness\u2019s impression that the unit leadership was supportive of \nApplicant, but the Command was simply trying to cover themselves by following protocol. \nThe witness has never seen Applicant display any suicidal or homicidal ideation. He \nbelieves Applicant is trustworthy and has integrity. (Tr. at 22-20) \nOne character witness has known Applicant since they were in the same military \nunit. After Applicant relocated, they met one day at a local store, and Applicant told him \nabout an employment opening, and they have been with the same employer since \nNovember 2010. Before joining the same organization, the witness served as a police \nofficer. The witness was aware of Applicant\u2019s marital situation, hearing about it from other \npeople, and seeing Applicant\u2019s reactions. There were threats, legal action, unnecessary \nlegal action, and going after money by the ex-wife and her now husband. He has never \nseen Applicant lose his temper or act irrationally. Applicant has come to his aid and helped \nmove the witness\u2019s mother. About 12 or 13 years ago, the Command issued a be-on-the \nlookout (BOLO) flyer on Applicant. Applicant\u2019s reputation as a coworker is spectacular. \n(Tr. at 34-47; AE B) \nPolicies \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the Executive \nBranch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security emphasizing, \n\u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d (Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. \n518, 528 (1988)). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to control \naccess to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual \nis sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information. The standard that must be \nmet is that, based on all available information, the person\u2019s loyalty, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness are such that granting the person access to classified information is \nclearly consistent with the interests of national security.  \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines in SEAD 4. In addition to \nbrief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating \nan applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n\n \n11 \n                                      \n \nAn administrative judge need not view the guidelines as inflexible, ironclad rules \nof law. Instead, acknowledging the complexities of human behavior, the administrative \njudge applies these guidelines in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative \nprocess. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. The entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of \nvariables known as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a meaningful decision. The concept recognizes that we should \nview a person by the totality of his or her acts, omissions, motivations and other variables. \nEach case must be adjudged on its own merits, taking into consideration all relevant \ncircumstances, and applying sound judgment, mature thinking, and careful analysis. \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours as well. It is \nbecause of this special relationship that the Government must be able to repose a high \ndegree of trust and confidence in those individuals to whom it grants access to classified \ninformation. \n \nDecisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the applicant \nmay deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified information. Such \ndecisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather \nthan actual, risk of compromise of sensitive information.  Furthermore, security clearance \ndeterminations should err, if they must, on the side of denials. (Department of the Navy \nv. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988)). In reaching this decision, I have drawn only those \nconclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on the evidence contained in the \nrecord. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere speculation or \nconjecture. \n \nAnalysis \n \nAt the outset, I note I had ample opportunity to evaluate the demeanor of Applicant, \nobserve his manner and deportment, appraise the way in which he responded to \nquestions, assess his candor or evasiveness, read his statements, and listen to his \ntestimony. It is my impression that his explanations regarding his psychological conditions \nissues are consistent and have the solid resonance of truth. \n \nUpon consideration of all the facts in evidence, including those in the DOD CAF \ncase file, those submitted by Applicant, and his testimony, and the testimony of others, \nas well as an assessment of Applicant=s demeanor and credibility, and after application \nof all appropriate legal precepts and factors, I conclude the following with respect to the \nallegations set forth in the SOR: \n \nGuideline I, Psychological Conditions \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Psychological Conditions is set \nout in AG \u00b6 27: \n\n \n12 \n                                      \n \n \nCertain emotional, mental, and personality conditions can impair judgment, \nreliability, or trustworthiness. A formal diagnosis of a disorder is not required \nfor there to be a concern under this guideline. A duly qualified mental health \nprofessional (e.g., clinical psychologist or psychiatrist) employed by, or \nacceptable to and approved by the U.S. Government, should be consulted \nwhen evaluating potentially disqualifying and mitigating information under \nthis guideline and an opinion, including prognosis, should be sought. No \nnegative inference concerning the standards in this guideline may be raised \nsolely on the basis of mental health counseling. \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 28:  \n \n(a) behavior that casts doubt on an individual's judgment, stability, reliability, \nor trustworthiness, not covered under any other guideline and that may \nindicate an emotional, mental, or personality condition, including, but not \nlimited to, irresponsible, violent, self-harm, suicidal, paranoid, manipulative, \nimpulsive, chronic lying, deceitful, exploitative, or bizarre behaviors;  \n \n(b) an opinion by a duly qualified mental health professional that the \nindividual has a condition that may impair judgment, stability, reliability, or \ntrustworthiness;  \n(c) voluntary or involuntary inpatient hospitalization; and  \n(d) failure to follow a prescribed treatment plan related to a diagnosed \npsychological/psychiatric condition that may impair judgment, stability, \nreliability, or trustworthiness, including, but not limited to, failure to take \nprescribed medication or failure to attend required counseling sessions. \nIn 2006, Applicant\u2019s wife and her boyfriend made allegations to the police and the \nCommand that Applicant had threatened to kill them and Applicant\u2019s daughter, as well as \nkill himself. No-contact orders were issued to Applicant by the Command; he was directed \nto undergo a mental health evaluation; it was determined that Applicant was at significant \nrisk of potential suicidal and/or homicidal action; it was later determined that he was a \nmoderate risk to self and/or others; he was reported to be in violation of the no-contact \norders; he was disciplined and reduced in grade; and he was diagnosed as a perpetrator \nof spouse abuse, as well as a narcissistic personality disorder. In 2012, Applicant\u2019s ex-\nwife accused him of sexually abusing their daughter. \nIn 2017, at the direction of the DOD CAF, Applicant was evaluated by a licensed \nclinical psychologist. She determined that Applicant has a documented history of \nnarcissistic personality disorder, but also shows some of the atypical thinking such as \nunusual beliefs, and paranoia, odd speech, and social skill deficits such as a lack of close \nfriends, and social awkwardness commonly seen in an individual with schizotypal \npersonality disorder. She added: \n\n \n13 \n                                      \n \nthe diagnosis in this case would render the patient in need of consistent \ntreatment (until symptoms remit, which is uncommon with diagnosis of this \nnature), but this has clearly not occurred at this point. My prognosis is poor, \ngiven the ingrained nature of his issues and poor likelihood for treatment \ncompliance. His psychological symptoms could certainly impede his \njudgment. . . Based upon his legal history, volatile mood and behaviors, and \nhis history of interpersonal conflicts, it appears that [Applicant] is likely to \nhave impaired reliability. \n \nBased solely on the facts briefly referred to above, AG \u00b6\u00b6 28(a), 28(b), and 28(c) \nhave been established. AG \u00b6 28(d) has not been established because, while there may \nbe evidence of a diagnosed psychological/psychiatric condition that may impair judgment, \nstability, reliability, or trustworthiness, there is little, if any, evidence to reflect any failure \nto follow a prescribed treatment plan related to the diagnosed condition(s) other than \nApplicant\u2019s decision not to attend some recommended family counseling sessions over a \ndecade ago. \n \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns arising from psychological conditions under AG \u00b6 29:  \n \n(a) the identified condition is readily controllable with treatment, and the \nindividual has demonstrated ongoing and consistent compliance with the \ntreatment plan; \n \n(b) the individual has voluntarily entered a counseling or treatment program \nfor a condition that is amenable to treatment, and the individual is currently \nreceiving counseling or treatment with a favorable prognosis by a duly \nqualified mental health professional; \n \n(c) recent opinion by a duly qualified mental health professional employed \nby, or acceptable to and approved by, the U.S. Government that an \nindividual's previous condition is under control or in remission, and has a \nlow probability of recurrence or exacerbation; \n \n(d) the past psychological/psychiatric condition was temporary, the situation \nhas been resolved, and the individual no longer shows indications of \nemotional instability; and \n \n(e) there is no indication of a current problem. \n \n \nThe complete record reflects that before Applicant and his first wife went through \nmarital discord, and for a period thereafter, he had a stellar military record; he was highly \nthought of by his Command and his units; his superiors and coworkers praised his duty \nperformance, military bearing, professionalism, community-service activities; he received \nrecognition for his performance; and he had an excellent reputation for honesty, integrity, \nand trustworthiness. Character references saw no evidence of any suicidal or homicidal \nideations, and never saw Applicant lose his temper or act irrationally. Applicant\u2019s \n\n \n14 \n                                      \n \nreputation and background were summarily cast aside when allegations of misconduct \narose. \n \n \nDivorce and child custody disputes have been routinely known to become ugly and \nhostile, and the situation reported in this instance is not shocking or unusual, for it merely \nsuggests a planned road map to success by one litigant against the other. One shocking \nor unusual feature in this case is the robotic manner in which there does not seem to be \nany analysis or investigation by the police or Command authorities to determine the truth \nof the allegations, explore the possible motivations for the allegations, or consider \nApplicant\u2019s repeated denials regarding those allegations, especially when he had a \nsterling reputation for honesty, integrity, and trustworthiness. No one in authority ever \nexamined Applicant\u2019s ex-wife\u2019s allegations of an assault by an instructor while on a \nbusiness trip; the alleged incident in the kitchen when she claimed she was cornered by \na tenant; or her allegations of assault on their daughter in 2012. Perhaps they could have \nconnected the dots between those allegations and the ones against Applicant.  \n \n \nAs noted above, the only documented evidence of one of those allegations \nappears in the Military Protective Order which cites as the sole basis for the issuance of \nthe order that Applicant\u2019s wife \u201cis concerned for her safety and [Applicant has] shown \nbehavior that could be interpreted as threatening.\u201d The exact statement was not recorded; \nthere is no evidence that it was under oath; there is no evidence of an investigation into \nthe truth of the allegations; it is unclear what the specific concerns of the wife were; and \nit is also unclear who made the interpretation that what was reportedly said was \nthreatening. Despite unit reservations regarding the allegations, and Applicant\u2019s repeated \ndenials, the initial steps to destroying Applicant\u2019s military career had begun. The local \nBaker Act \u2013 something now commonly referred to as the Red Flag Law \u2013 was applied, \nwithout due process, forcing Applicant to turn in his weapons, based solely on his wife\u2019s \nallegations; he was disciplined and reduced in grade for reportedly violating the no-\ncontact orders, based on additional allegations by his wife; he was ordered to undergo a \ncommand directed mental health evaluation; and he was required to attend Family \nAdvocacy Program and LSSC sessions. \n \n \nFar more disturbing than the robotic manner in which certain actions were taken \nby the police and Command authorities, were the somewhat superficial and unexplained \nactions taken by the mental health providers within the military system, most of which \ncannot be considered mental health evaluations under DODI 6490.1, or DODI 6490.4. \nApplicant initially went through a number of interview sessions, generally consisting of \nbetween 35 and 50 minutes each, after which he was prescribed medications for \ndepression, anxiety, panic disorder, and insomnia.  \n \n \nOn November 29, 2006, and December 1, 2006, after being seen for merely 45 \nminutes, with no evidence of any psychological testing administered to Applicant, it was \ndetermined that he was \u201cat significant risk of potential suicidal and/or homicidal action.\u201d \nApplicant\u2019s denials were disregarded because of \u201cincongruent corroborating information,\u201d \nnot otherwise identified or described. Additionally, the life skills element chief concluded \nthat Applicant \u201creflected delusions of persecution but no hallucinations.\u201d The specifics of \nthose delusions were not described or identified. It is interesting that, despite significant \n\n \n15 \n                                      \n \nrisk of potential suicidal and/or homicidal action, Applicant was not involuntarily \nhospitalized. Perhaps it was because those conditions were not as reported. \n \n \nOn February 26, 2007, again without being administered any psychological tests, \nbased on the \u201capparent discrepancy in reports and history,\u201d not otherwise identified or \ndescribed, he was found to be at moderate risk to self and/or others, and given a \ndiagnosis of physical abuse of adult. There is no documented basis for this diagnosis, \nand the factual sources leading to it are unknown. On March 23, 2007, the family \nadvocacy officer boot-strapped the earlier information to the file and altered the V61.12 \ndiagnosis to perpetrator of spouse abuse, without any explanation, and added an entirely \nnew diagnosis of narcissistic personality disorder, claiming it meets criteria 1 (grandiose \nsense of self-importance), 2 (preoccupied with fantasies), 5 (sense of entitlement), 7 \n(lacks empathy), and 9 (shows arrogant, haughty behaviors or attitudes). The bases for \nthose findings were not described, and they appear to be at odds with descriptions of \nApplicant by his superiors and coworkers \u2013 information that no healthcare provider or \nCommand leadership ever sought to provide. Despite the comments made, Applicant was \nnot deemed to be suicidal or homicidal, and the risk remained moderate. He was \nscheduled to return in two weeks for a risk assessment. \n \n \nThere is a Mental Health Record made by the licensed clinical psychologist that \nthe record was being closed without Applicant again being seen. That record contains the \nfollowing statement: \u201cthe impact of the treatment of military was administratively \ndischarged from active duty service based on the results of the [Command Directed \nEvaluation] and diagnosis of personality disorder.\u201d That characterization is patently false, \nand without any basis in fact, and the source of the comment is not known. Nevertheless, \nit was subsequently included in a subsequent DOD CAF-directed mental health \nevaluation over a decade later, as well as an allegation in the SOR. \n \nAs noted above, in 2017, at the direction of the DOD CAF, Applicant was evaluated \nby a licensed clinical psychologist. It is not known whether she used the DSM-IV-TR or \nthe DSM-5 in making her evaluation. She determined that Applicant has a documented \nhistory of narcissistic personality disorder, but also shows some of the atypical thinking \nsuch as unusual beliefs, and paranoia, odd speech, and social skill deficits such as a lack \nof close friends, and social awkwardness commonly seen in an individual with schizotypal \npersonality disorder. She failed to describe the basis for her conclusions of atypical \nthinking, unusual beliefs, paranoia, odd speech, social skills deficits, lack of close friends, \nand social awkwardness, especially in light of his many supporters and friends. In the \nabsence of such information, her conclusions are considered baseless. Far more \ntroubling is her reliance on the \u201chistorical\u201d information \u2013 Applicant\u2019s negative legal history, \nvolatile mood and behaviors, and his history of interpersonal conflicts \u2013 furnished to her \nby the DOD CAF without further investigation.  \n \nSince the only negative information in evidence appears to be the complaints of \nApplicant\u2019s ex-wife and her boyfriend during the period 2004 through 2008, and again in \n2012, it is unclear what that negative legal history (except for unverified allegations \nappearing in a past evaluation that he had bashed someone\u2019s head in at the age of 19, \nand the accusation by his ex-wife that he had sexually abused his daughter in 2012), \n\n \n16 \n                                      \n \nvolatile mood and behaviors, and his history of interpersonal conflicts, consists of. The \nclinician failed to consider any favorable information about Applicant, including his over-\na-decade without problems; the continuing actions by his ex-wife in making false \nallegations against him; the guardian ad litem\u2019s changed position regarding his \nrelationship with his daughter; his supportive wife, colleagues, and friends; and \nApplicant\u2019s repeated denials of suicidal or homicidal ideations. Instead, she merely \nbootstrapped her information to that of previous \u201cevaluations\u201d that also contained \nunverified or unsourced information. She did not explain why there is a poor likelihood for \ntreatment compliance, and did not explain why it is likely that Applicant will have impaired \nreliability. According to the DSM-IV-TR, \u201cmany highly successful individuals display \npersonality traits that might be considered narcissistic. Only when these traits are \ninflexible, maladaptive, and persisting and cause significant functional impairment or \nsubjective distress do they constitute Narcissistic Personality Disorder.\u201d (DSM-IV-TR, at \n717) This clinician failed to justify her diagnosis and prognosis under either DSM-IV-TR \nor DSM-5. \n \nMeaningful due process and fundamental fairness require that individuals be \npresented with all the evidence used to support allegations against them. Merely \nfurnishing summaries of activities, impressions of third parties, characterizations of \ninformation without the documents supporting those characterizations, or conclusions \nbased on unspecified and unverified facts, is not sufficient, especially when the alleged \nevents occurred over a decade ago. Documents considered mental health evaluations, \nespecially those that cannot be considered as such by DODI 6490.1 and DODI 6490.4, \nare unacceptable.  \n \nThe existence of a psychological condition does not preclude the granting of a \nsecurity clearance. Some conditions are unrelated to security issues and others can be \nmitigated by ongoing treatment or other factors. Unfortunately, mental health evaluations \nthat contain unverified or inaccurate information, or only one side of the story, are far \nmore damaging because of the high level of deference generally given to clinicians and \ntheir opinions. In this instance, because of the lack of confidence in the quality, \ncompleteness, and accuracy of the most recent \u201cpsychological evaluation,\u201d I have given \nit less weight than I might have if: more thorough psychological tests had been \nadministered and scored; the errors in the report had been corrected; Applicant\u2019s denials \nhad been even minimally explored; the situation involving the continuing custody struggle \nhad been considered; and unidentified sources had been provided. Accordingly, while AG \n\u00b6\u00b6 29(a), 29(b), 29(c), and 29(d) do not apply, AG \u00b6 29(e) applies because I have \ndetermined that the duly qualified mental health professional\u2019s 2017 opinion, diagnosis, \nand prognosis are too riddled with errors and omissions to be of much value.  \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the appellant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n\n \n17 \n                                      \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. Moreover, I have \nevaluated the various aspects of this case in light of the totality of the record evidence \nand have not merely performed a piecemeal analysis. (See U.S. v. Bottone, 365 F.2d \n389, 392 (2d Cir. 1966)) \n  \n \nThere is some evidence against mitigating Applicant\u2019s conduct. In 2006, \nApplicant\u2019s then-wife and her boyfriend made allegations to the police and the Command \nthat Applicant had threatened to kill them and Applicant\u2019s daughter, as well as kill himself. \nNo-contact orders were issued to Applicant by the Command; he was directed to undergo \na mental health evaluation; it was determined that Applicant was at significant risk of \npotential suicidal and/or homicidal action; it was later determined that he was a moderate \nrisk to self and/or others; he was reported to be in violation of the no-contact orders; he \nwas disciplined and reduced in grade; and he was diagnosed as a perpetrator of spouse \nabuse, as well as a narcissistic personality disorder. In 2012, Applicant\u2019s ex-wife accused \nhim of sexually abusing their daughter. A 2017 psychological evaluation, to which I have \ngiven minimum weight because of issues discussed above, described concerns regarding \nApplicant\u2019s judgment and reliability. \n \n \nThe mitigating evidence under the whole-person concept is simply more \nsubstantial. Applicant is a 41-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has been \nserving as a maintenance control lead with his current employer since February 2010. He \nis a 1996 high school graduate, with some college credits, but no degree. Applicant \nenlisted in the U.S. Air Force in October 2001, and he served on active duty until August \n2007, when he was honorably discharged. Before the marital and child custody issues \narose, Applicant had a stellar military record; he was highly thought of by his Command \nand his units; his superiors and coworkers praised his duty performance, military bearing, \nprofessionalism, and community-service activities; he received recognition for his \nperformance; and he had an excellent reputation for honesty, integrity, and \ntrustworthiness. He was granted a top secret clearance in 2003. His record with his \ncurrent employer is also one of stellar performance. Character references, including some \ninitially from his military service years as well as some with continuing long-term \nrelationships, have never seen any evidence of suicidal or homicidal ideations, and have \nnever seen Applicant lose his temper or act irrationally.  \n \n \nThe sole sources for the problems initially facing Applicant were his then-wife and \nher boyfriend, shortly before a divorce and custody battle erupted well over a decade ago. \n\n \n18 \n                                      \n \nThe environment in which the entire situation took place is extraordinarily significant: an \nugly divorce and continuing child custody battle. They were the ones alleging that \nApplicant made certain statements and threats, and took certain actions against them as \nwell as Applicant\u2019s daughter, that sparked the actions taken by the civil and military \nauthorities. They were the ones who essentially destroyed Applicant\u2019s military career, \nlimited his relationship with his daughter, and subsequently tried destroying his current \ncareer. Despite her history of false allegations against three individuals, including \nApplicant, the authorities accepted her allegations against Applicant, and they flatly \ndenied his side of the story. Applicant\u2019s ex-wife made a false allegation against one \ncharacter reference, claiming that he had cornered her in the kitchen of her residence, \nand she made another allegation, seemingly not otherwise followed-up upon regarding \nan instructor who reportedly assaulted her. At least one character witness also noted that \nApplicant\u2019s ex-wife\u2019s now-husband (the former boyfriend) kept threatening Applicant. \n \n \nMy comments regarding the quality, thoroughness, and accuracy of the \npsychological or mental health evaluations made, as well as the absence of significant \ndocumentation and other source material in evidence, remain as previously stated.  \nApplicant\u2019s past psychological conditions, to the extent that there were some, under the \ncircumstances no longer cast doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, and good \njudgment. \nOverall, the evidence leaves me without questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s \neligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all of these reasons, I conclude \nApplicant has mitigated the security concerns arising from his psychological conditions. \nSee SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6\u00b6 2(d)(1) through 2(d)(9). \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline I:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a. through 1.e.:  \nFor Applicant  \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security clearance.  \nEligibility for access to classified information is granted. \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nROBERT ROBINSON GALES \nAdministrative Judge \n \n",

His current employment contract is for about $170,000 annually. His formal education consists of a high school diploma and some college. His employment history includes honorable service in the U.S. Army during 1990-1988. He served for the first three years as a tanker (the armor branch), and the last five years in satellite communications. He was granted a security clearance for the first time during his military service. He has worked for a number of companies in the defense industry since 1998.

De Angelis, Esq., Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro se   \n \n \n08/06/2019 \n______________ \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \n \n \nLEONARD, Michael H., Administrative Judge: \n \nApplicant contests the Defense Department\u2019s intent to revoke his eligibility for \naccess to classified information. He was terminated from employment in February 2015 \ndue to intentional time mischarging. He explained that it was his common practice to \nwork more hours than the 40 hours he charged. His workplace misconduct is mitigated \nas an isolated incident that is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on his reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment. Accordingly, this case is decided for Applicant.    \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nApplicant completed and submitted a Questionnaire for National Security \nPositions (SF 86 format) on April 30, 2015. (Exhibit 1) This document is commonly \nknown as a security clearance application. Thereafter, on March 27, 2018, after \nreviewing the application and the information gathered during a background \ninvestigation, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications Facility, Fort \nMeade, Maryland, sent Applicant a statement of reasons (SOR), explaining it was \nunable to find that it was clearly consistent with the national interest to grant him \neligibility for access to classified information. The SOR is similar to a complaint. It \n\n \n2 \n \ndetailed the factual reasons for the action under the security guideline known as \nGuideline E for personal conduct. The SOR alleged the following two matters: (1) \nApplicant was terminated from his employment in about February 2015 due to \nintentional time mischarging; and (2) he falsified his April 2015 security clearance \napplication by omitting the February 2015 termination in response to a question about \nhis employment history.   \n \nApplicant answered the SOR on April 11, 2018. He admitted the SOR allegations \nwith explanations in which he denied intentionally lying on his security clearance \napplication. He requested a decision based on the written record in lieu of a hearing.  \nThereafter, Department Counsel made a timely request for a hearing. (Tr. 18-21; \nAppellate Exhibit I)   \n \nThe case was assigned to me on July 25, 2018. The hearing was conducted as \nscheduled on September 20, 2018. Department Counsel offered documentary exhibits, \nwhich were admitted without objections as Exhibits 1, 2, and 3, but Exhibit 4 was not \nadmitted. Applicant offered three letters of recommendation, which were admitted as \nExhibits A, B, and C. Other than Applicant, no witnesses were called.  \n \nExhibit 4 is a three-page letter, dated February 19, 2015, from Applicant\u2019s former \nemployer. (Tr. 49-56) The writer is identified as an assistant general counsel of the \ncompany. The letter is a summarized account of the investigative steps and findings \nthat led to Applicant\u2019s termination in February 2015. The letter was offered after \nDepartment Counsel completed their case-in-chief and during cross-examination of \nApplicant. The letter was not obtained during the course of Applicant\u2019s background \ninvestigation; it was obtained by Department Counsel about a week before the hearing; \nit was not provided to Applicant in advance of the hearing; and he saw the document for \nthe first time during the hearing. (Tr. 50-52)  \n \nApplicant objected, and Exhibit 4 was not admitted due to lack of authentication \nas required under \u00b6 E3.1.20 of Enclosure 3 to the Directive. (Tr. 52-56) Upon further \nreview of the exhibit, it is difficult to determine if the assistant general counsel had first-\nhand knowledge of the information he was relating in the document or if he was relying \non information provided by others in the company. In addition, admission of Exhibit 4, \nwithout an authenticating witness, would have deprived Applicant of the opportunity to \ncross-examine the person or persons who produced Exhibit 4 on information adverse to \nApplicant, contrary to Executive Order 10865 \u00a7 3(6) and \u00b6 4.3.3 of the Directive.  \n \nIn closing argument, Department Counsel stated they found Applicant\u2019s \ntestimony and explanation sufficiently credible and they were no longer concerned \nabout the falsification allegation in SOR \u00b6 1.b. (Tr. 76)  Accordingly, given Department \nCounsel\u2019s position, the falsification allegation is decided for Applicant, and it will not be \naddressed further herein. The hearing transcript (Tr.) was received on September 26, \n2018.    \n \n \n \n\n \n3 \n \n  Findings of Fact \n \nApplicant is a 46-year-old employee who is seeking to retain a security clearance \npreviously granted to him by the Defense Department. He is employed by a company \nworking in the defense industry as a satellite communications engineer. He has had his \ncurrent job since March 2018. His current employment contract is for about $170,000 \nannually. His formal education consists of a high school diploma and some college. His \nemployment history includes honorable service in the U.S. Army during 1990-1988. He \nserved for the first three years as a tanker (the armor branch), and the last five years in \nsatellite communications. He was granted a security clearance for the first time during \nhis military service. He has worked for a number of companies in the defense industry \nsince 1998. He has spent about 18 years working overseas in several countries in the \nMiddle East, including eight years in Afghanistan and four years in Iraq. (Tr. 69-71)  \n \nApplicant\u2019s February 2015 termination arises from the timeframe of December \n2014-January 2015, when he was working at a temporary duty location in the \ncontinental United States. He was employed with this company for less than a year, \nbeginning in August 2014 and ending with his termination in February 2015. Upon his \ntermination, the former employer\u2019s security office submitted an adverse information \nreport, which stated that an investigation conducted by the company\u2019s internal audit \noffice determined that Applicant had engaged in intentional time mischarging, and that \nApplicant was terminated as a result on February 6, 2015. (Exhibit 2) No further details \nof the incident were provided in the report.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s termination was reviewed during the course of his most recent \nbackground investigation. According to a report of investigation (ROI), Applicant was \ninterviewed in April 2016 and provided information about his previous termination. \n(Exhibit 3) The ROI states, among other things, that Applicant \u201cvolunteered that he was \nterminated from employment with [former employer] due to filling out his time card \nincorrectly by not claiming all hours that [he] worked. Applicant was physically working \n65-70 hours a week and was only claiming 40 hours per week on his time card.\u201d In other \nwords, Applicant was undercharging as opposed to overcharging his hours.   \n \nApplicant provided the same explanation during the hearing. (Tr. 28-31) He \nstated that he was accustomed to a workplace culture that expected an employee to put \nin extra hours. But he also acknowledged his practice was \u2018kind of cheating\u201d because it \ngave an inaccurate account of his time. (Tr. 29) He unequivocally denied overcharging \nby claiming more hours than actually worked. (Tr. 44, 47, and 60-61) He stated that \nduring the termination or exit interview his former employer told him the basis for \ntermination was undercharging hours, and they made the point it was just as bad or \nwrongful as overcharging hours. (Tr. 44)  \n \nApplicant presented three highly favorable letters of recommendation. A former \ndirect supervisor wrote that Applicant always displayed outstanding professionalism, \ngreat integrity, and teamwork. (Exhibit A) The former supervisor also wrote that \nApplicant had no incidents or violations in handling classified information over a three-\nyear period while working overseas, nor did Applicant have any timecard issues. \n\n \n4 \n \nApplicant\u2019s current officer-in-charge, a chief warrant officer four in the U.S. Army, \ndescribed Applicant\u2019s duty performance as superb. (Exhibit B) His current project \nmanager and direct supervisor described Applicant as an expert in the field of satellite \ntechnologies and telecommunications. (Exhibit C) The supervisor also praised \nApplicant\u2019s work ethic and diligence in his timesheet recording and communication of \nwork performed. The supervisor concluded his letter by writing that Applicant is one of \nhis best employees. \n \nLaw and Policies \n \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (E.O.) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of \nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review \nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the National Security \nAdjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information or \nEligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position (AG), effective June 8, 2017. \n \nIt is well-established law that no one has a right to a security clearance.1 As \nnoted by the Supreme Court in Department of the Navy v. Egan, \u201cthe clearly consistent \nstandard indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the \nside of denials.\u201d2 Under Egan, Executive Order 10865, and the Directive, any doubt \nabout whether an applicant should be allowed access to classified information will be \nresolved in favor of protecting national security. In Egan, the Supreme Court stated that \nthe burden of proof is less than a preponderance of evidence.3 The Appeal Board has \nfollowed the Court\u2019s reasoning, and a judge\u2019s findings of fact are reviewed under the \nsubstantial-evidence standard.4 \n \n \nThere is no presumption in favor of granting, renewing, or continuing eligibility for \naccess to classified information.5 Under the Directive, the parties have the following \nburdens: (1) Department Counsel has the burden of presenting evidence to establish \nfacts alleged in the SOR that have been controverted; (2) an applicant is responsible for \npresenting evidence to refute, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts that have been \nadmitted or proven; and (3) an applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain \na favorable clearance decision.6 \n \n \n                                                          \n1 Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988) (\u201cit should be obvious that no one has a \n\u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance\u201d); Duane v. Department of Defense, 275 F.3d 988, 994 (10th Cir. 2002) (no \nright to a security clearance).  \n \n2 484 U.S. at 531. \n \n3 484 U.S. at 531. \n \n4 ISCR Case No. 01-20700 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002) (citations omitted). \n \n5 ISCR Case No. 02-18663 (App. Bd. Mar. 23, 2004). \n \n6 Directive, Enclosure 3, \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.14 and E.3.1.15. \n\n \n5 \n \nDiscussion \n \n \nUnder Guideline E, personal conduct involving questionable judgment, lack of \ncandor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise \nquestions about a person\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified or \nsensitive information. The concern is stated fully in AG \u00b6 15. \n \n \nIn analyzing the facts of this case, I considered the following disqualifying and \nmitigating conditions as most pertinent:  \n \nAG \u00b6 16(d) credible adverse information that is not explicitly covered \nunder any other guideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an \nadverse determination, but which, when combined with all the available \ninformation, supports a whole-person assessment of questionable \njudgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to \ncomply with rules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that \nthe individual may not properly safeguard classified or sensitive \ninformation. This includes, but is not limited to, consideration of: (1) \nuntrustworthy or unreliable behavior to include breach of client \nconfidentiality, release of proprietary information, unauthorized release of \nsensitive corporate or government protected information; (2) any \ndisruptive, violent, or other inappropriate behavior; (3) a pattern of \ndishonesty or rule violations; and (4) evidence of significant misuse of \ngovernment or other employer\u2019s time or resources; and   \n \nAG \u00b6 17(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the \nbehavior is so infrequent, or it happened under such unique \ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not case doubt on the \nindividual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.  \n \n \nAs set forth in the findings of fact, Applicant was fired from his job in February \n2015 due to intentional time mischarging. He does not dispute this fact. He certainly \nused questionable judgment in mischarging his time during December 2014-January \n2015 timeframe. His mischarging was serious enough to justify termination. The \nmischarging also qualifies as workplace misconduct sufficient to raise a concern under \nthe personal conduct guideline. \n \n \nIn mitigation, Applicant explained that the incident stemmed from his practice of \nworking more hours than the 40 hours he charged on the timesheet. He has worked for \ntwo employers since the 2015 termination, and he has been diligent in timesheet \nrecording and communication of work performed. (Exhibits A and C) Moving forward to \nSeptember 2018 when the evidentiary record closed, the incident is now more than \nthree years old, and there is no evidence of recurrence of similar conduct since the \nFebruary 2015 termination. The passage of time without recurrence weighs in \nApplicant\u2019s favor. On balance, I am persuaded that Applicant\u2019s workplace misconduct is \nmitigated as an isolated incident that occurred during a longtime career working in the \n\n \n6 \n \ndefense industry, it is unlikely to recur, and it does not cast doubt on his reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment. \n \n    \nFollowing Egan and the clearly consistent standard, I have no doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, good judgment, and ability to protect classified or \nsensitive information. In reaching this conclusion, I weighed the evidence as a whole \nand considered if the favorable evidence outweighed the unfavorable evidence or vice \nversa. I also considered the whole-person concept. I conclude that he met his ultimate \nburden of persuasion to show that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to \ngrant him eligibility for access to classified information.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nThe formal findings on the SOR allegations are: \n \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline E:  \n \nFor Applicant  \n \n  \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a and 1.b: \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIt is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for \naccess to classified information.

Foreman, Esq., Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro se \n______________ \nDecision \n______________ \nRICCIARDELLO, Carol G., Administrative Judge: \nApplicant mitigated the security concerns under Guideline B, foreign influence, but \nfailed to mitigate the security concerns under Guideline F, financial considerations. \nEligibility for access to classified information is denied.  \nStatement of the Case \nOn April 20, 2018, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications Facility \n(DOD CAF) issued to Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security \nconcerns under Guideline F, financial considerations and Guideline B, foreign influence. \nThe action was taken under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, \nDefense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as \namended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) effective within the DOD on \nJune 8, 2017.  \nApplicant answered the SOR on May 21, 2018, and requested a hearing before an \nadministrative judge. The case was assigned to me on December 11, 2018. The Defense \n02/06/2019\n\n \n2 \n \n \nOffice of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a notice of hearing on December 11, \n2018. I convened the hearing as scheduled on January 17, 2019. The Government \noffered exhibits (GE) 1 through 3. Applicant offered Applicant\u2019s Exhibits (AE) A through \nK. There were no objections to any exhibits, and they were admitted into evidence.1 \nDOHA received the hearing transcript on January 28, 2019.  \n \nRequest for Administrative Notice and Procedural Matters \n \n \nDepartment Counsel withdrew SOR \u00b6 1.c. Department Counsel submitted HE II, a \nwritten request that I take administrative notice of certain facts about the Philippines. \nApplicant did not object, and I have taken administrative notice of the facts contained in \nthe request that are supported by source documents from official U.S. Government \npublications.2  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant admitted the SOR allegations in \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b. He denied the allegation \nin SOR \u00b6 2.a. After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings, testimony, and exhibits \nsubmitted, I make the following findings of fact. \n \n \nApplicant is 51 years old. He earned an associate\u2019s degree in 1988. He was \nmarried and divorced twice from 1997 to 2003. There were no children from the \nmarriages. He remarried in 2012 and has children, ages five years old and 21 months. \nHe has worked for the same federal contractor since 1988.3 \n \n \nApplicant failed to timely file federal income tax returns for tax years 2007 through \n2016 and owed past-due federal income taxes.4  \n \n \nApplicant completed a security clearance application (SCA) in February 2015. He \ndisclosed that he failed to timely file his 2007, 2008, 2009, 2010 and 2011 federal income \ntax returns. He stated: \u201cI am currently working to file federal taxes for 2007.\u201d5 He repeated \nthis statement for each of the tax years he disclosed and stated he estimated owing $500 \nfor each year.

He testified he could not recall why he failed to disclose the other \ntax years. At that time his 2015 federal income tax return was not yet due.6  \n \n \nApplicant was interviewed by a government investigator in November 2015. He \ndisclosed that in September 2015 he filed his 2007 through 2011 federal income tax \nreturns. He explained that these tax returns were not timely filed because he was lazy \nand did not realize he owed money. He was unaware at that time of the total amount he \nowed, but stated that he would possibly set up a payment plan. He initially hired a \nprofessional tax consultant firm to help him, but it went bankrupt.7  \n \nApplicant testified that he mailed his 2007, 2008, and 2009 federal tax returns in \n2015 and he never heard back from the IRS and the returns were not processed. He said \nhe called the IRS frequently to find out the returns\u2019 status. 8 \n \n \nApplicant completed government interrogatories.9 In response to inquiries, he \nexplained that he failed to file his 2007 through 2011 federal income tax returns. He said \nhe did not realize at the time that he owed taxes. He stated: \u201cThere is not a real reason \nfor not filing other then I had been burning myself in my work.\u201d10 He stated he had met \nwith the IRS in December 2016 about negotiating a payment plan or settlement. There \nwas an error in his 2007 return so he was told it needed to be corrected and resubmitted. \nHe explained his plan was to hire a tax attorney to complete his taxes, resubmit his 2007 \nreturn and negotiate a settlement. He provided the first page of his 2008, 2009 and 2010 \nIRS 1040 forms that only included his income and no other information. They were \nstamped by the IRS on December 13, 2016.11 \n \n \nApplicant completed additional government interrogatories in April 2018. He \nexplained he submitted tax documents to the IRS three weeks prior to his government \ninterview, but the IRS had not received his submission. He resubmitted tax documents in \nperson at an IRS office. He said all of his tax documents were accepted except for tax \nyear 2007 because it was missing a document. He resubmitted it, and he said his 2007 \ntax return was being processed to determine his tax liability. Applicant provided the first \n                                                          \n6 Tr. 28-30; GE 1. I have not considered any derogatory information that was not alleged in the SOR for \ndisqualifying purposes. I may consider such information when making a credibility determination, in the \napplication of mitigating conditions, and in a whole-person analysis.  \n \n7 GE 3. \n \n8 Tr. 32. \n \n9 Applicant dated his response to the Government\u2019s August 2016 interrogatories as October 11, 2016. \nHowever, in his narrative response he provided dates he made contact with the IRS as December 2016, \nwhich would have occurred after the date he signed his interrogatories.  \n \n10 GE 2. \n \n11 Tr. 34-35; GE 2. \n\n \n4 \n \n \npage of his 2007 IRS 1040 that was stamped on January 24, 2016. The second page \nshows that it was prepared on January 19, 2018, by a tax preparer.12  \n \n \nIRS transcripts confirmed that Applicant submitted a 2007 IRS 1040 form in \nJanuary 2016, and it was filed in January 2018. Substitute tax returns were prepared by \nthe IRS for tax year 2008 in May 2010 and for tax year 2009 in August 2011. Applicant \nsubmitted his federal income tax returns to the IRS for tax year 2010 in December 2016; \ntax years 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014, 2015, and 2016 were all filed in January 2018. \nApplicant\u2019s annual income for tax years 2008 to 2016 ranged from $98,000 to $130,000. \nHe was not married in 2007 through 2011.13  \n \n \nApplicant testified that he was dedicated to his work and did not practice due \ndiligence in timely completing his federal income tax returns. He said he had been working \nwith a professional tax consultant firm in 2012, but it went bankrupt. He said after that he \nwas missing documents. He understood he had a duty to file his tax returns. He kept \ngetting busy and delayed filing his tax returns. He said he was unable to retrieve from the \nIRS tax transcripts for 2007 and 2008, because they were too old. He said the reason he \nfailed to timely file his 2011 through 2016 federal tax returns was because he was trying \nto get a tax number for his wife. He was told by the IRS that he was due refunds for certain \ntax years, and he should wait for all of the delinquent years to be processed. Applicant \ntestified that refunds he was entitled to for tax years 2012 through 2016, were applied to \nthe federal income taxes he owed for tax years 2006, 2007, and 2008. In May 2018, he \nwithdrew money from his pension plan, paid the penalty, and paid the federal income \ntaxes he owed for tax years 2009, 2010 and 2011. Applicant provided an IRS document \nthat shows he has a zero balance as of January 2019.14 \n \n \nApplicant was asked if he had timely filed his 2017 federal income tax return, which \nwas due on April 15, 2018. He did not. He stated he filed it about three weeks before his \nhearing. He did not file an extension. He did not have an explanation for his failure to \ntimely file his 2017 federal income tax return. He stated \u201cIt was a credit, I didn\u2019t owe\u201d. He \ntestified that he promised he would file his tax returns on time in the future.15  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s mother-in-law was born in the Philippines. She became a permanent \nresident of the United States in September 2015. She was sponsored by Applicant\u2019s \nwife\u2019s sister and her husband, who are U.S. citizens. Applicant\u2019s mother-in-law has \nreturned to the Philippines for several months since acquiring her permanent resident \nstatus, but has not returned there since 2017. She works as a child care provider and is \n                                                          \n12 GE 3. \n \n13 Tr. 36-38; AE D through K. \n \n14 Tr. 25, 39-48; AE C.  \n \n15 Tr. 48-51. \n \n\n \n5 \n \n \nself-sufficient. Applicant and his wife do not provide her financial support. Applicant\u2019s \nmother-in-law has family that lives in the Philippines.16 \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility, the administrative judge \nmust consider the AG. In addition to brief introductory explanations for each guideline, \nthe adjudicative guidelines list potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating \nconditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified \ninformation. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere \nspeculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 states an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\u201d  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \n                                                          \n16 Tr. 52-78; AE A, B. \n\n \n6 \n \n \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for financial considerations is set out \nin AG & 18:  \n \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \n \nAG \u00b6 19 provides conditions that could raise security concerns. The following are \npotentially applicable:  \n \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and  \n \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired.  \n \n \nApplicant failed to timely file federal income tax returns for tax years 2007 through \n2016. He owed a substantial tax debt that was past due. There is sufficient evidence to \nsupport the application of the above disqualifying conditions. \n \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising \nfrom financial difficulties. The following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially \napplicable: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n \n\n \n7 \n \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control;  \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and  \n \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority \nto file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \n \n \nApplicant failed to timely file federal income tax returns for ten years. He owed a \nsignificant tax debt. He completed an SCA in February 2015 and disclosed some of the \ntax years he failed to file returns, but not all of them. After being put on notice about that \nhis failure to timely file tax returns was a security concern, he failed to timely file his 2016 \nand 2017 federal income tax return. Applicant owed federal income taxes for numerous \ntax years that were not paid until May 2018. There is insufficient evidence to conclude \nthat his behavior is unlikely to recur. Applicant\u2019s repeated failure to pay his federal taxes \nand file his federal income tax returns casts doubt on his current reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and good judgment. AG \u00b6 20(a) does not apply. \n \n \nApplicant attributed his failure to timely file his federal income tax returns to being \nlazy and working hard. He did not think he owed taxes. He also attributed his failure to \ntimely file during the later years to not having a tax number for his wife. These factors did \nnot impact Applicant\u2019s ability to comply with tax laws and obligations. These factors were \nnot beyond Applicant\u2019s control. Even if he could not obtain a tax number for his wife for \none year, it does not explain why this was not corrected in subsequent years. It also did \nnot prevent him from filing his tax returns. Applicant\u2019s eventual resolution of his delinquent \ntax filings and payment of his overdue taxes years after they were due does not show he \nacted responsibly. Even after he was put on notice about the security concerns, he did \nnot act responsibly. AG \u00b6 20(b) does not apply. \n \n \nApplicant has filed his delinquent federal income tax returns and paid his past-due \nfederal taxes. AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(c) and 20(g) apply. I cannot find that Applicant\u2019s eventual \npayment of his federal income taxes years after they were due and only after his security \nclearance became an issue constitutes a good-faith effort to resolve his debts. AG \u00b6 20(d) \ndoes not apply. \n \n \n\n \n8 \n \n \nGuideline B: Foreign Influence \n \nAG \u00b6 6 expresses the security concern regarding foreign influence:  \n \nForeign contacts and interests, including, but not limited to, business, \nfinancial, and property interests, are a national security concern if they \nresulted in divided allegiance. They may also be a national security concern \nif they create circumstances in which the individual may be manipulated or \ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a \nway inconsistent with U.S. interests or otherwise made vulnerable to \npressure or coercion by any foreign interest. Assessment of foreign contacts \nand interests should consider the country in which the foreign contact or \ninterest is located, including, but not limited to, considerations such as \nwhether it is known to target U.S. citizens to obtain classified or sensitive \ninformation or is it associated with a risk of terrorism.  \n \nAG \u00b6 7 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. I have considered all of them and the following are potentially applicable: \n \n(a) contact, regardless of method, with a foreign family member, business \nor professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or \nresident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of \nforeign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; and  \n \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual\u2019s obligation to \nprotect classified or sensitive information or technology and the individual\u2019s \ndesire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing that \ninformation. \n \nAG \u00b6 7(a) requires evidence of a \u201cheightened risk.\u201d The \u201cheightened risk\u201d required \nto raise this disqualifying conditions is a relatively low standard. \u201cHeightened risk\u201d denotes \na risk greater than the normal risk inherent in having a family member living under a \nforeign government or owning property in a foreign country. The totality of Applicant\u2019s \nfamily ties to a foreign country as well as each individual family tie must be considered.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s mother-in-law is a citizen of the Philippines and has been permanent \nresident of the United States since 2015. She was sponsored by Applicant\u2019s sister-in-law \nand brother-in-law. His mother-in-law is employed in the United States and is self-\nsufficient. I do not find there is a heightened risk or a potential for foreign influence. I find \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 7(a) and 7(b) do not apply. I find in Applicant\u2019s favor under the Guideline B security \nconcerns.  \n \n \n \n \n\n \n9 \n \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.  \n       \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuidelines F and B in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were \naddressed under those guidelines, but some warrant additional comment. \n \nApplicant is 51 years old. His mother-in-law is a citizen of the Philippines and a \npermanent resident of the United States since 2015. She lives in the U.S., is employed, \nand is self-sufficient. I did not find any disqualifying conditions applied and find in \nApplicant\u2019s favor under Guideline B, foreign influence.  \n \nApplicant has been employed by the same federal contractor since 1986. He failed \nto timely file his 2007 through 2016 federal income tax returns. Even after he was aware \nof the seriousness of his conduct in 2015, he failed to timely file his federal income tax \nreturns for 2016 and again in 2017. The fact that years later he finally completed his legal \nobligations does not show he exercises good judgment and is reliable. The DOHA Appeal \nBoard has held that:  \n \nSomeone who fails repeatedly to fulfill his or her legal obligations does not \ndemonstrate the high degree of good judgment and reliability required of \nthose granted access to classified information. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. \n14-01894 at 5 (App. Bd. August 18, 2015). See Cafeteria & Restaurant \nWorkers Union Local 473 v. McElroy, 284 F.2d 173, 183 (D.C. Cir. 1960), \naff\u2019d, 367 U.S. 886 (1961). 17 \n \n                                                          \n17 ISCR Case No. 12-10933 at 3 (App. Bd. June 29, 2016). \n\n \n10 \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s history of non-compliance with a fundamental legal obligation to timely \nfile and pay his federal income taxes raises serious security concerns. The record \nevidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability \nfor a security clearance. For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant failed to mitigate the \nsecurity concerns arising under Guideline F, financial considerations.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.b: \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph   1.c:  \n \nWithdrawn \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline B:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national security to grant Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security \nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nCarol G.

Petcher, Esq., Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro se \n______________ \nDecision \n______________ \nMATCHINSKI, Elizabeth M., Administrative Judge: \nApplicant has made no progress toward resolving a home-equity credit line that was \ncharged off for $37,193 in February 2015 or on a line of credit that was charged off for \n$4,482 in October 2014. As of May 2018, he had made some payments toward a collection \ndebt, but more progress is needed in addressing his delinquencies. Clearance is denied. \nStatement of the Case \nOn January 9, 2018, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications Facility \n(DOD CAF) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant, detailing security concerns \nunder Guideline F, financial considerations. The SOR explained why the DOD CAF was \nunable to find it clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue security \nclearance eligibility for him. The DOD CAF took the action under Executive Order (EO) \n10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as \namended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review \nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the National Security Adjudicative \nGuidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information or Eligibility to \nHold a Sensitive Position (AG) effective within the DOD on June 8, 2017. \n09/28/2018\n\n2 \n \nApplicant responded to the SOR on January 29, 2018, and requested a hearing \nbefore an administrative judge from the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA). \nOn April 18, 2018, the case was assigned to me to conduct a hearing to determine whether \nit is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for \nApplicant. On April 24, 2018, I scheduled a hearing for May 18, 2018. With the agreement \nof the parties, I changed the start time of the hearing and issued an Amended Notice of \nHearing on May 10, 2018. \n \nAt the hearing, four Government exhibits (GEs 1-4) were admitted. A March 7, 2018 \nletter forwarding the proposed GEs to Applicant and a list of the GEs were marked as \nhearing exhibits (HEs I-II) for the record but not admitted in evidence. Applicant testified at \nthe hearing, as reflected in a hearing transcript (Tr.) received on June 6, 2018. \n \nI held the record open for one month for evidentiary documents from Applicant. On \nMay 25, 2018, Applicant submitted AEs A-F, which were accepted into the record without \nany objection from the Government but with some concern over the weight to be afforded \nextracts of credit reports because they do not fully reflect Applicant\u2019s financial status. \n \nSummary of SOR Allegations and Answer \n \n \nThe SOR alleges under Guideline F that, as of January 9, 2018, Applicant owed \ncharged-off debts of $37, 193 (SOR \u00b6 1.a) and $4,482 (SOR \u00b6 1.b); a $786 collection debt \n(SOR \u00b6 1.c); a $262 wireless telephone debt in collection (SOR \u00b6 1.d); and three medical \ncollection debts totaling $419 (SOR \u00b6 1.g). When Applicant answered the SOR allegations, \nhe admitted the debts.1 He indicated that he was currently enrolled in repayment plans for \nthe collection debts. Concerning the charged-off debts held by a bank, he explained that he \nand his spouse recalled obtaining a ten-year home-equity loan with a corresponding line of \ncredit (SOR \u00b6 1.a) but the bank now holding the debt has indicated that the account \u201chad \nturned into a 30 year loan,\u201d which became six months in arrears pending his fraud claim. \nThe bank demanded that he pay the arrearage in full or obtain a restructuring of the loan. \nAfter his application for a loan modification was denied, the bank indicated it would \nproceed with foreclosure to close the account. Advised by a credit counseling service that a \nsecond mortgage would not cause him to lose his home, Applicant reapplied for a \nmodification that was denied. He denied receiving any correspondence about the debt \nsince April 2015 but indicated that he would pay off the debt on the sale of his home in \nwhich he has equity exceeding $120,000. (Answer.) \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nAfter considering the pleadings, exhibits, and transcript, I make the following \nfindings of fact. \n \nApplicant is 60 years old and a high school graduate. He has worked for his current \nemployer, a defense contractor, since March 2008. He has been at his present duty \n                                                 \n1 Applicant addressed each of the debts in his answer, but his paragraph designations do not match those of \nthe SOR of record. \n\n3 \n \nlocation since September 2011 and provides program management support. He previously \nworked for another defense contractor from 1983 to February 2008 and has held a \nclearance since September 1983. He was granted sensitive compartmented information \n(SCI) eligibility in 2003. (GEs 1, 2; Tr. 29-30.) He currently holds a secret clearance. (Tr. \n36.) \n \nApplicant and his spouse married in January 1985. They have one child, a son now \nage 33. Applicant has a 35-year-old daughter from a previous relationship while his spouse \nhas a 39-year-old daughter from her previous marriage. (GE 1; Tr. 34.) Applicant\u2019s spouse \nworked during their marriage until 2002, when Applicant became legal guardian to his \ngrandson, then an infant. (Tr. 34-35.) Applicant\u2019s spouse manages the finances in their \nhousehold. (Tr. 58.) \n \nIn September 2004, Applicant purchased a new home for his family. (GEs 1-2.) He \nobtained a 30-year mortgage for $219,900, to be repaid at $1,831 per month. Within a year \nor so, Applicant opened a secured line of credit (SOR \u00b6 1.a) to finish the basement.2 (GEs \n3-4; Tr. 22, 50.) Over the course of the next five years, he borrowed approximately \n$32,000. (Tr. 51, 68.) \n \nApplicant and his spouse\u2019s son was wounded while serving in Iraq in September \n2007. He was medically evacuated to a hospital in Europe before returning to his home in \nanother state. In February 2008, Applicant and his spouse relocated to their son\u2019s area to \nhelp him with his recovery. In March 2008, Applicant began working as a contractor for his \npresent employer on a U.S. military base at $83,000 a year, about $2,000 less than his \nprevious salary. His household expenses increased significantly. He and his spouse rented \na house at $1,200 a month in their new area while continuing to pay the mortgage on their \nprevious residence, which was occupied by Applicant\u2019s daughter and her two children. \nApplicant\u2019s daughter, who was a waitress, contributed \u201croughly $800\u201d a month, about half \nof the monthly mortgage payment on the home. (Tr. 20-21, 30-32.) Applicant\u2019s spouse \nmade the mortgage payments on time through July 2009. Applicant\u2019s loan was past due 30 \ndays when it was transferred shortly thereafter to a new loan servicer. The new loan \nservicer failed to withdraw the mortgage payment from their bank account, and their loan \nwas placed into a government program, which increased the balance of the loan to \n$231,520. (GEs 3-4; Tr. 22.) \n \nIn May 2011, Applicant\u2019s daughter vacated Applicant\u2019s house, and Applicant\u2019s \nspouse and grandson returned home in June 2011. (Tr. 32-33.) As of August 2011, \nApplicant and his spouse had an open line of credit for $5,000 (SOR \u00b6 1.b) as overdraft \nprotection for the home-equity line of credit in SOR \u00b6 1.a. Monthly payments on the \naccount were $143. (GE 3.) After a job opportunity at the same salary surfaced for his \nemployer in his current location, Applicant moved back home in September 2011. (Tr. 32-\n33.) \n \n                                                 \n2 Applicant testified that he obtained a home-equity line of credit in 2005 with a small community bank, and it \nwas later transferred to the bank identified in SOR \u00b6 1.a. (Tr. 50.) Available credit reports show an opening \ndate of August 2007 with the bank listed in SOR \u00b6 1.a. (GEs 3-4.) \n\n4 \n \nIn August 2013, Applicant\u2019s spouse was diagnosed with cancer and began incurring \nmedical bills that strained their finances. (Tr. 33-34.) While Applicant had health insurance, \nhe had a $9,000 deductible to cover any medical copayments. (Tr. 39-40.) Over the next \ntwo years, Applicant and his spouse paid $11,000 to $12,000 toward her medical \nexpenses. He also lost income because he was unable to travel during his spouse\u2019s \ntreatments. (Tr. 40.) \n \nAfter November 2013, Applicant and his spouse stopped paying on the home-equity \nloan in SOR \u00b6 1.a. When they were billed for two months of payments (approximately \n$886), Applicant contacted the bank holding the debt and was informed that the loan had \nbeen converted to a 30-year second mortgage and that he was in default. He had paid on \nthe secured line of credit for several years and disputed the terms claimed by the bank. \nOver the next five months, the balance continued to accrue because of nonpayment. \nApplicant assumed he was a victim of predatory lending. Applicant learned that the \nconversion to a 30-year loan was in the terms of his original contract. Not knowing how to \nproceed and unable to pay the full balance of the debt, Applicant contacted the bank. On \nits advice, he applied for a 30-year mortgage to address the delinquent secured line of \ncredit, only to be denied. When he indicated that he could not pay the full balance, he was \ntold that a lien would be placed against his home. In February 2015, the bank charged off \nthe account for $37,193 and placed a lien on his home. (GEs 3-4; Tr. 23, 52-56.) \n \nIn March 2014, Applicant and his spouse stopped paying on the line of credit \nobtained in July 2011 (SOR \u00b6 1.b) that was held by the same bank as the secured home-\nequity loan. In October 2014, the bank charged off a balance of $4,482. (GEs 3-4.) \n \nApplicant missed one payment on his primary mortgage because of a lack of funds. \nHe then made regular payments on his mortgage, but his account was chronically 30 days \npast due in 2014 and 2015 because he could not afford to make a double payment. (GEs \n2-4.) \n \nIn July 2015, Applicant leased a 2015 model-year truck, taking on an $18,991 debt \nto be repaid at $486 per month. In December 2015, he obtained a $12,795 car loan for a \n2011 model-year small sport utility vehicle for his spouse. Monthly payments on the loan \nare $248. (GEs 3-4; Tr. 59, 65-66.) \n \nOn February 24, 2016, Applicant completed and certified to the accuracy of a \nQuestionnaire for National Positions (SF 86). In response to financial record inquiries \nconcerning any delinquency involving routine accounts, Applicant indicated that he owed \n$35,000 in credit card and second mortgage debt because of medical bills. (GE 1.) \n \nA check of Applicant\u2019s credit on April 12, 2016, showed that, in addition to the \ncharged-off balances of $37,193 (SOR \u00b6 1.a) and $4,482 (SOR \u00b6 1.b) on the lines of \ncredit, medical debts of $150 from June 2014 (SOR \u00b61.e), $150 from March 2015 (SOR \u00b6 \n1.f), and $119 from April 2013 (SOR \u00b6 1.g) were in collection. Applicant or his spouse was \nmaking payments on a closed credit card account with a $1,780 balance, on the auto lease \nwith a $15,096 balance and loan with a $12,590 balance, and on open credit card accounts \n\n5 \n \nwith balances of $5,250 and $142. (GE 3.) A more recent credit report of November 27, \n2017, revealed that a $786 consumer credit debt was placed for collection (SOR \u00b6 1.c) in \nNovember 2015. As of April 2017, a cellphone debt of $262 from September 2016 was in \ncollection (SOR \u00b6 1.d). A credit card opened in November 2003 with Applicant as an \nauthorized user was charged off for $1,827 in 2013 (not alleged). (GE 4.) \n \nIn May 2017, Applicant had a medical issue that required his hospitalization for a \nmonth. He was out of work until August 2017, and his short-term disability income was \n60% of his regular income. (Tr. 26-27.) Applicant incurred approximately $10,000 in out-of-\npocket medical expenses in addition to the income loss for being unable to travel for work. \n(Tr. 41.) \n \n \nOn August 16, 2017, Applicant was interviewed by an authorized investigator for the \nOffice of Personnel Management (OPM). He acknowledged that he could owe as much as \n$40,000 on the secured line of credit, which he actively disputed until 2015 on the basis \nthat it was a ten-year loan, not the 30-year loan claimed by the bank. He had not received \nany correspondence about the account since 2015 and had not paid anything toward the \ndebt. He expressed an intention to make payments on the account if he receives \ninformation on the account. Applicant volunteered that he missed two payments on a \nMasterCard account that was charged off for approximately $700 and could be in \ncollections. He did not know the current status of the account but would pay it if contacted \nby the creditor. When confronted with other adverse credit information on his record, \nApplicant indicated about the medical collection debt on his record that he could have \noverlooked some medical bills from his spouse\u2019s cancer treatments, but he did not recall \nany specifics. When asked about his late payments on his primary mortgage, Applicant \nrelated that after he missed one payment, he was always one month behind because he \ncould not make a double payment. However, he indicated that he brought the loan current \nin 2017. Applicant did not recognize the $1,827 delinquency on his credit record. As for the \n$4,482 charged-off credit line, Applicant explained that it was for overdraft protection of the \nsecured line of credit account, and that it was charged off. Applicant related that his current \nfinancial status was positive, and he did not anticipate any future financial issues. (GE 2.) \n \n \nAs of September 2017, Applicant was one month behind on his $1,711 monthly \npayment of his primary mortgage. (GE 4.) He fell behind last year because of his loss of \nincome, registration costs for both vehicles, and the expense of having to put new tires and \nbrakes on his truck. He has been consistently one month behind since then. (Tr. 60.)  A \ncredit card account with a current balance of $252 had been delinquent as recently as \nJune 2017. Applicant was making timely payments for his and his spouse\u2019s car loan \nbalances of $9,455 and $5,843. He was also making timely payments on his credit card \nwith a home improvement retailer, which had a balance of $4,339. (GE 4.) \n \n \nAs of May 2018, Applicant had made no payments on the charged-off line of credit \n(SOR \u00b6 1.a) or its overdraft protection account (SOR \u00b6 1.b), which were closed with \nreported outstanding balances of $37,193 and $4,482. (AE C.) He testified that he intends \nto repay those debts when he sells his home and that he has no choice in that regard. (Tr. \n23-24, 56.) Applicant testified that he received a 1099 form from the bank in 2017, but he \n\n6 \n \n\u201ccould not trace it\u201d because the amount does not correspond to information that he has \nabout the account. (Tr. 57-58.)  He reported the amount as income on his tax return and \nincurred a federal tax underpayment of $1,100. He was expecting a state tax refund of \n$1,300 that he planned to use to satisfy his federal tax liability. (Tr. 61.) As for consumer \ncredit card accounts, Applicant stated that five collection entities are currently taking \nbetween $40 and $60 a month from his checking account.3  (Tr. 24, 44.) Applicant believed \nthat one of his debts (SOR \u00b6 1.c) was being actively collected at $37 a month. After he \nreceived the SOR, he contacted the creditor holding the debt and made a payment in late \nJanuary 2018, which reduced the balance to $742. (AE B; Tr. 43.) He did not realize until \nMay 2018 that he failed to authorize recurring payment. He corrected the issue to repay the \ndebt at $37 a month from May 2018 through December 2019. (AEs A, D.) Applicant \nbelieves that the medical accounts and the wireless phone debt are paid \u201cas noted by the \nabsence of these accounts in the collections section\u201d on his credit report. He testified that, \nin November 2017, he made repayment arrangements with an entity now collecting the \nwireless phone debt, and that he is repaying the debt at $60 a month from his account with \na credit union. (Tr. 46-47.) Information from Credit Karma indicates the wireless phone \ncollection account (SOR \u00b6 1.d) has been closed with an outstanding balance of $200 as of \nlate May 2018. (AE C.) There is no documentation confirming payments toward the \nmedical collection debts, although Applicant stated that he began making $40 monthly \npayments toward the debts after he received the SOR. (Tr. 48.) With regard to the timing of \nhis debt repayments, Applicant stated: \n \nI didn\u2019t have any more money available. I realized the importance of the \nimpact of some of these bills. I wasn\u2019t ignoring them. I was paying other bills. \nI didn\u2019t want anything else to get onto the credit report. I decided to pay \nthem. (Tr. 49.) \n \n \nApplicant testified to his belief that the $119 medical collection debt (SOR 1.g) has \nbeen paid (Tr. 49), although he provided no corroborating documentation. Since January \n2018, he and his spouse have less than $100 in discretionary income each month. (Tr. 58.) \nHe had $2,500 to $3,000 in his checking account as of mid-May 2018 because he had just \nbeen paid. (Tr. 62.) \n \n \nApplicant and his spouse have been raising his grandson (age 15 as of May 2018) \nsince infancy. Applicant has expenses for his grandson\u2019s driving school, competitive \narchery training, and high school activities, in addition to necessities such as food and \nclothing. Applicant\u2019s spouse is currently unemployed and has not worked since 2002. (Tr. \n25, 34.) She finished her cancer treatment in 2016. (Tr. 26.) Applicant\u2019s current salary is \n$93,000 a year. (Tr. 37.) Since 2014 or 2015, he has had retirement income of $1,300 a \nmonth from his previous job. He applied for the disbursement when his spouse was under \nmedical treatment. (Tr. 63.) He has accumulated $7,000 in a 401(k) with his current \nemployer. Applicant\u2019s spouse has $12,000 in a retirement account. (Tr. 64.) Before his own \nmedical problem in May 2017, he traveled for work and had per diem income that \naugmented his salary by $10,000 a year on average. Applicant expects to resume traveling \n                                                 \n3 Applicant had been repaying some debts not alleged in the SOR. (Tr. 43-44.) \n\n7 \n \nfor work in the near future. (Tr. 37-39.) He described his financial situation as \u201cthe worst it\u2019s \nbeen in 30 years, but it\u2019s getting better.\u201d (Tr. 64-65.) \n \nPolicies \n \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion the Executive \nBranch has in regulating access to information pertaining to national security,  emphasizing \nthat \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 \nU.S. 518, 528 (1988). When evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, \nthe administrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are required to be considered in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. These guidelines \nare not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, \nthese guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative \nprocess. The administrative judge\u2019s overall adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious \nscrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative \njudge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, \nfavorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence \nto establish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant \nis responsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation about potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Section 7 of EO 10865 \nprovides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a \ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section \n3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information). \n\n8 \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \n \n \nThe security concerns about financial considerations are articulated in AG \u00b6 18: \n \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness \nto abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about an \nindividual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified or \nsensitive information. Financial distress can also be caused or exacerbated \nby, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other issues of personnel security \nconcern such as excessive gambling, mental health conditions, substance \nmisuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An individual who is financially \noverextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or otherwise \nquestionable acts to generate funds. . . . \n \n \nThe Appeal Board explained the scope and rationale for the financial considerations \nsecurity concern in ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012) (citation omitted) \nas follows: \n \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an applicant might knowingly \ncompromise classified information in order to raise money in satisfaction of \nhis or her debts. Rather, it requires a Judge to examine the totality of an \napplicant\u2019s financial history and circumstances. The Judge must consider \npertinent evidence regarding the applicant\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other \nqualities essential to protecting the national secrets as well as the \nvulnerabilities inherent in the circumstances. The Directive presumes a \nnexus between proven conduct under any of the Guidelines and an \napplicant\u2019s security eligibility. \n \nApplicant is not required to be debt free, but he is required to manage his finances \nin a way to exhibit sound judgment and responsibility. Debts that have been charged off or \nplaced for collection raise financial considerations security concerns. Applicant became \ndelinquent on a secured line of credit account and an associated overdraft protection \naccount while his spouse was undergoing treatment for a serious illness diagnosed in \nAugust 2013. He had no success in restructuring the debt or obtaining a new loan to \naddress the delinquency, and balances of $37,193 and $4,482 were respectively charged \noff in February 2015 and October 2014. A $786 credit card delinquency was placed for \ncollection in November 2015 due to nonpayment since February 2014. A wireless \ntelephone debt of $262, and three medical debts totaling $419 were placed for collection. \nDisqualifying conditions AG \u00b6 19(a), \u201cinability to satisfy debts,\u201d and \u00b6 19(c), \u201ca history of not \nmeeting financial obligations,\u201d apply. \n \nThe burden is on Applicant to mitigate the evidence of financial delinquency. One or \nmore of the following conditions under AG \u00b6 20 may apply: \n\n9 \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under \nsuch circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the \nindividual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem from a \nlegitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit counseling service, \nand there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under \ncontrol; \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(a) does not apply. With the possible exception of the wireless services \ndebt, which had some activity on the account in September 2016, the debts became past \ndue three to four years ago. The delinquencies were not recently incurred. However, they \nhad not been resolved as of the issuance of the SOR in January 2018. The Appeal Board \nrecently affirmed that unresolved debts are a continuing course of conduct. See ISCR \nCase No. 17-03146 at 2 (App. Bd. Jul. 31, 2018) (citing ISCR Case No. 15-08799 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Nov. 3, 2017)). \n \nApplicant has a credible case for some mitigation under AG \u00b6 20(b). Between 2008 \nand 2011, Applicant and his spouse continued to pay the mortgage on their home while \nrenting separate housing near their son, who had been injured in Iraq. Applicant\u2019s \ndaughter, who moved into the home while they were away, could only afford half the \nmonthly mortgage obligation. Their monthly housing expense went from $1,600 to $2,000 \n(half the mortgage plus their rent of $1,200). Applicant\u2019s spouse\u2019s serious illness, \ndiagnosed in August 2013, was an unforeseen circumstance that further compromised the \nfamily\u2019s finances. Over the next two years, Applicant and his spouse paid $11,000 to \n$12,000 toward her medical expenses. Applicant lost income of approximately $10,000 on \naverage a year because he was unable to travel during his spouse\u2019s treatments. The \nsecured line of credit, the overdraft protection account, and the $150 medical debts \nbecame delinquent during that time.  More recently, Applicant had a medical problem in \nMay 2017 that led to a loss of 40% in income over the short term and additional medical \nexpenses. It continues to have an impact in that he has been unable to travel for work. \n\n10 \n \nEven if Applicant\u2019s financial difficulties initially arose, in whole or in part, due to \ncircumstances outside of his control, I have to consider whether Applicant acted in a \nreasonable manner when dealing with his financial difficulties. See ISCR Case No. 05-\n11366 at 4, n.9 (App. Bd. Jan. 12, 2007) (citing ISCR Case No. 99-0462 at 4 (App. Bd. \nMay 25, 2000); ISCR Case No. 99-0012 at 4 (App. Bd. Dec. 1, 1999); ISCR Case No. 03-\n13096 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 29, 2005)). A component is whether Applicant maintained \ncontact with his creditors and attempted to negotiate partial payments to keep debts \ncurrent. Applicant has had retirement income of $1,300 per month for the past two years. It \nis difficult to find that Applicant acted fully responsibly toward his creditors when he did \nlittle, if anything, to address his delinquencies in 2016 and 2017. Applicant submits that he \nwas paying other debts, but the evidence also shows that he took on car payments totaling \n$734 per month in 2015 while collection debts went unpaid. Applicant did not recognize the \nmedical debts when confronted about them during his subject interview, but he knew that \nhe had at least one delinquent credit card account (SOR \u00b6 1.c) that he believed was in \ncollections for $700. He ignored the debt until it was clear that it became an issue for his \nsecurity clearance eligibility. \n \nAGs \u00b6\u00b6 20(c) and 20(d) have minimal applicability. Applicant presented \ndocumentation showing that he has a repayment plan established for the debt in SOR \u00b6 \n1.c showing a payment of $37 on the same day as his security clearance hearing. He \nindicates that he also made a payment in late January 2018, and available credit reports \nshow some reduction in the balance from $786 in November 2017 to $742 in May 2018. \nApplicant submits that the medical and wireless phone debts in collection have been paid \nbecause they are not listed in the collections section on his May 2018 credit report. The \nAppeal Board stated in ISCR Case No. 16-01338, decided on July 13, 2018: \n \nAs we have previously stated, a credit report, in and of itself, may not be \nsufficient to meet an applicant\u2019s burden of persuasion as to mitigation, \ninsofar as it provides little evidence regarding the underlying circumstances \nof the debt. Moreover, the fact that a debt no longer appears on a credit \nreport does not establish a meaningful, independent evidence as to the \ndisposition of the debt. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 14-03612 at 3 (App. Bd. \nAug. 25, 2015). For example, debts may fall off credit reports merely due to \nthe passage of time. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 03-20327 at 6 (App. Bd. Oct \n26, 2006). \n \nApplicant presented only part of his May 2018 credit report. Even so, it shows that \nthe wireless phone account, now closed, has a $200 balance. The medical debts are not \nlisted. He testified that he made $40 monthly payments toward the $300 in medical \ncollection debt (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.e and 1.f) after he received the SOR, but he presented no \npayment records. He made no progress toward resolving the $37,193 and $4,483 charged-\noff debts. Applicant asserts an intention to repay the debts when he sells his home \nbecause the bank has a lien against his property. The Appeal Board has consistently held \nthat a promise to pay a debt in the future is not a substitute for a track record of paying \ndebts in a timely manner. See e.g., ISCR Case No. 09-05390 at 2 (App. Bd. Oct. 22, \n2010). While Applicant testified that he received a 1099 form for $9,999 from the creditor in \n\n11 \n \n2017, and that he reported it on his income tax returns, the form itself is not in evidence, \nand he could not explain it. Neither AG \u00b6 20(c) nor AG \u00b6 20(d) applies to the charged-off \ndebts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b. \n \nAG \u00b6 20(e) was not established. Applicant asserted that he paid on the account in \nSOR \u00b6 1.a for several years before he fell behind. He disputed the terms of the account in \nthat the bank converted it to a mortgage loan, but he learned that it was allowed under the \nterms of the contract. \n \nApplicant is not required to pay off every one of his past-due debts before he can be \ngranted security clearance eligibility. However, some concerns persist about his financial \nstability. His home mortgage was past due 30 days in March 2017 before his medical issue \nin May 2017. His short-term disability in the summer of 2017 explains why he was past due \n30 days on his mortgage in August 2017, but he was again 30 days past due on his \nmortgage from January 2018 to May 2018. He had vehicle expenses in late 2017 that may \nnot have been discretionary and caused some financial strain. His retirement income of \n$1,300 is more than ample to cover his car payments. He did not adequately explain or \ndocument why he has been unable to catch up on his mortgage payments in 2018 when \nhe is earning $93,000 in base salary with a defense contractor. More progress is needed \ntoward resolving the past-due debts to mitigate the financial considerations security \nconcerns. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \nIn assessing the whole person, the administrative judge must consider the totality of \nan applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant circumstances in light of the nine adjudicative \nprocess factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). The analysis under Guideline F is incorporated in my whole-\nperson analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were addressed under that guideline, but \nsome warrant additional comment. \n \n \nThe security clearance adjudication involves an evaluation of an applicant\u2019s \njudgment, reliability, and trustworthiness in light of the security guidelines in the Directive. \nSee ISCR Case No. 09-02160 (App. Bd. Jun. 21, 2010). It is not a proceeding designed to \ncollect debts. At the same time, it is well settled that once a concern arises regarding an \napplicant\u2019s security clearance eligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or \nrenewal of a security clearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th Cir. \n1990). Applicant obtained a secured line of credit without fully understanding the terms of \nthe contract, but this does not excuse him from his contractual liability. Based on the \nevidence presented, I am unable to conclude that it is clearly consistent with the national \ninterest to continue Applicant\u2019s security clearance eligibility at this time. \n\n12 \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.g: \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances, it is not clearly consistent with the national \ninterest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance. Eligibility for \naccess to classified information is denied. \n \n \n_____________________ \nElizabeth M. Matchinski \nAdministrative Judge \n",

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant is 36 years old. He is employed by a defense contractor as a Protective Security Officer. He is seeking to retain a security clearance in connection with his employment. Applicant began working for his current employer in September 2015. Guideline G \u2013 Alcohol Consumption The Government alleges that the Applicant has engaged in excessive alcohol consumption, which often leads to the exercise of questionable judgment or the failure to control impulses, and can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness. Applicant admits each of the allegations set forth in the SOR under this guideline. (Government Exhibit 4.) He has a history of alcohol abuse that began in about 2001 at the age of 20, when he joined the Army. His alcohol abuse has continued over the past fourteen years, until at least 2017. He has been arrested for Driving While Intoxicated (DWI) on three occasions. In 2001, Applicant was arrested in North Carolina and charged with Driving While Intoxicated. Applicant was stopped at a DWI check point and found to be intoxicated with a blood alcohol content of .18%. (Government Exhibit 6.) The charges were eventually dropped due to the fact that Applicant was serving in the military and had moved out of the state.

The action was taken under Executive Order \n10865, Safeguarding Classified Information Within Industry (February 20, 1960), as \namended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel \nSecurity Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the \nadjudicative guidelines (AG) effective after June 8, 2017.  \n \n \nApplicant answered the SOR on May 2, 2018.  He requested that his case be \ndecided by an administrative judge on the written record without a hearing.  (Item 2.)  On \nAugust 2, 2018, Department Counsel submitted the Government\u2019s written case. A \ncomplete copy of the File of Relevant Material (FORM), containing 11 Items, was mailed \nto Applicant on August 3, 2018, and received by him on August 23, 2018.  The FORM \nnotified Applicant that he had an opportunity to file objections and submit material in \n\n \n \n2 \n \n \nrefutation, extenuation, or mitigation within 30 days of his receipt of the FORM. \nApplicant failed to respond to the FORM.  Applicant did not object to Items 1 through 11, \nand they are also admitted into evidence.  Hereinafter, they are referenced as \nGovernment Exhibits 1 through 11.   \n \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant is 36 years old.  He is employed by a defense contractor as a \nProtective Security Officer.  He is seeking to retain a security clearance in connection \nwith his employment.  Applicant began working for his current employer in September \n2015.   \n \nGuideline G \u2013 Alcohol Consumption \n \n \nThe Government alleges that the Applicant has engaged in excessive alcohol \nconsumption, which often leads to the exercise of questionable judgment or the failure \nto control impulses, and can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability and \ntrustworthiness. \n \n \nApplicant admits each of the allegations set forth in the SOR under this guideline.  \n(Government Exhibit 4.)  He has a history of alcohol abuse that began in about 2001 at \nthe age of 20, when he joined the Army.  His alcohol abuse has continued over the past \nfourteen years, until at least 2017.  He has been arrested for Driving While Intoxicated \n(DWI) on three occasions.  In 2001, Applicant was arrested in North Carolina and \ncharged with Driving While Intoxicated.  Applicant was stopped at a DWI check point \nand found to be intoxicated with a blood alcohol content of .18%.  (Government Exhibit \n6.)  The charges were eventually dropped due to the fact that Applicant was serving in \nthe military and had moved out of the state.  Applicant was arrested in January 2008 in \nWashington D.C., and was charged with Driving While Intoxicated and Speeding.  \nApplicant was pulled over while driving for going 80 mph in a 35 mph zone.  Prior to \ndriving, Applicant has been drinking at a bar.  Applicant was also found to be \nintoxicated. In July 2008, he was convicted of Driving While Intoxicated and placed on \none years of supervised probation.  In 2009, while still on probation for his 2008 offense, \nApplicant was arrested in Virginia and charged with Driving While Intoxicated 2nd \nOffense within five years.  Applicant was pulled over on his way home from a party \nbecause he was driving 90 mph.  He refused a breathalyzer and was arrested and \ncharged with Driving Under the Influence (DUI), Reckless Driving, and Refusal.  \nApplicant was convicted of DUI and Reckless Driving.  He was sentenced to 180 days \nin jail with 160 days suspended.  About this same time, he was also charged in \nMaryland with Violation of Probation from his 2008 DWI case and required to service \napproximately 20 days in jail in Maryland.  (Government Exhibits 8 and 10.)       \n \n \nSince 2009, Applicant has worked as a Security Guard.  In 2015, Applicant was \nterminated from his employment as a Security Guard for misconduct \u2013 being under the \n\n \n \n3 \n \n \ninfluence of alcohol at work.  (Government Exhibit 9.)  Applicant admits that he blacked \nout and was delusional on the day in question, although he attributes his condition to \nhigh blood sugar.  Applicant was reported to his supervisor that Applicant was drunk at \nwork.  The following day, Applicant returned to work and was asked to resign.  Applicant \nrefused to resign because he claims that the allegations against him were false.  \nInstead, he sought representation by a union representative.  (Government Exhibit 4.)  \nAt the conclusion of the investigation, Applicant was terminated. \n \nGuideline E \u2013 Personal Conduct \n \n \nThe Government alleges that the Applicant has engaged in conduct involving \nquestionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules \nand regulations which can raise questions about his reliability and trustworthiness. \n \n \nApplicant completed an Electronic Questionnaires for Investigations Processing \n(e-QIP), dated May 10, 2016.  (Government Exhibit 5.)  Section 22, regarding police \nrecords, asked him if he had ever been convicted in any court of the United States of a \ncrime, sentenced to imprisonment for a term exceeding 1 year for that crime, and \nincarcerated as a result of that sentence for not less than 1 year?  Had he ever been \ncharged with any felony offense?  Had he ever been convicted of an offense involving \ndomestic violence or a crime of violence against your child dependent, cohabitant, \nspouse, former spouse, or someone with whom he shares a child in common?  Had he \never been charged with an offense involving firearms or explosives?  Had he ever been \ncharged with an offense involving alcohol or drugs?  Applicant answered, \u201cNO\u201d.  This \nwas a false answer. Applicant failed to Iist any of his arrests set forth in the SOR \nsubparagraphs 1.b., 1.c., and 1.d., discussed above.    \n \n \nSection 13A of the same application, regarding employment activities, asked \nabout his reason for leaving prior employment.  (Government Exhibit 5.)  Applicant \nwrote that he was terminated: accused of being inattentive on post.  This was also a \nfalse answer.  Applicant failed to list that he was terminated for being under the \ninfluence of alcohol at work.  In addition, the arrests discussed above also show poor \npersonal conduct, poor judgment, and unreliability. \n \n \nApplicant states that he failed to disclose his alcohol-related arrests in his 2016 \nE-QIP because he misread the relevant question and thought he was only required to \ndisclose incidents that occurred within seven years of the date of this e-QIP submission.  \n(Government Exhibit 4.)  With regard to his employment termination, Applicant states \nthat he thought the termination letter that he signed indicated that he was being \nterminated for being in attentive on duty.  (Government Exhibit 4.)  This argument holds \nno merit.  First, Applicant does not provide any documentation in support of this claim.  \nSecond, Applicant was well aware of his alleged intoxication at work by the fact that he \nchallenged the claim against him and forced an investigation into the matter.  His \nargument is not credible.  Applicant clearly falsified information on his security clearance  \n \n\n \n \n4 \n \n \napplication in May 2016, by failing to disclose any of his alcohol-related arrests and by \nproviding a false reason for his employment termination in 2015.  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6\u00b6 2(a) and 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of applicable \nguidelines in the context of a number of variables known as the whole-person concept. \nThe administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the \nperson, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, \u201c[t]he applicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d Section 7 \nof Executive Order 10865 provides: \u201c[a]ny determination under this order adverse to an \napplicant shall be a determination in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense \nbe a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d \n \nA person applying for access to classified information seeks to enter into a \nfiduciary relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \n\n \n \n5 \n \n \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n \n \nAnalysis \n \n \nGuideline G, Alcohol Consumption \n \n \nAG \u00b6 21 expresses the security concern pertaining to alcohol consumption: \n \nExcessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable \njudgment or the failure to control impulses, and can raise questions about \nan individual's reliability and trustworthiness. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 22 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. The disqualifying conditions raised by the evidence are: \n \n(a) alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while under the \ninfluence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or other \nincidents of concern, regardless of the frequency of the individual\u2019s alcohol \nuse or whether the individual has been diagnosed with alcohol use \ndisorder; \n \n(b) alcohol-related incidents at work, such as reporting for work or duty in an \nintoxicated or impaired condition, drinking on the job, or jeopardizing the \nwelfare and safety of others, regardless of whether the individual is \ndiagnosed with alcohol use disorder; and \n \n(c) habitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point of impaired \njudgment, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed with alcohol \nuse disorder. \n  \n \nThe evidence shows that Applicant\u2019s three arrests, charges and convictions for \nDriving While intoxicated as well as his termination from employment show poor \njudgment, unreliability and untrustworthiness.  These incidents raise security concerns \nunder AG \u00b6\u00b6 22(a), 22(b), and 22(c).   \n \nAG \u00b6 23 provides conditions that could mitigate alcohol consumption security \nconcerns: \n \n(a) so much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, \nor good judgment;  \n\n \n \n6 \n \n \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her pattern  of maladaptive alcohol \nuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and \nhas demonstrated a clear  and established pattern of modified \nconsumption \nor \nabstinence \nin \naccordance \nwith \ntreatment \nrecommendations; \n \n(c) the individual is participating in counseling or a treatment program, has \nno previous history of treatment or relapse, and is making satisfactory \nprogress in a treatment program; and \n \n(d) the individual has successfully completed a treatment program along \nwith any required aftercare, and has demonstrated a clear and established \npattern of modified consumption or abstinence in accordance with treatment \nrecommendations.  \n  \n \nNone of the mitigating conditions are applicable here.  Applicant failed to \nintroduce sufficient evidence of rehabilitation.  Although his last alcohol-related arrest \noccurred in 2009, he was terminated from his employment for being intoxicated as \nrecently as 2015.  Given the extensive nature of his drinking problem, more time without \ndrinking is needed to show the Government that he will not return to his old habits.  \u00b6 32 \ndoes not provide full mitigation. \n \nGuideline E - Personal Conduct \n \nThe security concern for the personal conduct guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 15: \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to cooperate or \nprovide truthful and candid answers during national security investigative \nor adjudicative processes.   \n \n \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. The following disqualifying condition is potentially applicable: \n \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from any      \npersonnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar form   \nused to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, award \nbenefits or status, determine security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness, or \naward fiduciary responsibilities; and \n \n(c) credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is not \nsufficient for an adverse determination under any other single guideline, but \nwhich, when considered as a while, supports a whole-person assessment of \n\n \n \n7 \n \n \nquestionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations, or other characteristics \nindicating that the individual may not properly safeguard classified or sensitive \ninformation. \n \n \n \nFrom the evidence provided, Applicant deliberately failed to disclose his arrest \nhistory and real reason he was terminated from his prior employment on his security \nclearance application.  The fact that he did not list these facts in response to questions \non his on his security clearance application indicates behavior that shows questionable \njudgment, unreliability, and untrustworthiness.     \n \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s national security eligibility by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for national \nsecurity eligibility must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments \nunder Guideline G and Guideline E in my whole-person analysis.  At this time, there is \nno strong evidence in the record to show that the Applicant is now sober or will remain \nsober for any sustained period.  He has failed to present sufficient evidence of \nrehabilitation to overcome his heavy burden to mitigate his history of alcohol abuse and \npersonal conduct.  Overall, the record evidence raises doubts about Applicant\u2019s \nsuitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant failed to \nmitigate the security concerns arising from the cited adjudicative guidelines. \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n8 \n \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline G:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:   \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.b:              \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.c:   \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.d:              \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.e:              \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:                      Against Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.b:                      Against Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.c:                      Against Applicant \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant national security eligibility \nfor a security clearance.

Foreman, Esq., Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro se \n______________ \nDecision \n______________ \nCERVI, Gregg A., Administrative Judge \nThis case involves security concerns raised under Guidelines K (Handling \nProtected Information) and M (Use of Information Technology). Eligibility for access to \nclassified information is granted. \nStatement of the Case \nApplicant submitted a security clearance application (SCA) on November 23, 2015. \nOn February 12, 2018, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications Facility \n(DOD CAF) sent him a Statement of Reasons (SOR) alleging security concerns under \nGuidelines K and M.1 \nApplicant responded to the SOR on March 11, 2018, and requested a hearing \nbefore an administrative judge. The case was assigned to me on June 18, 2018. The \n1 The DOD CAF acted under Executive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \nIndustry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security \nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines \n(AG) effective on June 8, 2017. \n02/26/2019\n\n \n2 \n \nDefense Office of Hearings and Appeals issued a notice of hearing on August 1, 2018, \nand the hearing was convened on August 30, 2018. Government Exhibits (GE) 1 through \n4 were admitted into evidence without objection. Applicant testified and Applicant Exhibits \n(AE) A through D were admitted without objection. DOHA received the hearing transcript \n(Tr.) on September 10, 2018. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant is a 58-year-old system administrator, senior software engineer, and \ninformation systems security officer for a defense contractor, employed since 2008. \nApplicant married in 1980 and has two adult children. He received a bachelor\u2019s degree in \n1991. He testified that he has held a DOD top secret security clearance for nearly 30 \nyears. \n \nThe SOR alleges under Guideline K (Handling Protected Information), that \nApplicant committed security violations in 2015 by not properly securing classified \ninformation; and in 2016 by improperly using his system administrator logins and \npasswords, in violation of his privileged user agreement. The SOR also alleges that in \n2017, his employer relieved him of his information system security officer and system \nadministrator duties and access to system accounts following several inspection items \nfrom 2016 to 2017 that showed repeated failures to comply with system security \nrequirements, policies, and procedures. The incidents described in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b and 1.c \nwere cross-alleged under Guideline M (Use of Information Technology). In his Answer to \nthe SOR, Applicant admitted the two incidents in 2015 and 2016, but denied the 2017 \nallegation and the cross-allegation under Guideline M. The Government\u2019s evidence is \nsufficient to establish the SOR allegations. \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.a alleges Applicant failed to properly secure classified information. \nApplicant was appointed the information systems security officer (ISSO) by his employer \nin January 2015 after the previous ISSO retired. Applicant was not fully familiar with his \nduties and responsibilities, and relied on the security team supporting him, \u201con the job \ntraining,\u201d and the supervision of the information systems security manager (ISSM). \nHistorical audit computer logs were backed up on rewritable compact discs (CD) that were \nmarked with the appropriate security classification, since the information was being \nwritten from a classified system. The CDs were kept in plastic sleeves in a portfolio binder, \nmarked with classification markings, and secured. Applicant\u2019s assistant ISSO (AISSO) \nwas required to create the CDs for a historical record, until the company transferred all of \nthe logs to external hard drives. The CDs were phased out, and another new AISSO was \ntasked to ensure the destruction of the old CDs. Applicant and his assistant emptied all \nof the CDs from their plastic sleeves in the binder, and sent the \u201cempty\u201d portfolio binder \nto a supply room to be reused. The supply room was in an access-controlled area, but \nnot a classified controlled area. The binder was later discovered by an employee with one \nCD still in a sleeve. Applicant claims the CD did not have any classified information on it, \nbut it was marked \u201cclassified\u201d because the data came from a classified computer system. \nApplicant was cited for a security violation, but there was no evidence of loss, compromise \n\n \n3 \n \nor suspected compromise of classified information found. Applicant took responsibility for \nthe mistake, was given remedial training, and never repeated this security violation again. \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.b alleges Applicant improperly used his system administrator logins and \npasswords, and failed to follow user privileges and information assurance procedures. \nShortly after assuming the ISSO position, Applicant was tasked to work on an information \nsystem (IS) with which he was previously unfamiliar. He was read into the program, and \nentered the particular lab in 2015, where he first saw a completely assembled IS system. \nHe noted that the IS had not been certified, however it was already located in a special \nsecured area. Applicant was tasked to certify it by the security official for the program. At \nthe time, common practice was to allow the ISSO to log into the system using root \ncredentials, but that practice was later stopped. Applicant met with the security staff for \nthe program and explained what he needed to do to certify the IS, and Applicant \nrequested that the security department permit another system administrator (SA) who \ndeveloped the IS, to assist him. The SA was briefed by the program security officer and \npermitted to enter the space. Applicant later learned that the security official was not \nauthorized to give the SA both a general user and a privileged user briefing at once. One \nof the briefings should have been done by another security office within the company, but \nApplicant noted it was often done by the same person. According to Applicant, once the \noversight was discovered, the SA received the proper authorization \u201cwithin five minutes,\u201d \nand believed his actions were authorized and the most efficient method to accomplish the \ntask.  \n \nApplicant was also alleged to have continued to use the root account for logins \nafter the system had been certified, and that he failed to document the logins using the \nroot account for tracking and auditing purposes. Applicant explained that using the root \ncredentials was the only way to solve the problems with the IS, and that the security \ndepartment should have made logs available to be used to document occasions where \nthe root certification was used. However, Applicant took responsibility for not logging the \nuses properly, and testified that logins were in fact traceable, even without the logs. As a \nresult of the security violation, Applicant was denied access to particular programs \noperated by that military branch. No evidence of loss, compromise, or suspected \ncompromise of classified information was found. \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.c alleges that Applicant was relieved of his ISSO duties and access to \nsecure areas in October 2017, after self-inspections disclosed repeated failures to comply \nwith the information system configuration and operational security requirements, policies, \nand procedures. In particular, the Government\u2019s evidence shows various non-compliance \nissues with users on the system, user briefings, seal logs, incomplete permissions and \nauditing settings, poor maintenance log retention, laptop CD/DVD drive and removable \nmedia controls not configured properly, and no system warning banner displayed. In \naddition, Applicant did not correct the deficiencies within the two-week period provided. \n \nApplicant explained that he was responsible for keeping track of 200 user \nauthorizations for 18 systems. There were discussions and changes to the user \nauthorization procedures and forms during this period, and that the system in question \n\n \n4 \n \nwas housed at a military base under a mobile deployment plan to allow it to be operated \nin the field. At the same time the system was returned to Applicant\u2019s facility for audits, \npatching, and updates after a longer-than-usual period outside the facility, a self-\ninspection was conducted. Applicant supported the self-inspection and was interested in \nseeing the results so that he could make the corrections and return the system back to \nthe field. Applicant argued that the ISSM agreed with the field engineers to permit them \nto create user accounts and were responsible for the system while it was outside \nApplicant\u2019s facility. Applicant did not have physical access to the system or oversight while \nit was in the field, and the engineers improperly created new user accounts for personnel \nthat needed access while the system was deployed.  \n \nApplicant sent his ASSOs to the meeting to discuss the self-inspection findings \nbecause of a conflict, and later learned that his ASSOs did not make the simple \ncorrections to fix the deficiencies. Applicant\u2019s access was denied before he could inspect \nthe system on his own, and was not fully apprised of the deficiencies after the self-\ninspection. After being denied access, Applicant spent the next two weeks instructing his \nASSOs on how to correct the deficiencies. Applicant admits he should have been more \nforceful in demanding the list of findings of the self-inspection and more proactive in \naddressing the problems, but relied on others to do the work. Applicant agrees that he \nwas responsible for supervising his ASSOs in completing the work required, but notes \nthat security rules changed after the system was certified for deployment. He disagreed \nwith some of the findings regarding hard drives, and asserted that the ISSM shared \nresponsibility for the system, certified it for mobile deployment, and should have worked \nwith him to correct deficiencies once they were discovered, rather than deny him access. \nHe also acknowledged that he was aware of one previous user agreement deficiency \nbefore the 2017 findings, but not the other previous deficiencies noted in the self-\ninspection report. No compromise of classified information or counter-intelligence \nimplications were found as a result of the incidents discussed above. \n \nApplicant emphatically denies any intention to violate security rules or procedures \nduring any of the incidents listed in the SOR. He had never had a security violation in the \npast, despite nearly 30 years with a top secret security clearance. He believes the large \nvolume of work and poor training and directions from his manager led to the eventual \nsecurity violations. Applicant submitted a detailed narrative response to the allegations, \na 2016 security training certification, a certificate of recognition from his company, and \nother documents in support of his testimony. His testimony was comprehensive, \nstraightforward, and sincere, while always maintaining his professionalism. \n \nApplicant\u2019s former information systems security risk manager and former ISSM at \nthe company provided a signed, sworn statement of support for Applicant, and claimed \nthat three unnamed employees within the information security office targeted Applicant \nand other employees to interpret the rules to find security infractions in order to cause \nthem to lose their security clearance and job. He noted that once an infraction was found, \nthe employee had very little recourse in defense. He also noted that Applicant was \ntrustworthy, and called him an asset to the community that cares about protecting \nclassified information and a proud supporter of the warfighter. No corroborating evidence \n\n \n5 \n \nof inappropriate behavior of security personnel at the company was presented at the \nhearing, but Applicant quoted the writer\u2019s claim in his Answer to the SOR. \n \nAnother coworker attested to Applicant\u2019s good judgment, stating he would never \nknowingly violate security regulations or procedures, and noted Applicant was \nconscientious, stable, caring, and trustworthy. A director of security for another defense \ncontractor who has known Applicant since 1987 when they were friends and coworkers, \nwrote of Applicant\u2019s \u201cgreat integrity.\u201d A current engineer at Applicant\u2019s company wrote of \nApplicant\u2019s reliability, good judgment, stability, and responsibility. He notes situations \nwhere Applicant steadfastly followed security rules to maintain security compliance \nregardless of user complaints or inconvenience. \n \nPolicies \n \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 2. \n \nNational security eligibility is predicated upon the applicant meeting the criteria \ncontained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. \nInstead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge applies \nthese guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative \njudge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider a person\u2019s stability, trustworthiness, reliability, \ndiscretion, character, honesty, and judgment. AG \u00b6 1(b). \n \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865  \n\u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \n \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \n\n \n6 \n \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \u201cSubstantial \nevidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. Washington \nMetro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines presume a \nnexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria listed \ntherein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 12-01295 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Jan. 20, 2015). \n \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, \nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. \n02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \n \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01- \n20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see, AG \u00b6 1(d). \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline K: Handling Protected Information \nAG \u00b6 33 expresses the handling protected information security concern: \nDeliberate or negligent failure to comply with rules and regulations for \nhandling protected information-which includes classified and other sensitive \ngovernment information, and proprietary information-raises doubt about an \nindividual\u2019s trustworthiness, judgment, reliability, or willingness and ability \nto safeguard such information, and is a serious security concern. \n \nRelevant conditions that could raise a security concern under AG \u00b6 34 and may be \ndisqualifying include: \n \n(b) collecting or storing protected information in any unauthorized location; \n \n(c) loading, drafting, editing, storing, transmitting, or otherwise handling \nprotected information, including images, on any unauthorized equipment or \nmedium; \n \n(g) any failure to comply with rules for the protection of classified or sensitive \ninformation; and \n \n(h) negligence or lax security practices that persist despite counseling by \nmanagement. \n \n\n \n7 \n \nThe evidence presented is sufficient to raise the security concerns described \nabove. \n \nGuideline K includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising from \nincidents regarding handling protected information. Relevant conditions that could \nmitigate security concerns under AG \u00b6 35 include: \n \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the behavior, or it has happened so \ninfrequently or under such unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur \nand does not cast doubt on the individual's current reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(b) the individual responded favorably to counseling or remedial security \ntraining and now demonstrates a positive attitude toward the discharge of \nsecurity responsibilities; \n \n(c) the security violations were due to improper or inadequate training or \nunclear instructions; and \n \n(d) the violation was inadvertent, it was promptly reported, there is no \nevidence of compromise, and it does not suggest a pattern. \n \n \nThe security violations from 2015 to 2017 described in the SOR were adequately \naddressed and in some cases, plausibly contested by Applicant. He has held a security \nclearance for nearly 30 years without incident before these incidents occurred. There is \nsome evidence that he was appointed ISSO without sufficient training or direction. He \nacknowledged the 2015 and 2016 incidents, and took responsibility for not adequately \nsupervising his assistants in response to the 2017 self-inspection report. He noted that \nhe should have been more proactive and aggressive in ensuring he understood the \ndeficiencies and addressed them in a timely manner. However, Applicant generally \ndenies responsibility for the 2017 deficiencies found on a system that was outside his \ncontrol for an extended period of time, and operated under an agreement between his \nmanager and the company engineers. \n \nRegardless of the actual security violations imputed to Applicant by reason of his \ndirect action or supervisory responsibilities, the evidence does not suggest a pattern of \nrules violations outside of isolated incidents. There was no compromise of classified \ninformation, and the counter-intelligence review did not reveal a concern. There is \nadequate evidence to suggest that Applicant attempted to perform his duties as assigned, \nbut the direction and training were insufficient to prevent the security incidents from \noccurring. Disputes over subject matter knowledge or work performance do not \nnecessarily implicate security concerns. Applicant did not hide any incidents, and \naccepted responsibility for his role and willingly participated in retraining when offered. \nBased on his limited experience as an ISSO, he is now more attuned to the potential \npitfalls while performing similar tasks. Applicant is strongly supported by his former ISSM \n\n \n8 \n \nand co-workers who attest to his trustworthiness and security consciences. AG \u00b6\u00b6 35(a), \n(b), (c), and (d) apply. \n \nGuideline M: Use of Information Technology Systems \n \n \nAG \u00b6 39 expresses the security concern pertaining to use of information \ntechnology systems: \n \nFailure to comply with rules, procedures, guidelines, or regulations \npertaining to information technology systems may raise security concerns \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, calling into question the \nwillingness or ability to properly protect sensitive systems, networks, and \ninformation. \n \nRelevant conditions that could raise a security concern under AG \u00b6 40 and may be \ndisqualifying include: \n \n(g) negligence or lax security practices in handling information technology \nthat persists despite counseling by management. \n \nThe evidence presented is minimally sufficient to raise the security concern \ndescribed above, and a similar security concern is included under AG \u00b6 34 (Guideline K). \nThe findings of fact, discussion, reasoning, and mitigation applicable under Guideline K, \napply equally to the concern raised under Guideline M, and are incorporated herein. \nTherefore, no additional discussion of Guideline M concerns is required. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6\u00b6 2(a), 2(c), and 2(d), the ultimate determination of whether to grant \nnational security eligibility must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. Under the whole-person \nconcept, the administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security \nclearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process \nfactors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d). \n \nI considered all of the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my findings of fact \nand comments under Guidelines K and M, in my whole-person analysis. I also considered \nApplicant\u2019s long history of employment and security eligibility. I am convinced that the \nsecurity incidents identified in the SOR were unintentional, isolated incidents. No \ncompromise of classified information was found. Based on the testimony and \ndocumentary evidence, I am convinced that these incident are behind him and similar \nviolations are unlikely to recur. I have no doubts about Applicant\u2019s judgment, honesty, \nand trustworthiness. \n \n\n \n9 \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline K:  \n \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n  Subparagraphs 1.a - 1.c:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n   \nParagraph 2, Guideline M:  \n \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n  Subparagraph 2.a:  \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \nI conclude that it is clearly consistent with the national security interests of the \nUnited States to continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nApplicant\u2019s security clearance is granted. \n \n \n \n   _______________________ \nGregg A.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact The SOR alleges under Guideline F that, as of January 16, 2018, Applicant was past due $14,588 on a mortgage in foreclosure status with a $109,401 balance (SOR \u00b6 1.a), and that he owed charged-off credit card balances of $11,984 (SOR \u00b6 1.b) and $8,070 (SOR \u00b6 1.c). When he responded to the SOR in March 2018, Applicant admitted the debts, which he attributed to loss of a job and an economic downturn in the information technology sector in his previous locale, which made it difficult for him to find a job at an income needed to cover all his financial obligations. He indicated that the mortgage delinquency was settled without a final judgment of foreclosure. Applicant explained that he had no success in negotiating a settlement of the credit card debts. After considering the pleadings, exhibits, and transcript, I make the following findings of fact. Applicant is a 46-year-old information technology network engineer. He has a bachelor\u2019s degree in computer science awarded in June 1996, and a master\u2019s degree in business administration awarded in December 2000.

Temple, Esq., Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro se \n______________ \nDecision \n______________ \nMATCHINSKI, Elizabeth M., Administrative Judge: \nApplicant defaulted on a mortgage loan and on two credit-card accounts. The \nmortgage was released after he abandoned the property. He made no payments on \n$20,054 in charged-off credit-card delinquencies because they are no longer legally \ncollectible. Concerns about his financial judgment persist. Clearance is denied. \nStatement of the Case \nOn January 16, 2018, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications \nFacility (DOD CAF) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant, detailing security \nconcerns under Guideline F, financial considerations. The SOR explained why the DOD \nCAF was unable to find it clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue \nsecurity clearance eligibility for him. The DOD CAF took the action under Executive Order \n(EO) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as \namended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review \nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the National Security Adjudicative \nGuidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information or Eligibility to \nHold a Sensitive Position (AG) effective within the DOD on June 8, 2017. \n12/17/2018\n\n2 \n \nApplicant responded to the SOR on March 1, 2018, and requested a hearing before \nan administrative judge from the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA). On July \n18, 2018, the case was assigned to me to conduct a hearing to determine whether it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for \nApplicant. On August 6, 2018, I scheduled a hearing for September 18, 2018. \n \nAt the hearing, five Government exhibits (GEs 1-5) were admitted. A March 28, \n2018 letter forwarding the proposed GEs to Applicant was marked as a hearing exhibit (HE \n1) for the record but not admitted in evidence. Six Applicant exhibits (AEs A-F) were \nadmitted in evidence. Applicant testified, as reflected in a transcript (Tr.) received on \nSeptember 27, 2018. \n \nI held the record open, initially for six weeks, for post-hearing documentation from \nApplicant. On October 29, 2018, Applicant submitted a letter from an attorney (AE G), and \nrequested a three-week extension to submit more evidence. On November 5, 2018, \nDepartment Counsel expressed no objection to AE G, but opposed an additional extension \non the basis that Applicant had made little attempt in the time allotted to contact his \ncreditors. I admitted AE G into the record and extended the deadline to November 26, \n2018. On November 8, 2017, Applicant submitted comments by email, which I accepted \ninto the record as AE H without any response from the Government. On November 26, \n2018, Applicant submitted an email with a billing statement from his attorney, which was \nmarked as AE I and entered into evidence, the Government having no objections. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nThe SOR alleges under Guideline F that, as of January 16, 2018, Applicant was \npast due $14,588 on a mortgage in foreclosure status with a $109,401 balance (SOR \u00b6 \n1.a), and that he owed charged-off credit card balances of $11,984 (SOR \u00b6 1.b) and \n$8,070 (SOR \u00b6 1.c). When he responded to the SOR in March 2018, Applicant admitted \nthe debts, which he attributed to loss of a job and an economic downturn in the information \ntechnology sector in his previous locale, which made it difficult for him to find a job at an \nincome needed to cover all his financial obligations. He indicated that the mortgage \ndelinquency was settled without a final judgment of foreclosure. Applicant explained that he \nhad no success in negotiating a settlement of the credit card debts. After considering the \npleadings, exhibits, and transcript, I make the following findings of fact. \n \nApplicant is a 46-year-old information technology network engineer. He has a \nbachelor\u2019s degree in computer science awarded in June 1996, and a master\u2019s degree in \nbusiness administration awarded in December 2000. He began working for his current \nemployer, a defense contractor, in September 2016. (GEs 1-2.) \n \nApplicant and his ex-wife married in March 1998 and purchased a home. They had \na daughter in 2001. In April 2004, they moved to a new locale. They bought a home, \nobtaining a mortgage loan for $60,000. They began having marital difficulties, and decided \nto separate in 2006. (GE 1; Tr. 40-41.) They sold their marital home for approximately what \nthey owed on the mortgage. They also sold a parcel of land to settle some debts. In August \n\n3 \n \n2006, Applicant\u2019s ex-wife purchased a home for herself and their daughter. She paid for \nthe home in part with an $88,400 mortgage loan on which Applicant was also liable. The \nmortgage payments were $768 a month. Applicant resided with his ex-wife and his \ndaughter until February 2007, when he purchased a residence for himself with a mortgage \nloan of $101,200, on which his ex-wife was also liable (SOR \u00b6 1.a). His mortgage loan \npayments were approximately $916 monthly. They jointly obtained a $25,300 home-equity \nloan, to be repaid at $103 monthly. Applicant was employed as an information technology \nmanager at the time. (Answer; GEs 1-5; AE F; Tr. 40-42, 45-46.) \n \nApplicant and his ex-wife were able to maintain the mortgage payments on their \nrespective residences for a few years. In March 2009, Applicant left his job of six years \nafter his employer hired someone else to maintain a program that Applicant had \nupgraded.1  Applicant started his own computer business, but his self-employment income \nwas not sufficient to cover all of his bills. He relied on credit cards, retirement savings, and \nfinancial assistance from his father, to pay his living expenses, mortgage, and car payment. \nHe obtained a car loan of $13,982 in July 2007 that he repaid at $277 a month until it was \nfully satisfied in January 2012. (Answer; GEs 1-2; Tr. 42, 47.) \n \nIn July 2012, Applicant and his ex-wife became delinquent on the mortgage loan \n(SOR \u00b6 1.a) and on the home-equity loan for his then residence. Applicant consulted with a \nrealtor in late September 2012 for help with the paperwork \u201cto get out from under the \nhouse.\u201d Applicant moved out of the house in November 2012 (Tr. 47-48) and prepared \npaperwork to deed the property in lieu of foreclosure, which the lender rejected in April \n2013. (AE E.) The lender wanted to do a short sale, but rejected an offer of $50,000 for the \nproperty. (Tr. 43.) When the mortgage account became past due for $14,588, the lender \ninitiated foreclosure proceedings. (GEs 1-5.) \n \nIn February 2013, Applicant obtained part-time employment with a home-\nimprovement retailer. (GE 1; Tr. 43.) His credit-card account in SOR \u00b6 1.b was closed in \nMarch 2013 for nonpayment since December 19, 2012. A credit line obtained in February \n2008 (SOR \u00b6 1.c) was likewise closed in March 2013 for nonpayment after December 19, \n2012. As of August 2016, the balances of the charged-off accounts were $11,984 (SOR \u00b6 \n1.b) and $8,070 (SOR \u00b6 1.c). Another credit-card account, which had a credit limit of \n$7,200 but a high credit of $12,369, was placed for collection after no payments were \nmade after February 2013. Applicant settled the debt for less than its full balance by \nJanuary 2014. (GE 3.) \n \n \nWith his divorce not yet finalized, Applicant relocated to his present area in August \n2013 for a full-time position with the home-improvement retailer. He took on a second job \nwith another retailer for a short time, and was able to pay his bills but not get ahead. (GE 1; \nAE E; Tr. 43-44.) On October 10, 2013, the lender released the mortgage on his previous \nresidence, and on October 31, 2013, issued a 1099-A Form, Acquisition of Abandonment \n                                                 \n1 Applicant indicated on his August 2016 security clearance application that he left his job for \u201chealth reasons.\u201d \n(GE 1.) When he responded to the SOR, he indicated that he lost his job after the employer hired someone at \na much lower salary to maintain the system Applicant upgraded. (Answer.) He provided no documentation \nshowing that he was laid off.  \n\n4 \n \nof Secured Property.2 At the time, Applicant and his ex-wife owed a principal balance of \n$91,282 on their mortgage loan, and the property was valued at $105,570. (AE F; 42-44, \n48.) Applicant\u2019s understanding was that he and his ex-wife no longer had any obligation on \nthe loan or on the home-equity loan. (Tr. 49.) \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s gross income for tax purposes was $31,005 in 2014, $30,696 in 2015, \nand $21,609 in 2016. (AE B.) He collected worker\u2019s compensation in 2016 after injuring his \nknee on the job, which was not taxable. (Tr. 44-45.) \n \n \nOn August 2, 2016, Applicant completed and certified to the accuracy of a \nQuestionnaire for National Security Positions (SF 86) to work for his current employer. In \nresponse to the delinquency involving routine accounts, Applicant listed the delinquent \nmortgage, which he indicated was resolved in October 2013 through return of the property. \nHe also listed the defaulted home-equity line of credit as resolved in October 2013. \nApplicant listed the charged-off credit card for $11,984 (SOR \u00b6 1.b), and indicated that he \nhad not taken any actions to resolve it because of a lack of income. He disclosed the \ndefaulted credit account for $8,070 (SOR \u00b6 1.c), but stated in part: \u201cChecking\u2014I received a \n\u2018gains\u2019 tax form for a write off but still shows on credit report\u2014will need to call and correct \nthem showing that I owe money.\u201d (GE 1.) In September 2016, Applicant began working for \nhis current employer at an annual salary of $80,000. (Tr. 57.) \n \n \nOn September 28, 2017, Applicant was interviewed by an authorized investigator for \nthe Office of Personnel Management (OPM). Applicant explained that he signed over the \ndeed in lieu of foreclosure to resolve the defaulted mortgage (SOR \u00b6 1.a) and related \nhome-equity loans on the property. He indicated that he could not maintain the loan \npayments because of low-paying jobs and insufficient income while self-employed. He \nasserted that he was still in negotiations with his creditors to settle his $11,984 and $8,020 \ncredit-card delinquencies. He had settled a $12,369 credit-card collection debt for $2,000. \nApplicant volunteered that he began working part time for the home-improvement retailer in \nearly September 2017 in addition to maintaining his full-time job with a defense contractor.3 \n(GE 2.) \n                                                 \n2 As the borrower, Applicant was instructed on the 1099-A that if he abandoned the property, he may have \nincome from the discharge of indebtedness in the amount of the unpaid balance of his cancelled debt. (AE F.) \nThe market value of the property as of October 2013 exceeded the principal loan balance by $14,288.34, but \nApplicant and his ex-wife were $14,588 past-due on the loan at the time it was released. There is no evidence \nthat the lender has pursued Applicant for any deficiency, even though the debt was still on his credit record as \nof March 2018. (GE 5.) For tax purposes, abandonment is treated differently from foreclosure. Generally, \nabandonment is not treated as a sale or exchange of the property while a foreclosure is treated as a sale or \nexchange. If the amount realized from an abandonment is more than an individual\u2019s adjusted basis, it amounts \nto a gain, if less, then it is a loss. See IRS Publication 544.  If property is abandoned that secures a debt for \nwhich one is personally liable (recourse debt) and the debt is cancelled, the individual realizes ordinary income \nequal to the canceled debt. That income must be reported on an individual\u2019s tax return unless one of the \nexceptions or exclusions applies. See IRS Publication 4681. There is no evidence that the mortgage holder \nissued a 1099-C cancelling the debt. As to whether Applicant reported release of responsibility for the debt as \nincome on his tax returns for 2013, Applicant testified that an accountant handled his and his then wife\u2019s \nincome tax returns, which were filed separately. He indicated that he did not receive a copy of his return and \ncould provide no information in that regard. (Tr. 62-63.) \n  \n3Applicant testified at his September 2018 hearing that he has held the part-time job for four or five months. \n\n5 \n \n  \nIn November 2017, Equifax reported the delinquent mortgage (SOR \u00b6 1.a) as \n$14,588 past due as of November 2014. The defaulted credit cards (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b and 1.c) \nwere reported as unpaid charge-offs. (GE 4.) In January 2018, the DOD CAF issued an \nSOR to Applicant because of the mortgage and two credit-card delinquencies. In response \nto the SOR, Applicant indicated that the mortgage was settled without a foreclosure, but \nthat he had been unable \u201cto get any recourse\u201d regarding the credit-card debts. (Answer.) \nAs of March 2018, the mortgage was on his credit record as a \u201cforeclosure\u201d and past due \nfor $14,588. No payments had been made toward the $11,984 and $8,070 charged-off \ncredit delinquencies. Applicant was making payments on terms acceptable to his creditor \non a credit card with a $1,000 limit opened in January 2017. (GE 5.) The card is self-\nfunded in that Applicant deposits $1,000 and can charge against his balance. (Tr. 58.) \n \n \nApplicant purchased a legal plan through his part-time job with the home-\nimprovement retailer, and in approximately July 2018, he consulted with an attorney, \nprimarily about routine legal services. (Tr. 54.) Applicant advised the attorney that he had \ntwo old credit-card accounts that he last used six years ago and were closed in 2013. The \nattorney advised him to look into the applicable state statute of limitations regarding debt \ncollection. According to Applicant, the attorney stated that if it was close to the date barring \nlegal collection, he would suggest \u201cjust let it ride.\u201d (Tr. 29-30.) Applicant already knew that \nthe state in which he incurred his credit debts has a three-year statute of limitations for \ncredit-card debts. (Tr. 56.) He learned that the state has a five-year statute of limitations on \nwritten contracts, and that the state in which he has resided since August 2013 was more \nfavorable to creditors in that it has a six-year statute of limitations for all financial contracts. \n(AEs D, G; Tr. 56.) Applicant considered the credit-card delinquencies \u201coff the books and \noff [his] plate.\u201d Thinking he had a slim chance of obtaining the security clearance needed to \nkeep his job, he made no effort to resolve his delinquent debts as of September 2018. (AE \nD; Tr. 49-50, 56.) \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s current annual income from his defense-contractor job is approximately \n$80,105. (Tr. 44-45, 51, 57.) He had $3,635 in combined checking account deposits as of \nSeptember 2018, but his rent check had not yet cleared. (Tr. 26.) He had $13,272 in his \nsavings accounts. (AE C.) Applicant has been building his savings for emergency \nexpenses because of his difficulty getting consumer credit. (Tr. 51-52.) He averaged \n$2,195 in monthly bill expenses from April 2018 to September 2018, which included rent at \n$1,435 per month but excluded food, personal care items, and other miscellaneous \nexpenses. (AE B.) Applicant pays $100 in child support per month and has his daughter on \nhis health insurance. (Tr. 52.) Applicant recently purchased a motorcycle for $700 cash that \nhe uses on occasion to keep down the mileage on his 2007 model-year vehicle, which has \n160,000 miles on the engine. (Tr. 53.) \n \n \nAt his hearing, Applicant admitted that he did not want to reach out to his creditors to \nresolve the credit-card delinquencies because it would \u201crestart the time clock\u201d on the debts \nif he was going to be denied security clearance eligibility because of the defaulted \nmortgage. (Tr. 30.) He expressed a willingness to contact his creditors and attempt good-\n                                                                                                                                                             \n(Tr. 57.) He discrepantly gave a start date of September 9, 2017, for his part-time employment during his \nsubject interview in late September 2017. (GE 2.) The discrepancy was not clarified. \n\n6 \n \nfaith settlements. I held the record open for over two months for Applicant to present \nevidence of settlement efforts. Applicant presented a letter from his attorney who rendered \nhis professional opinion that Applicant\u2019s debts are no longer legally collectible because the \nlaws of the state where the debts were incurred are likely controlling, and it has been more \nthan three years since Applicant\u2019s last payment on the credit accounts. Regarding the \ndefaulted mortgage, the attorney indicated that the five-year statute of limitations for written \ncontracts has expired because Applicant defaulted on the loan before the October 31, \n2013 date of abandonment of the property. (AE G.) The attorney billed Applicant $1,091 for \nhis services providing advice and his legal opinion on the debt matters. (AE I.) \n \n \nOn November 8, 2018, Applicant explained that he would have resolved his past-\ndue credit-card debts two years ago if he had not been told by a co-worker that he would \nbe disqualified from having a security clearance granted if he had a bankruptcy or a \nforeclosure on his record. Applicant requested that he be granted three months to address \nhis credit issues, and that, if he fails to do so, Department Counsel could appeal a \nfavorable grant. (AE H.) I held the record open to November 26, 2018, for proof of any \nefforts to resolve the SOR debts. On November 26, 2018, Applicant responded that he \nused the time to contact his creditors, but he had not been able to resolve the issues. He \nadmitted that he is \u201cconflicted\u201d about resolving the debts because they are so close to \ndropping from his credit record, but that to get a clearance and work the issue in a short \ntime as a requirement for continued employment would be the only option to \u201caccept the \npunishment of having 7 more years of bad debt.\u201d (AE I.)  \n  \n \nApplicant provides engineering support for a U.S. military program on a military \nbase. The program manager has been able to rely on him \u201cto be polite, inquisitive, \nprofessional and a team player in any area of [their] work.\u201d Applicant has been \u201cpunctual, \ndedicated and passionate about his work.\u201d (AE A.) \n \n \nApplicant also provided character reference letters from personal associates and \nfriends. Applicant has been active in his church. He has demonstrated honesty and \nreliability in his dealings with his pastor. A longtime friend also attested to Applicant\u2019s \ntrustworthiness. A former co-worker and small business partner indicated that Applicant \nhas always upheld the strictest of moral standards. Applicant was described as \u201cefficient, \ndetail-oriented, and extremely competent\u201d by a former colleague. They met in 1999 while \nperforming contract work for a defense contractor. Applicant has been \u201ca go-to resource\u201d \nfor him on more than one occasion when he needed help on projects. He has known \nApplicant to \u201clead by example when it came to ensuring the safety and security of \ninformation and people both professionally and personally.\u201d (AE A.) \n \nPolicies \n \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion the Executive \nBranch has in regulating access to information pertaining to national security,  emphasizing \nthat \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 \nU.S. 518, 528 (1988). When evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, \nthe administrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \n\n7 \n \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are required to be considered in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. These guidelines \nare not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, \nthese guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative \nprocess. The administrative judge\u2019s overall adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious \nscrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative \njudge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, \nfavorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence \nto establish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant \nis responsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation about potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Section 7 of EO 10865 \nprovides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a \ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section \n3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information). \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \n \n \nThe security concerns about financial considerations are articulated in AG \u00b6 18: \n \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness \nto abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about an \nindividual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified or \nsensitive information. Financial distress can also be caused or exacerbated \nby, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other issues of personnel security \nconcern such as excessive gambling, mental health conditions, substance \n\n8 \n \nmisuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An individual who is financially \noverextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or otherwise \nquestionable acts to generate funds. . . . \n \n \nThe Appeal Board explained the scope and rationale for the financial considerations \nsecurity concern in ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012) (citation omitted) \nas follows: \n \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an applicant might knowingly \ncompromise classified information in order to raise money in satisfaction of \nhis or her debts. Rather, it requires a Judge to examine the totality of an \napplicant\u2019s financial history and circumstances. The Judge must consider \npertinent evidence regarding the applicant\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other \nqualities essential to protecting the national secrets as well as the \nvulnerabilities inherent in the circumstances. The Directive presumes a \nnexus between proven conduct under any of the Guidelines and an \napplicant\u2019s security eligibility. \n \nApplicant\u2019s admissions and the available credit reports establish the delinquencies \nalleged in the SOR. In 2012, Applicant and his ex-wife defaulted on a mortgage loan for his \nthen residence. Applicant made no payments on the credit cards in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b and 1.c \nafter December 2012, and his accounts were closed in March 2013 because of \nnonpayment. Disqualifying conditions AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a), \u201cinability to satisfy debts,\u201d and 19(c), \u201ca \nhistory of not meeting financial obligations,\u201d apply. Moreover, AG \u00b6 19(b), \u201cunwillingness to \nsatisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so,\u201d is implicated. Applicant chose to ignore the \ncredit-card delinquencies even after obtaining his present job at a salary of $80,000 a year \nbecause collection was legally barred in the state in which he incurred the debts. \n \nApplicant has the burden of establishing that matters in mitigation apply. One or \nmore of the following conditions under AG \u00b6 20 may apply: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under \nsuch circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the \nindividual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem from a \nlegitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit counseling service, \nand there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under \ncontrol; \n \n\n9 \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue. \n \nAlthough the delinquencies were incurred more than five years ago, AG \u00b6 20(a) is \nnot mitigating of his years of disregard of his legitimate indebtedness. He has made no \npayments toward the debts, even though they continue to adversely affect his credit. \n \nAG \u00b6 20(b) has some applicability in that the debts were caused by \nunderemployment. Whether he resigned voluntarily from his job in March 2009 for health \nreasons, was laid off, or forced out when his employer hired someone else to manage the \nsystem he had upgraded, Applicant was unable to find work in the information technology \nsector for the income needed to meet all his financial obligations. As a self-employed \ncomputer engineer, he had no control over the market for his services. Even though his \ndebts may be attributed to conditions beyond his control, Applicant must also demonstrate \nthat he acted responsibly under the circumstances to address his delinquent debts. \nRegarding the delinquent mortgage, he offered to deed the property in lieu of foreclosure \nand tried a short sale before the lender deemed the property abandoned and released the \nmortgage. Applicant and his spouse were $14,588 past due on their loan at the time. He \nwas released from the mortgage in October 2013, although there is no indication that his \ndebt was cancelled. Even giving him some time to stabilize his finances after he began his \ndefense-contractor employment in September 2016, he did not demonstrate an adherence \nto his financial obligations by ignoring known credit card delinquencies because they were \nno longer legally collectible in the state where the debts were incurred. \n \nNeither AG \u00b6 20(c) nor AG \u00b6 20(d) has been shown to fully apply. There is no \nevidence that Applicant is being pursued for any debt on the mortgage loan. However, \nabandonment of a financial obligation is not a good-faith effort to resolve a debt. Regarding \nthe statute of limitations, the Appeal Board recently reaffirmed its long-held position about \ndebts that are no longer legally collectible, as follows: \n \nThe security significance of long delinquent debts is not diminished merely \nbecause the debts have become legally unenforceable owing to the passage \nof time. Security clearance decisions are not controlled or limited by any \nstatute of limitation, and reliance on the non-collectability of a debt does not \nconstitute a good-faith effort to resolve that debt within the meaning of the \nDirective. A security clearance adjudication is not a proceeding aimed at \ncollecting an applicant\u2019s personal debts. Rather a security clearance \nadjudication is a proceeding aimed at evaluating an applicant\u2019s judgment, \nreliability, and trustworthiness to make a decision about the applicant\u2019s \nsecurity eligibility. Accordingly, even if a delinquent debt is legally \nunenforceable . . . , the federal government is entitled to consider the facts \n\n10 \n \nand circumstances surrounding an applicant\u2019s conduct in incurring and failing \nto satisfy the debt in a timely manner. \n \nISCR Case No. 17-01473 at 5 (App. Bd. Aug. 10, 2018) (quoting ISCR Case No. 10-03656 \nat 3 (App. Bd. Jan. 19, 2011)). \n \nApplicant was on notice as of his September 2017 interview that his delinquent \ndebts were of concern to the DOD. He indicated at that time that he was still under \nnegotiations to settle his delinquent credit-card accounts. He now admits that he did not \nintend to resolve them because the statute of limitations had run. Even before he consulted \nwith an attorney in July 2018, he did not see a reason to address his delinquent debts, \nthinking that he had a slim chance of obtaining a security clearance. While it may be \nfinancially advantageous for Applicant to wait for the debts to drop from his credit report, it \ncasts doubt on his judgment and reliability with regard to complying with security rules and \nregulations. \n \nApplicant\u2019s financial situation has stabilized in that he is able to meet all of his \ncurrent financial obligations. He has managed to accumulate approximately $13,272 in \nsavings, which would indicate that he has some funds available to make payments toward \nhis delinquent debts. After his hearing, Applicant requested that he be granted a security \nclearance conditionally for two to three months to give him time to address his debts, and if \nhe fails to do so, the Government can then appeal the favorable grant. I have considered \nthe exceptions in Appendix C of the Directive4 and decline to apply them, particularly in this \ncase where Applicant was given more than two months after his hearing to show that he is \ncurrently engaged in any debt-resolution efforts or repayment plans. While he may now be \nwilling to accept \u201cthe punishment of having 7 more years of bad debt,\u201d it is not enough to \nwarrant an exception. The Appeal Board has consistently held that a promise to pay a debt \nin the future is not a substitute for a track record of paying debts in a timely manner. See \ne.g., ISCR Case No. 09-05390 at 2 (App. Bd. Oct. 22, 2010). Applicant has not mitigated \nthe financial considerations security concerns. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \nIn assessing the whole person, the administrative judge must consider the totality of \nan applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant circumstances in light of the nine adjudicative \nprocess factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). The analysis under Guideline F is incorporated in my whole-\nperson analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were addressed under that guideline, but \nsome warrant additional comment. \n \n \nApplicant has been a productive and dedicated employee for a defense contractor. \nHis government customer has been able to rely on him for engineering support. Yet, it is \nwell settled that once a concern arises regarding an applicant\u2019s security clearance \neligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or renewal of a security \n                                                 \n4 Appendix C of Security Executive Agent Directive (SEAD) 4 grants DOHA administrative judges the \ndiscretionary authority to grant initial or continued eligibility for a security clearance despite the presence of an \nissue(s) that can be partially but not completely mitigated with the provision of additional security measures. \n\n11 \n \nclearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th Cir. 1990). For the reasons \nnoted, I cannot find that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant \nsecurity-clearance eligibility at this time. \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.c: \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances, it not is clearly consistent with the national \ninterest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security clearance. Eligibility for access to \nclassified information is denied. \n \n \n_____________________ \nElizabeth M. Matchinski \nAdministrative Judge \n",

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant is 27 years old, single, and has no children. He received a high school diploma in June 2010, and he has attended some college courses. He has worked for a defense contractor since June 2016, and this is his first security clearance application. Applicant started using and purchasing marijuana in 2010, when he was approximately 18 years old. He has admitted to using and purchasing marijuana until at least May 2016. In September 2012, Applicant was arrested and charged with possession of an illegal substance with the intent to distribute. He disclosed this arrest in his June 2016 SCA. The charges were ultimately dismissed. (Item 4 at 15-16) The arresting officers noted that they saw a passenger in Applicant\u2019s car pass him a joint of marijuana, and Applicant admitted that he used marijuana while operating his vehicle. They detected a strong odor of marijuana when they approached Applicant\u2019s car. The officers found several discarded marijuana roaches, a burning marijuana joint, multiple baggies of marijuana, and other drug-related paraphernalia in Applicant\u2019s car. The two other individuals in the car were also arrested, and one admitted to the arresting officers that he had recently been arrested for selling marijuana. (Item 6) In his PSI, Applicant claimed two individuals paid him to give them a ride in his car.

Temple, Esq., Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro se \n \n______________ \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \n \nHEINTZELMAN, Caroline E., Administrative Judge: \n \nApplicant failed to mitigate the drug involvement and substance abuse and \npersonal conduct, and criminal conduct security concerns. National security eligibility for \naccess to classified information is denied.  \n \nHistory of the Case \n \nApplicant submitted a security clearance application (SCA) on June 30, 2016. On \nMarch 20, 2018, the Department of Defense (DOD) issued a Statement of Reasons \n(SOR) alleging security concerns under Guideline H, Drug Involvement and Substance \nAbuse, Guideline E, Personal Conduct, and Guideline J, Criminal Conduct. Applicant \nanswered the SOR on April 26, 2018 (Answer), and requested a decision on the record \nwithout a hearing.  \n \nOn June 25, 2018, a complete copy of the File of Relevant Material (FORM), \ncontaining seven Items, was mailed to Applicant. The FORM notified Applicant that he \nhad an opportunity to file objections and submit material in refutation, extenuation, or \nmitigation within 30 days of his receipt of the FORM. Applicant did not respond to the \nFORM. Items 1 through 7 are admitted into evidence. The case was assigned to me on \nOctober 29, 2018.  \n \n  12/13/2018\n\n \n \n2\nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant is 27 years old, single, and has no children. He received a high school \ndiploma in June 2010, and he has attended some college courses. He has worked for a \ndefense contractor since June 2016, and this is his first security clearance application. \n \n Applicant started using and purchasing marijuana in 2010, when he was \napproximately 18 years old. He has admitted to using and purchasing marijuana until at \nleast May 2016. \n \nIn September 2012, Applicant was arrested and charged with possession of an \nillegal substance with the intent to distribute. He disclosed this arrest in his June 2016 \nSCA. The charges were ultimately dismissed. (Item 4 at 15-16) \n \nThe arresting officers noted that they saw a passenger in Applicant\u2019s car pass him \na joint of marijuana, and Applicant admitted that he used marijuana while operating his \nvehicle. They detected a strong odor of marijuana when they approached Applicant\u2019s car. \nThe officers found several discarded marijuana roaches, a burning marijuana joint, \nmultiple baggies of marijuana, and other drug-related paraphernalia in Applicant\u2019s car. \nThe two other individuals in the car were also arrested, and one admitted to the arresting \nofficers that he had recently been arrested for selling marijuana. (Item 6)  \n \nIn his PSI, Applicant claimed two individuals paid him to give them a ride in his car. \nWhen the police searched his car they found a bag of marijuana, it did not belong to him, \nbut he was aware it was in his vehicle. The charges against Applicant were dropped after \nthe presiding judge determined that the search and seizure during the arrest was illegal. \n(Item 4 at 15-16) \n \nApplicant did not disclose his history of using and purchasing marijuana in his June \n2016 SCA. (Item 3 at 35) During his September 2017 PSI, Applicant told the government \ninvestigator that he purchased and smoked three to five joints of marijuana a week from \nSeptember 2010 until May 2016. He did not list this information on his SCA, because he \nwas concerned he would lose his job. Additionally, he told the investigator that he does \nnot intend to use marijuana in the future. (Item 4 at 16-17) \n \nPolicies \n \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d1 As Commander in Chief, the \nPresident has the authority to \u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security \nand to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such \ninformation.\u201d2 The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to \n                                                          \n1 Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). \n \n2 Egan at 527. \n \n\n \n \n3\ngrant applicants eligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it \nis clearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d3 \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the AG. These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, \nrecognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge applies these \nguidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative \njudge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available and reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable. \n \n \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nAdverse clearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and \nshall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d4 Thus, \na decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant has not met \nthe strict guidelines the President and the Security Executive Agent have established for \nissuing national security eligibility. \n \n \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR.5 \u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than \na scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d6 The guidelines presume a nexus or rational \nconnection between proven conduct under any of the criteria listed therein and an \napplicant\u2019s security suitability.7 Once the Government establishes a disqualifying \ncondition, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts.8 An applicant has the burden of proving a potential mitigating condition, and the \nburden of disproving it never shifts to the Government.9 \n                                                          \n3 Executive Order (EO) 10865 \u00a7 2. \n \n4 EO 10865 \u00a7 7. \n \n5 Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14. \n \n6 See v. Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). \n \n7  See, e.g. ISCR Case No. 15-01253 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2016). \n \n8 Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. \n \n9 ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \n\n \n \n4\n  \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d10 \u201c[S]ecurity \nclearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d11 \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline H: Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nAG \u00b6 24 expresses the security concern pertaining to drug involvement: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, but because such behavior may \nlead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. Controlled substance means any \u201ccontrolled substance\u201d \nas defined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term adopted \nin this guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above. \nAG \u00b6 25 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and be \ndisqualifying in this case: \n(a) any substance misuse (see above definition); and \n \n(c) illegal possession of a controlled substance, including cultivation, \nprocessing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of \ndrug paraphernalia. \n \nApplicant admitted he purchased and used marijuana two to three times a week \nfor almost six years. The record evidence raised both disqualifying conditions. \n \nThe burden shifted to Appellant to rebut or prove mitigation of the resulting security \nconcerns. AG \u00b6 26 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns in this case: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not \ncast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; and \n                                                          \n \n10 ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002); Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. \n \n11 Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see also AG \u00b6 2(b). \n \n\n \n \n5\n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and substance \nmisuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and \nhas established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not limited to: \n \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; \n \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs used; and \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that any future \ninvolvement or misuse is grounds for revocation of national security \neligibility. \nGiven Applicant\u2019s frequency of marijuana use, his period of abstinence is \ninsufficient to mitigate his lengthy history of use. He told the government investigator that \nhe no longer associates with the people with whom he used marijuana, but there is limited \ncorroborating evidence that Applicant has changed his lifestyle and behavior. Mitigation \nwas not established under AG \u00b6\u00b6 26(a) and 26(b). \n \nGuideline E: Personal Conduct \n \nThe concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 15: \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. The following will normally result in \nan unfavorable national security eligibility determination, security clearance \naction, or cancellation of further processing for national security eligibility: \n \n(a) refusal, or failure without reasonable cause, to undergo or \ncooperate with security processing, including but not limited \nto meeting with a security investigator for subject interview, \ncompleting security forms or releases, cooperation with \nmedical \nor \npsychological \nevaluation, \nor \npolygraph \nexamination, if authorized and required; and \n \n(b) refusal to provide full, frank, and truthful answers to lawful \nquestions of investigators, security officials, or other official \nrepresentatives in connection with a personnel security or \ntrustworthiness determination. \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and be \ndisqualifying. The following is potentially applicable in this case: \n\n \n \n6\n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar \nform used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, \naward benefits or status, determine national security eligibility or \ntrustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities. \n \nIn this case, Appellant admitted that he intentionally falsified his SCA. The \nevidence established the above disqualifying condition. \nAG \u00b6 17 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and be \ndisqualifying. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; and \n \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment. \n \nApplicant failed to disclose derogatory information regarding use of marijuana in \nhis SCA. Over a year later, he admitted during his PSI that he did not disclose his drug \nuse because he was afraid his history would affect his ability to hold his job. The \ngovernment relies upon applicants to be honest and forthright during the security \napplication process. Applicant was not honest regarding his extensive period of marijuana \nuse. There is no evidence that he made proactive efforts to disclose this derogatory \ninformation to his employer in the fifteen months between his completion of the SCA and \nhis PSI. Mitigation was not established under AG \u00b6\u00b6 17(a) and 17(c).    \n \nGuideline J: Criminal Conduct  \n \nAG \u00b6 30 expresses the security concerns pertaining to criminal conduct: \n \nCriminal activity creates doubt about a person's judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person's ability or \nwillingness to comply with laws, rules and regulations. \n \nAG \u00b6 31 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. The following is potentially applicable in this case: \n \n(a) a pattern of minor offenses, any one of which on its own would be \nunlikely to affect a national security eligibility decision, but which in \ncombination cast doubt on the individual's judgment, reliability, or \ntrustworthiness; and \n \n \nAppellant\u2019s drug-related 2012 arrest establishes the above disqualifying condition.  \n\n \n \n7\n \nAG \u00b6 32 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns raised in this \ncase. The following two are potentially applicable: \n \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur and \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; and \n \n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including, but not limited \nto, the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, restitution, \ncompliance with the terms of parole or probation, job training or higher \neducation, \ngood \nemployment \nrecord, \nor \nconstructive \ncommunity \ninvolvement. \n \n \nIt has been over six years since Applicant\u2019s 2012 arrest. However, he continued to \nuse and purchase marijuana until May 2016. Mitigation under AG \u00b6\u00b6 32(a) and 32(d) was \nnot established. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether the granting or continuing \nof national security eligibility is clearly consistent with the interests of national security \nmust be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful consideration of the \nfollowing guidelines, each of which is to be evaluated in the context of the whole person. \nAn administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \n\u00b6 2(d): \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nI have incorporated my comments under the guidelines at issue in my whole-\nperson analysis, and I have considered the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). After weighing the \ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions under this guideline, and evaluating all the \nevidence in the context of the whole person, Applicant has not mitigated the drug \ninvolvement and personal conduct security concerns, but he did mitigate the criminal \nconduct security concerns.  \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n8\nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline H:   \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.c:  \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline J:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nParagraph 3, Guideline E:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 3.a \u2013 3.b:  \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the interests of national security of \nthe United States to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified \ninformation. National security eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n__________________________ \nCAROLINE E. HEINTZELMAN \nAdministrative Judge \n \n \n",

Thompson, Esq., Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro Se \n02/19/2019\n______________ \nDecision \n______________ \nCREAN, Thomas M., Administrative Judge: \nBased on a review of the pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility for access \nto classified information is denied. Applicant did not present sufficient information and \ndocuments to mitigate financial considerations security concerns. \nStatement of the Case \nOn March 13, 2017, Applicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaire for \nInvestigations Processing (e-QIP) to retain a security clearance required for a position \nwith a contractor for a government agency. After reviewing the background \ninvestigation, the Department of Defense (DOD) could not make the affirmative findings \nrequired to grant a security clearance. DOD issued to Applicant a Statement of Reasons \n(SOR), dated January 23, 2018, detailing security concerns for financial considerations \nunder Guideline F. The action was taken under Executive Order E.O.) 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; \nDOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review \nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines \n(AG) effective in the DOD on June 8, 2017.  \n\n  2 \n \nApplicant answered the SOR on March 5, 2018. She admitted the six allegations \nof delinquent debt, but contested the amount of the debt in SOR 1.d. Department \nCounsel was prepared to proceed on March 23, 2018, and I was assigned the case on \nJuly 19, 2018. DOD issued a notice of hearing on September 21, 2018, for a hearing on \nOctober 25, 2018. I convened the hearing as scheduled. The Government\u2019s two exhibits \n(GX 1-2) were admitted into the record without objection. Applicant testified, and \nintroduced three exhibits (AX A-C) that were admitted into the record without objection. I \nleft the record open for Applicant to submit additional documents. Applicant timely \nsubmitted four additional documents that I marked and admitted into the record as AX D \nthrough G. Department Counsel had no objection to the admission of the documents. \n(GX 3, e-mail, dated November 16, 2018) I received the transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on \nNovember 2, 2018, and the record closed on November 16, 2018, on receipt of the \npost-hearing documents.   \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nAfter a thorough review of the pleadings, transcript, and exhibits, I make the \nfollowing findings of fact. Applicant is 36 years old. She graduated from high school in \n2000, and has completed studies for and received a real estate agent\u2019s license. She \nmarried in August 2007, and she and her husband had twins together. Her husband has \na child from a previous relationship. Her husband became disabled in 2010. He cannot \nwork and receives disability. Applicant and her husband do not live together, and he \ndoes not contribute on a recurrent basis to Applicant for family support.  \n \nApplicant has been an executive assistant for a government agency since 2002. \nShe received her first security clearance in 2002. Her monthly net pay is $3,600, with \nmonthly expenses of approximately $3,300, leave her approximately $300 monthly in \ndiscretionary income. (Tr. 13-21, 33-35; GX 1, E-QIP, dated March 13, 2017) \n \nThe SOR lists, and a credit report (GX 2, dated June 29, 2017) confirms the \nfollowing delinquent debts for Applicant: an automobile loan charged-off for $10,578 \n(SOR 1.a); another automobile loan in collection for $7,166 (SOR 1.b); a telephone \nservice debt in collection for $1,182 (SOR 1.c); a charged-off account for furniture for \n$1,057 (SOR 1.d); a utility debt in collection for $1,495 (SOR 1.e); and a communication \nservice debt in collection for $800 (SOR 1.f). The total amount of the delinquent debt is \napproximately $21,000.  \n \nApplicant stated that her financial problems started in 2010 when her husband \ncould not work because of a disability from a kidney transplant. Even though she was \nno longer responsible for support of her husband, she lost his income. She had twins in \n2010, becoming a single mother responsible for totally supporting her children on one \nincome. She did not have sufficient income to keep current with her bills. (Tr. 17-21) \n \nApplicant testified that she had been making the car payments associated with \nthe debt at SOR 1.a. She missed a few payments and the amount of the payments, \ninterest, and penalties were added to the end of her loan. She stated she did not know \n\n  3 \n \nthat the missed payments were accruing both penalties and interest. The balance of the \ndebt listed in the SOR includes the amount of the missed payments and the additional \nfees. The creditor requested full payment, but Applicant did not have the funds for the \nrequested payment. The creditor repossessed the car. Applicant does not believe she \nreceived credit for the value of the repossessed car. However, she did not provide any \ndocuments to verify any contact with the creditor establishing the reasons for the debt.  \n \nApplicant received a settlement offer of payment of $3,700 by March 2019. \nApplicant stated her intention to pay the settlement, but she did has not provided any \ndocumentation to establish that she made any payments towards the settlement \nagreement. (Tr. 21-25; AX A, Letter, dated October 5, 2018) \n \nThe debt at SOR 1.b is for a vehicle that Applicant cosigned for her husband. At \nthe time that he purchased the vehicle, her husband was working and he could afford \nthe vehicle. After purchasing the car, he required a kidney transplant and could no \nlonger work, and he could not afford to make payments on the vehicle. The creditor \nwanted full payment of the debt. Since Applicant only had one income, she could not \nafford to make the payments. Applicant reached a payment arrangement with the \ncreditor in October 2018 for payment of $100 per month on the debt. Applicant provided \na receipt for the one payment she made in October 2018. She stated her intention to \ncontinue to make payments. However, she has not provided any documents to verify \nshe that she has continued to make the payments. (Tr. 25-27) \n \nThe debt at SOR 1.c is for television-cable service. Most of the debt is for \nequipment that Applicant claims was returned. Applicant does not have a receipt to \nshow that she returned the equipment. However, Applicant\u2019s latest bill from the \ncompany received on November 16, 2018, is for $76.44. There is no listing in the bill for \nequipment. This indicates that the cost of the equipment has been paid or Applicant \nreceived credit for the equipment she returned. This debt is resolved for Applicant. (Tr. \n27-29; AX D, Bill, dated November 16, 2018) \n \nThe debt in collection at SOR 1.d is for furniture. Applicant claims to have made \npayments on the debt at the furniture store. She does not have a receipt for the \npayments, and she disputes the amount of the debt. She claims the debt is only \n$542.43 because of the payments she claims were made. She stated that she intends \nto pay the debt in monthly payments. She has not provided information to verify she has \ncontinued to make the payments. (Tr. 29)  \n \nApplicant has not made any payment on the utility debt at SOR 1.e. She plans to \nresolve the debt before the end of 2018. She did not provide any documents concerning \nany payments made on the debt. (Tr. 29-30) \n \nThe debt at SOR 1.f is for television-cable service that Applicant had at a \nprevious location. She believes the debt was paid, but she does not have a receipt. \nApplicant now has cable service with the same provider. Her latest bill shows that her \n\n  4 \n \npayments are current and that her current bill of $388.77 is a normal bill. This debt is \nresolved for Applicant. (Tr. 30-31; AX E, bill, dated November 1, 2018)  \n \nApplicant has not received financial counseling. She is current with her state and \nfederal taxes. She has no other debts than those listed on the SOR. (Tr. 31-32)  \n \nApplicant provided two letters of recommendation. Her present government \nsupervisor noted that Applicant has worked for her since 2009. Applicant\u2019s work has \nbeen consistent and without error. Her duties require a high level of confidentiality and \nfinancial oversight. She is entrusted with sensitive personnel information. Her supervisor \nis aware of Applicant\u2019s personal and family challenges. Applicant is not extravagant but \nis someone that is aiding a husband with a lifetime medical challenge. (AX F, Letter, \ndated November 5, 2018) \n \nThe second letter is from Applicant\u2019s immediate program manager and corporate \nsupervisor. He has known Applicant for four years. Applicant handles herself with \nprofessionalism, respect, and loyalty to the government client. She has proven herself \nworthy of having access to classified information. (AX G, Letter, dated October 31, \n2018).  \nPolicies \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which must be considered in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record.  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \n\n  5 \n \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . . .\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion in seeking a favorable security decision. \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nAnalysis \n \nFinancial Considerations: \n \n \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial obligations \nmay indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and \nregulations, all of which can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and ability to protect classified or sensitive information. An individual \nwho is financially irresponsible, may also be irresponsible, unconcerned, or careless in \nhis obligations to protect classified information. Behaving responsibly or irresponsibly in \none aspect of life provides an indication of how a person may behave in other aspects \nof life. An individual who is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in \nillegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. (AG \u00b6 18).  \n \n \nA person\u2019s relationship with his or her creditors is a private matter until evidence \nis uncovered demonstrating an inability or unwillingness to meet financial obligations. \nAbsent evidence of strong extenuating or mitigating circumstances, an applicant with a \nhistory of serious or recurring financial difficulties is in a situation of risk inconsistent \nwith the holding of a security clearance. An applicant is required to manage his or her \nfinances in such a way as to meet financial obligations.  \n \nAdverse information in credit reports can normally meet the substantial evidence \nstandard to establish financial delinquency. A Credit report confirms the delinquent \ndebts listed in the SOR. This information is sufficient to raise security concerns under \nFinancial Considerations Disqualifying Conditions AG \u00b6 19: \n \n \n(a) inability to satisfy debts,  \n \n \n(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so; and   \n \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations.  \n \n \nOnce the Government has established the adverse financial issue, the Applicant \nhas the responsibility to refute or mitigate the issue. Based on the information provided \n\n  6 \n \nby Applicant, I considered the following Financial Consideration Mitigating Conditions \nunder AG \u00b6 20: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problems were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g. loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce, or \nseparation, clear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity \ntheft), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem from \na legitimate and credible sources, such as a non-profit credit counselling \nservice, and there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved \nor is under control; \n \n(d) the individual has initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to \nrepay the overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue.  \n \n \nThe mitigating conditions apply only in part and not to all the debts. Applicant\u2019s \ndebts are recent, numerous and not resolved. Applicant did not provide information \nconcerning financial counseling or participation in any debt-relief programs. Applicant\u2019s \ndebts may have been partially caused by her husband\u2019s illness that prevents him from \nworking and providing support to the family. Her husband is on disability and does not \nlive with her. She is raising their two children by herself. His condition and her lack of \nsupport from him is and will be recurring.  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s husband\u2019s disability is a condition beyond her control, but her failure \nto pay her debts under her financial circumstances casts doubt on her current reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and good judgment. She has not established that she acted responsibly \ntowards her debts under the circumstances. She has discretionary funds each month to \nuse for debt payments, but she has not provided information to show she is using the \nfunds to pay debts. She has car-loan debt that is not resolved because she failed to \nstay current with car payments when due. She did not provide documents to show she \nis making payments on another car loan that she cosigned. While she established that \ntwo communication service debts are current, she has not provided sufficient \ndocumentation to establish and verify that she paid utility and furniture debts. In other \n\n  7 \n \nwords, she has not established that she took reasonable and adequate action to resolve \nher debts when she had sufficient income. \n \n \nGood faith means acting in a way that shows reasonableness, prudence, \nhonesty, and adherence to duty and obligation. Applicant is not required to be debt-free \nnor must her plan require paying off all debts immediately or simultaneously. All that is \nrequired is that Applicant act responsibly given her circumstances. Applicant must \nestablish that she has a reasonable plan to resolve financial problems, and that she has \ntaken significant action to implement that plan. Applicant\u2019s plan must show a systematic \nmethod of handling debts, and Applicant must establish a meaningful track record of \ndebt payment. A promise to pay delinquent debts is not a substitute for a track record of \npaying debts in a timely manner and acting in a financially responsible manner.  \n \nApplicant did not provide information to establish that she resolved the debts \nalleged in the SOR except for the communication debts listed at SOR 1.c, and 1.f. \nApplicant did not present any information to establish that she has a plan indicating how \nshe will pay or resolve the remaining debts. Applicant has been gainfully employed \nsince at least 2009. Her income is significant and she seems to have sufficient income \nto make progress in resolving her delinquent debts. She has not presented any \nevidence of a budget and the state of her finances.  \n \nApplicant did not establish that she acted reasonably under the circumstances. \nExcept for the communication debts, Applicant presented no evidence of debt payments \nor resolution of other debts. She did not develop or present plans to pay her remaining \ndelinquent debts. She did not provide documentation to show continued payments of \nher debts or correspondence with creditors to establish she is in contact with them, \ncopies of debt disputes, evidence of attempts to negotiate payment plans, or other \nevidence of progress or resolution. There is no clear evidence that her debt problems \nhave been resolved, so her finances are not under control. There is insufficient \nevidence to establish why Applicant was unable to make greater progress resolving her \ndebts.  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s ability to resolve her financial problems seem to be within her means \nand control. Since she did not present a plan to resolve her financial problems or make \nan effort to pay or resolve her delinquent debts, she has not established a good-faith \neffort to pay her debts. Her lack of reasonable and responsible actions towards her \nfinances is a strong indication that she will not protect and safeguard classified or \nsensitive information. Applicant did not present sufficient information to mitigate financial \nsecurity concerns. \n \n \n \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n\n  8 \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I considered the letters of \nrecommendation from Applicant\u2019s supervisors. However, Applicant did not present \nsufficient and adequate evidence to establish that she took reasonable and responsible \naction to resolve her financial obligations. Applicant did not demonstrate appropriate \nmanagement of her finances and did not show a record of action to resolve financial \nissues. Overall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts concerning \nApplicant\u2019s judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. She has not established her \nsuitability for access to classified information. For all these reasons, I conclude \nApplicant failed to mitigate the security concerns arising from her financial situation. \nEligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a -1.b: \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.c:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.d \u2013 1.e:  \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.f:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n\n  9 \n \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n \n_________________ \nTH0MAS M. CREAN \nAdministrative Judge \n \n",

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant is a 54-year-old program lead/project manager who has served in the same capacity for over three-and-a-half years. She has earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in project management, as well as a master\u2019s degree in project management and information technology. She also earned a second master\u2019s degree in cyber forensics. She is single and has no children. There is no evidence of formal financial counseling. From October 1985 to November 1989, Applicant served on active duty in the United States military. After a period of time as a reservist, she returned to active duty in early 1992, where she remained until retirement at the level of E-7 in November 2008. From that time until March 2013, she was employed by a defense contractor. From March 2013 until May 2014, Applicant was unemployed before accepting a brief temporary position in order to generate income. She was then intermittently unemployed from August 2014 to September 2015. Unemployed from October 2015 until December 2015, she accepted her present position at the end of 2015.

The action was taken \nunder Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry \n(February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel \nSecurity Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the \nadjudicative guidelines (AG) effective within the DOD on or after June 8, 2017. \n \nIn a response notarized on November 13, 2018, Applicant admitted all \nallegations. She also requested a hearing before a Defense Office of Hearings and \nAppeals (DOHA) administrative judge. I was assigned the case on March 7, 2019.  \n \nOn June 5, 2018, a notice was issued setting the hearing for June 12, 2019. \nApplicant waived her right to 15 days notice and chose to proceed on the available date. \nThe hearing was convened as scheduled. The Government offered five exhibits (Exs.), \nnoted as Exs. 1-5, and Applicant presented 12 documents, marked as Exs. A-L. With no \nobjections, all exhibits were accepted into the record. Applicant was granted through \nJune 24, 2019, to submit any additional materials. The transcript (Tr.) was received on \n\n \n \n \n \n2\nJune 25, 2019. After a request for an extension of time was granted, a final file of \nmaterials was offered by Applicant and admitted without objection as Exs. M-T on July \n9, 2019. The record was then closed. Based on the testimony, materials, and record as \na whole, I find Applicant mitigated security concerns. \n \n     Findings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant is a 54-year-old program lead/project manager who has served in the \nsame capacity for over three-and-a-half years. She has earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in \nproject management, as well as a master\u2019s degree in project management and \ninformation technology. She also earned a second master\u2019s degree in cyber forensics. \nShe is single and has no children. There is no evidence of formal financial counseling. \n \n \nFrom October 1985 to November 1989, Applicant served on active duty in the \nUnited States military. After a period of time as a reservist, she returned to active duty in \nearly 1992, where she remained until retirement at the level of E-7 in November 2008. \nFrom that time until March 2013, she was employed by a defense contractor. From \nMarch 2013 until May 2014, Applicant was unemployed before accepting a brief \ntemporary position in order to generate income. She was then intermittently \nunemployed from August 2014 to September 2015. Unemployed from October 2015 \nuntil December 2015, she accepted her present position at the end of 2015.  (Tr. 57)  \n \n \nAt issue are six delinquent debts, five of which are related to federal or state \ntaxes. In both types of obligations, tax liabilities were acquired which Applicant had \ninsufficient income or resources to pay. (Tr. 34) Her federal tax issues are reflected in \nthe SOR at allegations 1.a ($11,554 November 2015 tax lien for tax year 2014 taxes \nowed), 1.b ($2,788 for related sums owed for tax year 2013), and 1.c ($10,598 for \nunpaid tax from tax year 2014).  \n \nApplicant began corresponding with the Government concerning her federal tax \nissues in 2015. (Tr. 51, 53) Other strides were made in 2016 and in 2017 to address her \nfederal tax obligations and work out a settlement or reduction. By August 2018, she \nstarted making arrangements to commence a comprehensive repayment agreement \nwith the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). (Tr. 49, 51) The IRS dallied in arranging a \nrepayment terms. Applicant had no objection to the delays because she \u201cknew that if \n[she] started paying [the debt balance] back, the chances of them  offering any type of \nforgiveness of the early withdrawal fees, penalties, interest, and so on was nil, once \n[she] started paying.\u201d (Tr. 50, 53) Consequently, she did not push the issue because \nshe hoped her liability would be reduced to just the taxes originally owed. \n \nIn May 2019, she tried to contact the IRS by telephone \u201cto determine the status \n[of the debt] because she had not seen any correspondence\u201d in recent months \nconveying any information except the IRS needed more time to evaluate her situation. \n(Tr. 50) She then discovered that the case had been closed with no action by the IRS to \nreduce the amount owed, and that the matter had been transferred to collections. (Tr. \n50) Consequently, payment of $200 on an installment agreement with the IRS was \n\n \n \n \n \n3\nmade toward her 2013 tax balance on May 21, 2019, followed by another payment in \nearly June 2019. (Ex. C at 5)  \n \nApplicant showed all taxes owed for 2013 (1.b) have been paid and, at this point, \nshe has a credit of $420.22 on that account. (Ex. M at 2) However, a related lien (1.b) \n\u201cwill not be released now until ALL back taxes, penalties, and interest have been paid.\u201d \n(emphasis in the original) (Ex. J) As for the tax liabilities owed for tax year 2014 (1.c), its \nremaining balance, which includes accrued penalties and interest, is in repayment as \nper the payment plan implemented in May 2019 and referenced above. (Ex. M) \n \nApplicant also owed her state sums at SOR allegations 1.d ($3,766 for a tax lien \ndated March 2015) and 1.e ($3,598 for unpaid state taxes). She provided \ndocumentation showing that the lien at 1.d has been satisfied and released. (Ex. Q) She \nalso showed that a repayment plan on the debt noted at 1.e was initially implemented \naround September 2017, then a payment schedule was initiated. A new arrangement \nwas then established in August 2018. (Exs. R-S) Applicant showed she is currently in \ngood standing on that plan. (Ex. S) As of July 3, 2019, Applicant owed a balance of \nabout $812. (Ex. T) Applicant also provided a copy of a July 3, 2019, check dated July \n3, 2019, and made out for the sum of approximately $213 to be sent to her state \ncomptroller toward that balance. (Ex. T)  \n \n In addition, Applicant has a sixth delinquent debt at issue. It is for $232,919 and \nis related to student loans obtained between 2009 and 2017 (1.f). At the time of the \nOctober 4, 2018, SOR, they were noted as being in forbearance until approximately \nOctober 2018. Applicant finished her education in 2017. Payments were deferred during \nher enrollment. She then had them in forbearance due to her circumstances. (Tr. 55) \nApplicant showed that the related loans were subsequently taken out of forbearance \nand have been in timely repayment. (Ex. E at 14-24) She currently pays approximately \n$644 a month on the total balance due.  \n \nAt present, Applicant is generating sufficient income to meet her regular \nobligations while making strides on her tax and student loan obligations. She has a \nmonthly net remainder of about $940, which she puts into savings or into her budgeting \nfor future payments. (Tr. 59) She bought a new car in 2017 in order to replace an older \nmodel and secure safer travel for the approximately 94,000 miles she puts on her \nvehicle per year commuting. She uses credit cards less, and otherwise tends to \neconomize. Applicant recently sold a horse which had health issues, thus yielding her \nsavings from veterinary and other care. \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n\n \n \n \n \n4\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Recognizing the complexities of \nhuman behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the \nadjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, \nimpartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a \nconscientious scrutiny of variables known as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that any doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to classified \ninformation will be resolved in favor of national security. In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence.  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an applicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours. The Government reposes a high degree of \ntrust and confidence in those granted access to classified information. Decisions \nnecessarily include consideration of the possible risk an applicant may deliberately or \ninadvertently fail to safeguard such information. Decisions shall be in terms of the \nnational interest and do not question the loyalty of an applicant.  \n \nAnalysis \n \nUnder Guideline F, AG \u00b6 18 sets forth that the security concern under this \nguideline is that failure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to \nabide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about an individual\u2019s \nreliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified or sensitive information.  \n \nHere, the Government offered documentary evidence reflecting that Applicant \nhas numerous delinquent debts. This is sufficient to invoke financial considerations \ndisqualifying conditions:  \n \nAG \u00b6 19(a): inability to satisfy debts; \n \nAG \u00b6 19(b): unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the inability to do \nso;  \n \nAG \u00b6 19(c): a history of not meeting financial obligations, and  \n \n\n \n \n \n \n5\nAG \u00b6 19(f): failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local \nincome tax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax as required. \n \nLacking disputes or evidence of financial counseling, three conditions could mitigate the \nfinance related security concerns posed here:  \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not \ncast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were \nlargely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances, and \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to \nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s financial distress began with a period of unemployment lasting from \nMarch 2013 to May 2014. She subsequently experienced other, shorter, periods of \nunemployment before starting her current work. The evidence shows her tax issues first \narose in tax year 2013. It also shows that she began working with federal and state tax \nauthorities by 2014. While she may have tarried as the IRS protracted reviewing her \nmaterials, a position she admits was designed to keep the possibility of reduced \npenalties open, it was not the result of inaction or obfuscation on her part. Ultimately, \nwhen she discovered the IRS had referred her case for collection, she assured \npayments were ready for deposit. Meanwhile, she satisfied her state tax obligation and \nis finishing her payment on the minor balance remaining for related fees. Meanwhile, \nshe kept her student loans in forbearance, as appropriate, until time for them to be \nsubject to payment. She proved that she has been and is presently in timely repayment \non her student loan debt. This is sufficient to raise AG \u00b6 20(b) and AG \u00b6 20(d).  \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of her conduct \nand all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d). Here, I have considered those factors. I \nam also mindful that, under AG \u00b6 2(a), the ultimate determination of whether to grant \neligibility for a security clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based on \ncareful consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.        \n \n\n \n \n \n \n6\nApplicant is a 54-year-old program lead/project manager who has served in the \nsame capacity for over three years. She has a bachelor\u2019s degree and two master\u2019s \ndegrees related to her work specialty. Single and with no children, Applicant retired from \nthe U.S. military in 2008. When her first civilian position ended in 2013, she endured a \nlengthy period of unemployment, followed by a multiple periods of employment and \nunemployment, until beginning her present position at the end of 2015. \n \nThe evidence shows that while Applicant may have tarried in addressing her \nfederal and state tax issues, she did not delay in contacting them or working with them. \nIndeed, she admits she did not press the protracted efforts of the IRS in hopes that the \ndelay would yield some reduction in the amount she owed. All this occurred before the \nSOR was issued. Once advised her federal tax bill had been referred for collection, she \ndirectly started making payments on that debt. Evidence of her first two months of \npayments to the IRS, plus evidence of her success addressing her state tax balance \nand student loans, were apparent by the time of her hearing.  \n \nToday, Applicant\u2019s tax year 2013 balance is paid, and she is making regular \npayments to satisfy her much-reduced balance owed to the IRS. Her state tax liability is \nalso reduced to less than $1,000 and in repayment.  Her student loans are in timely \nrepayment. With economizing, she now has a considerable monthly net remainder to \nassure her ability to meet her monthly obligations. While financial counseling would \ngreatly benefit her given the fact she still uses credit cards, it is clear she has her \nfinances under control. Consequently, I find Applicant has mitigated financial \nconsiderations security concerns.  \n \n   Formal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.f: \n \n \nFor Applicant \n                       \n \n \n \n     Conclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant a security clearance. \nEligibility for access to classified information is granted. \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nArthur E.

On April 20, 2018, the Department of Defense (DOD) \nConsolidated Adjudications Facility (CAF) issued to her a Statement of Reasons (SOR) \ndetailing concerns under Guideline F (Financial Considerations).1 In a response dated \nJanuary 22, 2018, she admitted seven of 16 allegations and requested a determination \nbased on the written record. On April 20, 2018, the Government issued a File of Relevant \nMaterial (FORM) with eight attachments (\u201cItems\u201d). The case was assigned to me on July \n26, 2018. Based on my review of the record as a whole, I find Applicant failed to mitigate \nfinancial considerations trustworthiness concerns. \n Findings of Fact \nApplicant is a 53-year-old administrative assistant and consultant. Married for the \nthird time, she is the mother of four adult children and two adult stepchildren. At issue are \n16 delinquent debts totaling about $80,000, as gleaned from her security clearance \napplication (SCA) and credit reports submitted as Items 4 and 6 of the FORM. The \n1 The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry \n(February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance \nReview Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) effective \nwithin the DOD on or after June 8, 2017. \n03/25/2019\n\n \n \n \n \n2 \noverwhelming majority of these debts, about $68,558, consist of federal and state taxes \nowed (SOR allegations 1.c-1.f) Applicant cites the origin of many of these delinquent \ndebts to a failed home remodeling business run by her second husband when she lived \nwith him in about 2009, as well as to medical debts accumulated when she had no health \ninsurance coverage.    \n \nAt issue in the SOR are the following delinquent debts: \n \n1.a \u2013 Collection account ($552) \u2013 Addressed. This balance and those noted below \nat 1.h ($1,160) and 1.j ($335) are related, consisting of the underlying debt and \ntwo collection efforts. While it is unclear how or when they were combined, \nApplicant provided a November 2017 receipt reflecting both entity names, \npayments of $1,381.48, and a showing the balance due is now zero. (FORM, Ex. \nA) \n \n1.b \u2013 Collection account ($286) \u2013 Addressed. This account was settled by payment \nof $184.69 in February 20018. (FORM, Ex. B) \n \n1.c-1.d \u2013 State tax liens ($28,291, $4,490) \u2013 In repayment. Applicant wrote that \nthese 2009 business taxes were \u201crolled in\u201d with personal income taxes from 2010 \nand 2012. (FORM Response Narrative) Applicant explained that her portion of this \ndebt, as opposed to that owed by her second husband, is $10,667.38. She \nprovided a copy of a payment schedule and evidence of $446 debit payments \nsince July 2017.  \n \n1.e-1.f \u2013 Federal tax liens ($3,209, $32,568) \u2013 No progress shown. On some \nunspecified date, Applicant was told by a representative at the Internal Revenue \nService (IRS) that as of October 2014, these 2007, 2009, and 2010 personal \nincome taxes were no longer collectible. She wrote: \u201cThey could accept voluntary \npayments but would not create a payment agreement and would not track any \npayments.\u201d She also wrote that the IRS\u2019 \u201conly solution . . . would be to create a \n\u2018mirror\u2019 account which would separate my-ex-husband and myself and allow me to \npay toward the total, showing my payments. A mirror account would take 90 days \nto create.\u201d Applicant provided no documentary evidence substantiating where the \nstatus of these liens last was. (SOR Response Narrative) A February 2018 IRS \nletter shows the unpaid balances for 2007, 2009, and 2010 uncollectable because \nApplicant \u201ccan\u2019t pay the money you owe at this time. . . .\u201d (Supplemental FORM \nResponse) It reflects $34,370.71 remains at issue. \n \n1.g \u2013 Medical collection ($2,553) \u2013 No documentary evidence. The balance is \nowed to a periodontist. Applicant ceased making payments on the balance in early \n2013. Applicant wrote she would commence making payments on the balance until \npaid, but provided no documentary evidence to that effect. (Ex. D) \n \n1.h \u2013 see 1.a above. \n \n\n \n \n \n \n3 \n1.i \u2013 Medical collection ($400) \u2013 Addressed. Applicant satisfied this debt by \npayment of the settlement amount of $133.64 in December 2016. (Ex. E) A second \nreceipt from that date shows the balance as paid in full on deposit of $724. \n(Supplemental FORM Response) This account appears to be merged with the one \nbelow at 1.p. \n \n1.j - see 1.a \n \n1.k \u2013 Medical collection ($300) \u2013 Status unclear. Applicant provided a copy of an \nacknowledgement to debit $100 from Applicant\u2019s account toward this surgical \npractice in December 2016. A handwritten notation indicates \u201cpd in full 12/16,\u201d but \nit is unclear if this is a settlement offer or even whether the $100 was drawn. An \naccompanying bank statement from April 2016 provides little insight. \n1.l \u2013 Medical collection ($3,805) - No documentary evidence. Applicant wrote that \nthis delinquent balance was sufficiently old that she had to request it be put back \non the provider\u2019s books. It is unclear when or if this action transpired. She further \nconveyed she does not have to make monthly payments, currently owes $3,5479, \nand plans to pay the balance within the next two years.  \n \n1.m \u2013 Medical collection ($485) \u2013 Addressed. Applicant offered a page from an \nExperian credit report showing: this account with an original balance of $485, \npayments made between September 2016 through January 2017, a handwritten \nnotation stating \u201cpaid 12/15/16,\u201d and no past due amount owed. The account was \nopened in 2014. Based on the payments made and lack of outstanding balance, it \nis probable this debt was paid.   \n \n1.n \u2013 Medical collection ($1,047) Unaddressed \u2013 No documentary evidenced of \nprogress by Applicant. \n \n1.o \u2013 Medical collection ($228) Unaddressed \u2013 No documentary evidenced of \nprogress by Applicant. \n \n1.p \u2013 Medical collection ($668) \u2013 see 1.i above. \n \nPolicies \n \nIn this matter, The Security Executive Agent Directive (SEAD) 4, National Security \nAdjudicative Guidelines (AG), effective June 8, 2017, is controlling. The DOD considers \nADP positions to be \u201csensitive positions.\u201d For a person to be eligible for sensitive duties, \nthe person\u2019s loyalty, reliability, and trustworthiness must be such that assigning the \nperson to a sensitive position is clearly consistent with the national security interests of \nthe United States. AG \u00b6 2.c. Applicants for ADP positions are entitled to the procedural \nprotections in the Directive before any final unfavorable access determination is made. \n(Under Secretary of Defense\u2019s Memorandum for the Director, Defense Office of Hearings \nand Appeals, dated November 19, 2004)  \n\n \n \n \n \n4 \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a public trust position, the \nadministrative judge must consider the disqualifying and mitigating conditions in the AG. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of \nhuman behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the \nwhole person. The administrative judge\u2019s adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and \ncommonsense decision. An administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable.  \n \nA public trust position decision resolves whether it is clearly consistent with the \ninterests of national security to grant or continue an applicant\u2019s access to sensitive \ninformation. The Government must prove, by substantial evidence, controverted facts \nalleged in the SOR. If it does, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, \nextenuate, or mitigate the facts. The applicant bears the heavy burden of demonstrating \nthat it is clearly consistent with the national security interest of the United States to grant \nor continue his or her access to sensitive information.  \n \nPersons with access to sensitive information enter into a fiduciary relationship with \nthe Government based on trust and confidence. Thus, the Government has a compelling \ninterest in ensuring each applicant possesses the requisite judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness of those who must protect national security as their own. The \u201cclearly \nconsistent with the interests of national security\u201d standard requires that \u201cany doubt \nconcerning personnel being considered for national security eligibility will be resolved in \nfavor of the national security.\u201d AG \u00b6 2(b). An eligibility for a public trust position decision \nis not a determination of the loyalty of the applicant concerned. It is merely an indication \nthat the applicant has or has not met the strict guidelines the Government has established \nfor issuing access to sensitive information. \n \nAnalysis \n \nUnder Guideline F, AG \u00b6 18 sets forth that the security concern under this guideline \nis that failure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to abide by \nrules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and ability to protect classified or sensitive information.  \n \nApplicant has numerous delinquent debts and both Federal and state tax-related \nliens. This is sufficient to invoke financial considerations disqualifying conditions:  \n \nAG \u00b6 19(a): inability to satisfy debts; \n \nAG \u00b6 19(b): unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the inability to do \nso;  \n \nAG \u00b6 19(c): a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \n \n\n \n \n \n \n5 \nAG \u00b6 19(f): failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local \nincome tax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax a required.  \n \nFive conditions could mitigate the finance related security concerns posed:  \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not \ncast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(b): the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(c): the person has received or is receiving counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; and \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(d): the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to \nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \n \n \nAs a threshold issue, it is noted that Applicant\u2019s second husband had business \nproblems that seem to have adversely affected Applicant\u2019s finances. It is also noted that \nmultiple debts were incurred because Applicant lacked medical insurance. However, \ninsufficient information and documentary evidence was introduced to show she acted \nresponsibly at the time the debts were incurred. At best, AG \u00b6 20(b) applies in part \nregarding the creation of the debts at issue.  \n \nThere is documentary evidence reflecting attempts to address those debts over a \nthree-year period. Between 2016 and 2018, Applicant addressed in varying degrees the \ndelinquent debts at 1.a, 1.b, 1.h, 1.i, 1.j., 1.m, and 1.p. She also instituted a repayment \nplan for the state lien obligations noted at 1.c-1.d. The rest, including about $35,000 in \nunaddressed federal tax liens, either remain unpaid or lack documentary evidence \nreflecting effort on the part of Applicant. Applicant\u2019s current financial condition is unclear, \nbut it is shown that the IRS determined Applicant is presently unable to make payments \non her tax balance. Further, there is no documentary evidence reflecting she has received \nfinancial counseling. Under these circumstances, it is difficult to surmise that Applicant is \nadhering to a holistic debt resolution or financial rehabilitation plan, has her debts \ncurrently under control, or has the present ability to do more to address her delinquent \nobligations. At best, I find AG \u00b6 20(d) applies in part. Lacking evidence of financial \ncounseling or that Applicant is adhering to an organized plan for addressing the debts at \nissue, none of the other conditions apply.  \n\n \n \n \n \n6 \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nadjudicative process factors listed in the AG. Under AG \u00b6 2(a), the need to utilize a \u201cwhole-\nperson\u201d evaluation is set forth. I considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating \nconditions in light of all the facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I incorporated \nmy comments under the guideline at issue in my whole-person analysis.  \n \nApplicant is a 53-year-old administrative assistant and consultant. She is the \nmarried mother of four adult children and two adult stepchildren. At issue are 16 \ndelinquent debts totaling $80,377. Of that sum, Applicant has shown progress or payment \non nearly half of the debts in the past three years. State tax obligations in the amount of \nabout $52,000 from about a decade ago are now in repayment with highly reasonable \nmonthly payments of less than $500.  \n \nWhat remains worrisome is how Applicant is to proceed with the rest of her \ndelinquent debts. Applicant\u2019s present finances and ability to make payment toward old \ndebts is unclear. Her delinquent obligations include a debt to the IRS for over $40,000 \nupon which the IRS states she cannot at presently pay. Applicant failed to describe her \nmethodology or approach for addressing her debts in the past, and no strategy is \nexpressed for resolving her remaining outstanding accounts in the future. This process \ndoes not expect an applicant to satisfy or address all of her obligations; indeed, \nApplicant\u2019s demonstrated progress is commended. What is needed, however, is some \ndescription of a coherent and appropriate plan to address the remaining debts at issue \ngoing forward. Without such a scheme, her likelihood of success cannot be surmised. In \nlight of the foregoing, I find that Applicant failed to mitigate financial considerations \nsecurity concerns. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.d: \n \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.e-1.g: \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs1.h-1.j: \n \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.k-1.l: \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.m:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.n-1.o: \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.p:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n7 \n \n \n \n \n \n        Conclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant a security clearance. \nEligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n \n \n                                             \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nArthur E.

(e-\nQIP)  On April 23, 2018, the Department of Defense (DOD) issued a Statement of \nReasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing security concerns under Guideline F, Financial \nConsiderations and Guideline J, Criminal Conduct. The action was taken under \nExecutive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry \n(February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense \nIndustrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as \namended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) effective for cases after June \n8, 2017.  \n \nApplicant answered the SOR on May 22, 2018, and requested a hearing before \nan administrative judge. The case was assigned to another administrative judge on April \n30, 2019.  The case was reassigned to me on June 18, 2019.  The Defense Office of \nHearings and Appeals issued a notice of hearing on May 6, 2019, and the hearing was \nconvened as scheduled on June 24, 2019. The Government offered nine exhibits, \n\n \n2 \n \nreferred to as Government Exhibits 1 through 9, which were admitted without objection. \nThe Applicant offered fourteen exhibits, referred to as Applicant\u2019s Exhibits A through N, \nwhich were admitted without objection.  Applicant testified on his own behalf. The record \nremained open until close of business on July 1, 2019, to allow the Applicant the \nopportunity to submit additional supporting documentation.  Applicant submitted one \nPost-Hearing Exhibit, referred to as Applicant\u2019s Post-Hearing Exhibit A, which was \nadmitted without objection.  DOHA received the transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on July 8, \n2019. \n \n  \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant is 31 years old.  He is unmarried.  He has a Bachelor\u2019s degree.  He \nholds the position of Custodial Clean Room Attendant with a defense contractor.  He \nseeks to obtain a security clearance in connection with his employment in the defense \nindustry.  He has never held a security clearance before.  \n \nParagraph 1 Guideline F \u2013 Financial Considerations   The Government alleges that the \nApplicant is ineligible for clearance because he is financially overextended and at risk of \nhaving to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.  \n \n \nThe SOR alleges that Applicant is indebted to six separate creditors totaling \napproximately $15,000 in debts, and $12,000 in traffic fines owed to a state for a total of \n$27,000.  In his Answer, Applicant admits each of the allegations set forth in the SOR.  \nCredit reports of the Applicant dated September 22, 2016; December 1, 2018; and \nOctober 11, 2018, reflect that each of these debts were owing at one point.  \n(Government Exhibits 3, 4 and 5.)       \n \n \nApplicant admits that he made many poor decisions, financial and other wise, as \na teenager and young adult.  He hung around the wrong group of people and got \nhimself into a lot of trouble with the law.  In 2009, when he was charged with Burglary, \nhe went to jail for two days and realized that he needed to change his life before it was \ntoo late.  Since then Applicant has been working to improve himself and to show \nresponsibility and good judgment.   \n \n \nApplicant lives with his parents.  He pays rent of $600 monthly to his parents.  He \nalso makes his car payments of $335 each month on time, his cell phone bill of $120 a \nmonth, and pays his insurance on a regular basis.  Applicant explained that his financial \nproblems began when, as a full-time student, he was in a motorcycle accident and had \nthree broken bones.  He was taken to the emergency room with no medical insurance.  \nHe was billed accordingly.  Applicant was unaware that he could have qualified for \nemergency care or Medi-Cal.  As a result of this accident, Applicant fell behind on \nseveral of the debts listed in the SOR.   \n \n \nIn July 2017, Applicant began working for his current employer.  He enjoys his \nwork and is well liked.  He currently bring home between $3,000 and $3,200 a month.  \nSince 2017, he has been working diligently to resolve his delinquent debt.  He borrowed \n\n \n3 \n \nsome money from his mother to resolve his delinquent medical debts and has already \nrepaid her with his refunds from his income tax returns. \n \n \nThe following delinquent debts listed in the SOR became owing and are now paid \noff in full, or are being paid in regular systematic monthly payments. \n \n1.a. Applicant was indebted to a creditor for an account placed for collection in the \napproximate amount of $2,477.  This was for his bail bond.  Applicant has paid the debt \noff in full. (Tr. pp. 38-39 and Applicant\u2019s Exhibit H.)             \n \n1.b.  Applicant was indebted to a creditor for a medical account that was placed for \ncollection in the approximate amount of $90.  This was a medical bill from the \nmotorcycle accident.  Applicant has paid the debt off in full.  (Tr. p. 39 and Applicant\u2019s \nExhibit I.) \n \n1.c.   Applicant was indebted to a creditor for a medical account placed for collection in \nthe approximate amount of $4,771.  This was a medical bill from the motorcycle \naccident.  Applicant has paid the debt off in full.  (Tr. p. 40 and Applicant\u2019s Exhibit J.)          \n \n1.d.  Applicant was indebted to a creditor for a medical account that was placed for \ncollection in the approximate amount of $5,260.  This was a medical bill form the \nmotorcycle accident.  Applicant has paid the debt off in full.  (Tr. p. 40 and Applicant\u2019s \nExhibit K.) \n \n1.e.  Applicant was indebted to a state for traffic fines assessed against him in 2014 for \nan account that was placed for collection in the approximate amount of $1,260.  This \nwas for unpaid traffic tickets and interest.  Applicant has paid the debt off in full.  (Tr. p. \n41 and Applicant\u2019s Exhibit M.)           \n \n1.f.  Applicant was indebted to a state for traffic fines assessed against him in 2017 in \nthe approximate amount of $878.  This was for unpaid traffic tickets and interest.  \nApplicant has paid the debt off in full.  (Tr. p. 41 and Applicant\u2019s Exhibit M.)   \n             \nParagraph 2 Guideline J \u2013 Criminal Conduct   The Government alleges that the \nApplicant is ineligible for clearance because he engaged in criminal activity that creates \ndoubt about a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules and regulations.  \n \n \nApplicant also engaged in a litany of criminal activity over the past fifteen years.  \nHe has no excuses for this misconduct.  He was simply immature and irresponsible.  \n(Government Exhibits 6, 7 and 8.)  \n \n2.a.  In June 2001, Applicant was charged with Drunk in Public.  Applicant denies this \nincident.  He was only in junior high school at the time.  (Tr. pp. 44 - 45.)  This allegation \nis found for the Applicant.   \n \n2.b.  In December 2002, Applicant was charged with Speeding and Driving While on a \nSuspended License.  Applicant denies this incident.  Applicant was not old enough at \n\n \n4 \n \nthis time to possess a driver\u2019s license.  (Tr. p. 45.)  This allegation is found for the \nApplicant.   \n \n2.c.  In about November 2005, Applicant was charged with Driving While on a \nSuspended License.  Applicant denies the incident.  He did not receive a Driver\u2019s \nLicense until he was eighteen years old in 2010.  (Tr. p. 46)  This allegation is found for \nthe Applicant. \n \n2.d.  In about June 2006, Applicant was charged with Possession of Marijuana.  \nApplicant admits the incident.  Applicant admits that he was cruising in a car with some \nfriends when he had marijuana in his possession.  He was pulled over by the police and \ncited.  (Tr. p. 47-48.)    \n \n2.e.  In about June 2009, Applicant was charged with Speeding, Failure to Appear and \nFailure to Pay.  Applicant admits that he was speeding and he did not have the money \nto pay the fines.  (Tr. p. 49.)   \n \n2.f.  In about September 2009, Applicant was charged with Speeding and Possession of \nMarijuana.  Applicant does not remember the specifics but admits that during this time \nin his life he engaged in such conduct.  (Tr. p. 50.)   \n \n2.g.  In about October 2009, Applicant was charged with Burglary, Selling Marijuana, \nand Driving Without a License.  Applicant explained that when he was arrested he had \n$600 in his pocket because he had just been paid at work where he cleaned carpets.  \nHe was arrested for burglary because he and his friends were breaking into cars.  As a \nresult of this offense, Applicant served two days in jail.  (Tr. pp. 51-54.)           \n \n2.h.  In about June 2012, Applicant was charged with Speeding.  Applicant explained \nthat he was driving 90 miles an hour, about 10 miles over the speed limit, when he was \npulled over.  His driver\u2019s license was suspended.  (Tr. p. 55.)   \n \n21.i.  In about September 2012, Applicant was charged with Speeding and Driving on a \nSuspended License.  At the time, Applicant was going to school and working and chose \nto drive on a suspended license.  (Tr. pp. 55-57.)     \n \n2.j.  In about October 2013, Applicant was charged with Driving Without a License.  \nApplicant stated that he lost his license due to the number of speeding violations he \nhad.  He currently has a valid driver\u2019s license.  He has not had a traffic violation of any \nsort for the past five years.  (Tr. pp. 58.)   \n \n2.k.  In about January 2014, Applicant was charged with Driving with a Suspended \nLicense and Driving an Unregistered Vehicle.  Applicant believes that he was initially \npulled over for having dark tint on his front seat windows and cited.  (Tr. pp. 59-60)     \n \n2.l.  In April 2017, Applicant was charged with Failure to Provide a Child Restraint, \nFailure to Appear.  Applicant denies this allegation as he states that this has never \noccurred.  (Tr. p. 60.) \n\n \n5 \n \n \n \nApplicant credibly expressed that since 2014 his life has changed for the better.  \nHe has really grown up and moved forward in a positive direction by adhering to rules \nand regulations and overall being a more responsible individual. \n \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record.  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.  \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \n\n \n6 \n \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern for Financial Considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18, as \nfollows:       \n \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information.  Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence.  An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds.  \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage.  \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. Three are potentially applicable in this case:   \n \n(a) inability to satisfy debts;    \n \n(b)  unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do do; and    \n \n \n(c)  a history of not meeting financial obligations. \n \n \nApplicant has experienced financial hardship due to an unexpected motorcycle \naccident where he needed emergency medical care and had no insurance.  He was \nalso financially irresponsible.  The evidence is sufficient to raise the above disqualifying \nconditions. \n \n \n \nFour Financial Considerations mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially \napplicable:  \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \n\n \n7 \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or \nseparation, clear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity \ntheft), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved  or is under control;  \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n \nSince June 2017, Applicant has been working hard to pay off his delinquent debt.  \nHe has paid off all of the debt listed in the SOR.  Applicant clearly understands the \nresponsibilities that come along with possessing a security clearance.  He has \ndemonstrated financial responsibility by resolving his delinquent indebtedness.  He has \nacted maturely, reasonably and responsibly, and has demonstrated good judgment, \nreliability, and trustworthiness.  The Financial Considerations concern has been \nmitigated.  \n \nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Criminal Conduct is set out in \nAG \u00b6 30: \n \nCriminal activity creates doubt about a person\u2019s judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person\u2019s ability \nor willingness to comply with laws, rules and regulations. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 31 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. The following are potentially applicable:  \n \n(a) a pattern of minor offenses, any one of which on its own would be \nunlikely to affect a national security eligibility decision, but which in \ncombination cast doubt on the individual\u2019s judgment, reliability, or \ntrustworthiness; and \n \n(b) evidence (including, but not limited to , a credible allegation, an \nadmission, and matters of official record) of criminal conduct, regardless of \nwhether the individual was formally charged, prosecuted, or convicted.  \n \nApplicant engaged in a number of criminal activities as a young adult that \nresulted in him being charged, convicted, fined and even sentenced to jail.  The \naforementioned disqualifying conditions have been established.  \n \n\n \n8 \n \nFour Criminal Conduct mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 32 are potentially \napplicable:  \n \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur \nand does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, trustworthiness, or \ngood judgment; \n \n(b) the individual was pressured or coerced into committing the act and \nthose pressures are no longer present in the person\u2019s life; \n \n(c) no reliable evidence to support that the individual committed the \noffense; and  \n \n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including, but not limited \nto, the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, restitution, \ncompliance with the terms of parole or probation, job training or higher \neducation, \ngood \nemployment \nrecord, \nor \nconstructive \ncommunity \ninvolvement. \n \n \nApplicant has been a nuisance for many years.  He simply disregarded many of \nthe laws of our society.  He did whatever he wanted to do at the time without regard for \nthe consequences.  This shows extreme poor judgment.  Until he spent time in jail, he \ndid not absorb the seriousness of his actions.  His experience in jail in 2009, whatever it \nwas, made a dramatic impact on him, and helped him to want to be a better person and \nlive a better life.  Although he continued to violate some traffic laws after that, he did not \nengage in any other criminal activity.  Five years has now passed without a violation of \nthe law in any form or fashion.  Applicant understands that if he is to possess a security \nclearance he must demonstrate that he is a mature individual who consistently follows \nall rules and regulations.  Applicant looks to be a changed man.  At this time, he has \ndemonstrated sufficient evidence of rehabilitation.  AG \u00b6 32(a) and (d) are applicable \nand provide full mitigation.  In the event that Applicant makes poor decisions in the \nfuture and deviates from this positive path, his security clearance will be in immediate \njeopardy. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \n\n \n9 \n \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments \nunder Guidelines F and J in my whole-person analysis.  Overall, the record evidence \nleaves me without questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a \nsecurity clearance. For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant has mitigated the \nFinancial Considerations security concerns.  \n \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a.: through 1.f.:  \nFor Applicant \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline J : \n \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a.: through 1.l  \nFor Applicant \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant national security eligibility \nfor a security clearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \n \n \n \n \nDarlene Lokey Anderson \nAdministrative Judge \n",

The Defense Office of Hearings and \nAppeals (DOHA) assigned the case to another administrative judge on August 3, 2018, \nand reassigned it me on October 3, 2018. DOHA issued a Notice of Hearing on October \n18, 2018, setting the hearing for November 7, 2018. Department Counsel offered \nGovernment Exhibits (GE) 1 through 4 into evidence. All exhibits were admitted without \nobjection. Applicant testified but did not offer any exhibits. DOHA received the hearing \ntranscript (Tr.) on November 16, 2018. The record remained open until December 14, \n2018, to give Applicant an opportunity to provide exhibits. He timely submitted six \n01/23/2019\n\n \n \n \n \n2\ndocuments that I marked as Applicant Exhibits (AE) A through F. Department Counsel \ndid not object to them, and they are admitted into evidence. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted the allegations in \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.e. \nHe denied the allegation in \u00b6 1.f. His admissions are incorporated into these findings. \n \n \nApplicant is 27 years old and recently engaged. After graduating from high school \nin 2009, he enlisted in the U.S. Army. He served on active duty for four years and in the \nArmy Reserve for one year, until 2014, when he was honorably discharged as an E-4. \nWhile serving, he deployed to the Middle East from July 2012 to April 2013. He received \na Purple Heart, a Good Conduct Medal, and an Army Commendation Medal during his \nservice. He was granted a Top Secret security clearance in 2009 after entering the Army. \nAfter leaving the Army, he attended college fulltime from 2013 to 2014. (Tr. 15-18, 21, 23)  \n \n \nAfter college, Applicant worked in private industry. In May 2015, he started his \ncurrent position with a defense contractor. His performance evaluations have been good \nand resulted in merit pay increases. His fianc\u00e9 is aware of this proceeding and the \nunderlying security concerns. (Tr. 18-20) \n \n \nIn April 2015, Applicant submitted a security clearance application (SCA). In it, he \ndisclosed that he had used marijuana and cocaine. (GE 2) During an investigative \ninterview in October 2016, he discussed more fully his illegal drug use. While testifying \nhe stated that he used marijuana less than five times prior to joining the Army in 2009. \nWhile on active duty, he used marijuana once in September 2012 after he was injured \nand lost two friends in combat. (Tr. 21-23; GE 4)  \n \n \nAfter leaving military service, Applicant started working as an electrician for a \nprivate company for about 18 months. Between November 2014 and January 2015, he \nused marijuana about 15 times and then stopped. (Tr. 22) \n \n \nApplicant used cocaine for the first time in May 2012 while he was in Italy and prior \nto deployment. He was with other soldiers at the time. He then used cocaine between five \nand ten times while deployed to the Middle East. He was a machine gunner and ingested \nit to stay awake during long combat missions. He obtained the drugs from a local citizen. \n(Tr. 25-26) \n \n \nWhile in the Middle East, Applicant also purchased and used anabolic steroids for \none month. He has not used any other illegal substances and has no intention to use \nthem in the future. (Tr. 30, 43) \n \n \nApplicant denied that he used cocaine after submitting his April 2015 SCA, \nalthough he stated that he had during his interview. He said that he was confused about \ndates of his usage, but was certain that he did not use illegal substances months before \nstarting his current job in April 2015. (Tr. 29-29) \n\n \n \n \n \n3\n \nApplicant has changed his life since leaving military service. He is engaged and \npurchased a home. He no longer associates with people who use drugs. He spends time \nwith his family and is involved in community outreach programs. He has never tested \npositive for drugs. (Tr. 30-31) \n \n \nApplicant explained that he also used cocaine to help medicate his post-traumatic \nstress disorder (PTSD) that he began suffering during service. After returning to the \nUnited States from his deployment, he saw a therapist once in 2013. In 2014, he started \nattending a group for veterans who have PTSD that met on his college campus. He went \nto the group weekly for two months. He stopped when he left college. In February 2016, \nhe started seeing a psychiatrist who prescribed an antidepressant for PTSD. He took the \nmedication for about eight months and then stopped. In October 2017, he saw his primary \ncare physician who recommended that he resume taking an antidepressant, which he \nhas been doing. He also stays in contact with a person he met at the group therapy \nmeetings for support. (Tr. 32-40)   \n \n \nApplicant submitted two letters of recommendation. Applicant\u2019s former \nCommander for two years wrote that Applicant \u201cwas an exceptional performer . . . a great \nteammate, and served his country honorably.\u201d (AE A) Based on his observation of \nApplicant during combat, he has no reservations about Applicant\u2019s ability to handle \nsensitive information. (AE A) A soldier, who served with Applicant, stated that Applicant \n\u201cwas a charismatic, dependable, and hard worker, even when faced with adverse \ncondition.\u201d (AE B) \n \n \nApplicant provided performance evaluations from 2016 and 2017. They document \nhis successful work, potential, and good attitude. (AE C, D, E, F) \n \nPolicies \n \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG), which were effective \nwithin the DOD on June 8, 2017.  \n \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for national security eligibility, the \nadministrative judge must consider the AG. In addition to brief introductory explanations \nfor each guideline, the AG list potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating \nconditions, which are to be used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility. \n \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in AG \u00b6 2(c) describing the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. The entire \nprocess is a conscientious scrutiny of applicable guidelines in the context of a number of \nvariables known as the whole-person concept. The administrative judge must consider \n\n \n \n \n \n4\nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. I have not drawn inferences based on mere speculation or \nconjecture.  \n \n \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.14 requires the Government to present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 says that an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d  \n \n \nA person applying for national security eligibility seeks to enter into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants national \nsecurity eligibility. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the \napplicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as \nto potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified or sensitive information.  \n \n \nFinally, as emphasized in Section 7 of Executive Order 10865, \u201c[a]ny determination \nunder this order adverse to an applicant shall be a determination in terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also Executive Order 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information.) \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline H: Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \n \nAG \u00b6 24 describes the security concern involving drug involvement and substance \nmisuse as follows: \n \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual's reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior may \nlead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. Controlled substance means any \"controlled substance\" as \n\n \n \n \n \n5\ndefined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term adopted in \nthis guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above. \n \nAG \u00b6 25 sets out conditions that could raise a security concern. Three may be \ndisqualifying in this case: \n \n(a) any substance misuse (see above definition);  \n \n(c) illegal possession of a controlled substance, including cultivation, \nprocessing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of \ndrug paraphernalia; and \n \n(f) any illegal drug use while granted access to classified information or \nholding a sensitive position. \n \nApplicant admitted that he illegally purchased and used marijuana, cocaine, and \nanabolic steroids periodically from October 2007 to January 2015. Some of that time, he \nheld a security clearance. The evidence established the above disqualifying conditions. \n \nConditions that could mitigate drug involvement and substance misuse security \nconcerns are provided in AG \u00b6 26. The following are potentially applicable: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; and \n \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and substance \nmisuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and \nhas established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not limited to: \n \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts;  \n \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; \nand \n \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that any future \ninvolvement or misuse is grounds for revocation of national security \neligibility. \n \n \nThe last time Applicant used an illegal substance, marijuana, was in January 2015, \nprior to submitting his April 2015 SCA. He used marijuana once while he was deployed \nto a combat zone after being injured and losing friends. He also used cocaine and \nanabolic steroids during the deployment from 2012 to 2013. He used cocaine to stay \nawake while on missions. His last usage occurred over three years ago and does not cast \n\n \n \n \n \n6\ndoubt on his current trustworthiness. The evidence establishes mitigation under AG \u00b6 \n26(a).  \n \nApplicant acknowledged his past drug involvement and substance misuse. In early \n2016, he received treatment and medication for PTSD, an underlying cause of his drug \nuse. Since October 2017, he has been under the care of his primary care physician for \nhis medical issues and has continued to take appropriate medication, as prescribed. He \nno longer associates with people who use illegal drugs and has changed his priorities. He \nemphasized that he has no intention to use illegal drugs in the future, but he did not sign \na statement confirming his intention. The evidence establishes partial mitigation under \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 26(b)(1) and (2), but not under AG \u00b6 26(b)(3). \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s national security eligibility by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct \nand all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nAccording to AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant national security \neligibility must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the applicable guidelines and the whole-person concept.  \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \npertinent facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guideline H in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 \n2(d) were addressed under that guideline, but some warrant additional comment. \n \nAfter observing Applicant\u2019s demeanor and listening to his testimony, I found him \ncandid and honest. He disclosed his illegal drug use in his 2015 SCA. While not \ncondoning his previous drug abuse, he explained that a significant portion of it occurred \nwhile deployed to a combat zone. He is now engaged and purchased a house. He is \naddressing his PTSD. He understands the ramifications that future drug misuse could \nhave on his employment. Given these factors, letters of recommendation from two \nindividuals with whom he served, and the fact that he voluntarily stopped using all illegal \ndrugs in January 2015, I do not believe that he will engage in similar conduct in the future. \n\n \n \n \n \n7\nOverall, the record no longer raises doubt as to Applicant\u2019s present eligibility and \nsuitability for a security clearance.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline H:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \n     Subparagraphs 1.a through 1.f: \n     For Applicant \n \n \n      \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly \nconsistent with the interests of national security to continue Applicant\u2019s access to \nclassified information.

He earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in 1973, and a master\u2019s degree in 1978. He married in 1973 and adopted two children, now adults, from his wife\u2019s previous marriage. They also have an adult child from their union. One of his adult children has special needs. Applicant served in the U.S. Army for 22 years in the Air Defense Artillery, including multiple overseas deployments. He retired in 1996 at the rank of lieutenant colonel.

His criminal conduct casts doubt on his \nreliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. National security eligibility for access to \nclassified information is denied.  \n \n \n \n \n \n Statement of the Case \n \n \nOn April 20, 2015, Applicant submitted a security clearance application (SCA). \nOn August 20, 2018, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications Facility \n(DOD CAF) issued Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR), detailing security \nconcerns under Guidelines J and E. The action was taken under Executive Order (EO) \n10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as \namended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance \nReview Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the Adjudicative \nGuidelines (AG) effective within the DOD on June 8, 2017.    \n \n \n \nApplicant answered the SOR on August 29, 2018. He admitted SOR \u00b6 1.a, but \nhe failed to admit or deny SOR \u00b6 2.a, which was a cross-reference to SOR \u00b6 1.a. I have \n\n \n2 \n \n \ninterpreted this omission as a denial by Applicant. He requested a hearing before an \nadministrative judge. On December 31, 2018, the Defense Office of Hearings and \nAppeals (DOHA) issued a notice of hearing, setting the hearing for January 16, 2019. \nOn January 4, 2019, the case was assigned to me. \n \n \nDuring the hearing, Department Counsel offered Government Exhibit (GE) 1-7, \nwhich I admitted into evidence without objection. Applicant offered Applicant Exhibit \n(AE) A-J, which I entered into evidence without objection. (Tr. 26-32) Applicant testified, \nand I held the record open until February 16, 2019, in the event either party wanted to \nsubmit additional documentation. On February 3, 2019, Applicant provided two \nadditional documents. I admitted AE K and L into evidence without objection. DOHA \nreceived the hearing transcript (Tr.) on January 25, 2019, and the record was closed on \nFebruary 16, 2019.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nHaving thoroughly considered the evidence in the record, I make the following \nfindings of fact:  Applicant is 68 years old. He earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in 1973, and \na master\u2019s degree in 1978. He married in 1973 and adopted two children, now adults, \nfrom his wife\u2019s previous marriage. They also have an adult child from their union. One of \nhis adult children has special needs. Applicant served in the U.S. Army for 22 years in \nthe Air Defense Artillery, including multiple overseas deployments. He retired in 1996 at \nthe rank of lieutenant colonel. Immediately after his retirement, he was employed by a \nDOD contractor. He has worked for this DOD contractor for nearly 23 years. He \ncurrently possesses a DOD security clearance. Applicant has received several \ncertificates, letters of appreciation, and favorable employee evaluations during the \ncourse of his employment. (Tr. 21-25; GE 1; AE H, AE I, AE J) \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.a alleges that in February 2014, Applicant was arrested and charged \nwith four counts of felony theft for stealing luggage from the local airport between \nNovember 2013 and February 2014. Applicant admitted this allegation in his response \nto the SOR. During the hearing, Applicant admitted his arrest but denied stealing any \nbags. He mistakenly took a bag in the local airport on the day of his arrest, but it was \nnever his intent to steal it. He claimed the other three pieces of stolen luggage he was \ncharged with did not involve him. (Tr. 26) \n \nIn December 2015, Applicant participated in a background interview with an \nauthorized DOD investigator. When questioned about his February 4, 2014 arrest, \nApplicant stated that he flew into the local airport of State A for a work assignment. He \ntook his two checked bags from the luggage carousel and left the airport. He soon \nrealized he forgot to retrieve a carry-on bag that he was unable to fit in the overhead \ncompartment when he boarded the airplane. He stated this bag had been checked with \nthe airplane\u2019s cargo. He did not receive a claim tag for this bag. Applicant called the \nairline to see if his bag was at the airport. The airline had difficulties tracking his bag \nsince he did not check it in at the airline counter and the bag was never tagged with a \nclaim tag. (Emphasis added) A couple days later the airline called him to report several \n\n \n3 \n \n \nunclaimed bags had arrived and requested Applicant to come to the airport to see if one \nof the bags belonged to him. (Tr. 48; GE 2)  \n \nDuring the background interview, Applicant told the investigator that he arrived at \nthe airport at approximately 6:00 p.m. He came in from the outside door near the \nluggage area and found what he thought was his bag and walked away. He was \nstopped by the police and questioned about the bag in his possession. He told the \nofficer it was his bag, but after further examination, it was determined to be another \nindividual\u2019s bag. He is legally blind in his right eye and believed this contributed to him \npicking up the wrong bag. He was taken by the police to a holding room for questioning. \nApplicant had flown into this airport on countless occasions for his employer. Police \nreviewed security tapes and matched him with three other earlier incidents where \nluggage had been stolen from the airport. In addition, police noted that on each of these \noccasions, the suspected thief had come from the outside door to the luggage area with \na luggage cart instead of coming directly from the flight arrival gate. The police obtained \na search warrant of his hotel room, but they did not find any incriminating evidence. \nDespite the search warrant result and Applicant\u2019s explanations, the police charged him \nwith four felony counts of theft. (GE 2) \n \nApplicant hired a local attorney. He did not want to plead guilty to the charges as \nhe was \u201cin no way involved in the theft of luggage.\u201d His attorney advised him that if he \ndid go to trial, Applicant would have to pay him an additional $10,0001 in legal fees, and \nhe also indicated the case could drag out for two years or longer. The state\u2019s attorney \noffered a plea bargain. The agreement included conditions that Applicant pay the airline \nrestitution in the approximate amount of $3,000, and perform 24 hours of community \nservice. After he fulfilled the terms of the agreement, the court would place the charges \non the Stet docket. If Applicant did not accept the plea bargain, the DA would proceed \nwith the criminal trial. Since Applicant claimed this was the most cost-effective and \nexpedient way to handle the situation, he accepted the plea bargain and fulfilled the \nspecified conditions. (Tr. 38, 58; GE 2) \n \nThe police records showed the airline reported a suitcase was stolen on \nNovember 17, 2013. The detective reviewed video footage of the luggage area which \nshowed a white male removing the bag and leaving the terminal. Another theft occurred \non November 19, 2013. The same white male was witnessed on the video footage, \nabout 50 years old, wearing dark colored shoes, light jeans, and a dark colored waist \nlength jacket, taking a blue suitcase that was reported as stolen. The surveillance \nfootage showed that on both occasions, the male suspect did not walk to the baggage \nclaim from the airline gate. Instead, the male suspect entered the baggage claim area \nfrom the outside door with a luggage cart to retrieve the suitcases. The police placed a \nbulletin of the male suspect\u2019s photo for the airline employees to call police if he was \nseen in the baggage area. There were no thefts of luggage reported from November 21, \n2013 through February 1, 2014. (GE 5) \n \n                                                          \n1 Applicant later said he had paid $7,000 for his attorney, and if he went to trial, he would have to pay an \nadditional $13,000-$15,000. (Tr. 58) \n\n \n4 \n \n \nOn approximately February 2, 2014, an airline representative notified a police \ndetective that a bag was stolen from the baggage carousel. The surveillance video \nshowed the same male suspect that was posted on the November 2013 bulletin. On this \ndate, he was wearing a dark blue peacoat and blue jeans. On February 4, 2014, an \nairline employee called a police detective to report that the male suspect from the \nbulletin was back at the baggage area, wearing a blue coat and blue jeans. At \napproximately 2:00 p.m., the detective located the male suspect in the hourly garage, \nwith a luggage cart that had a black Samsonite roller suitcase, without a claim tag. The \nmale suspect told the detective that he flew in yesterday and had returned to the airport \nto claim his lost bag. (Tr. 52; GE 5) \n \nWhile the detective was talking with Applicant, a phone call came in that a \npassenger could not locate his black roller suitcase, and he told the airline his name \ncard was located on the outside of the bag. The detective inspected the roller suitcase \nthat was on Applicant\u2019s luggage cart which showed the victim\u2019s name card on the \noutside of the bag. The police found the victim\u2019s airline claim tag in a trash can inside \nthe hourly garage. Applicant was apprehended by the police for questioning. After \nreviewing Applicant\u2019s travel itinerary, the police discovered Applicant had been in State \nA during the two incidents of luggage theft in November 2014, and the earlier incident of \nluggage theft on February 2, 2014. Applicant was charged with four felony counts of \ntheft. (Tr. 52; GE 5)  \n \nAt the hearing, Applicant was asked about the circumstances which led to his \narrest. On February 2, 2014, Applicant carried his bag, filled with books, when he \nboarded the airplane. It would not fit in the overhead compartment, and the airline \nattendant checked his bag without placing an airline claim tag on it. When he exited the \nairplane, Applicant assumed his bag would be in the aisle, but it was not there. He \nasked the flight attendant about the checked bag, and he was informed that his bag \nwould be located at the baggage claim. He also explained that he never carries his bags \nfor two reasons: (1) he has a bad back, and on the day of his arrest, (2) his lost carry-on \nbag was filled with books, so it was heavy.2 Applicant found his two checked suitcases, \nbut his carry-on bag was not there. He reported his bag missing to the airline and \nprovided his phone number. Since his bag had not been tagged, the airline could not \ntrack it. He was told that his bag may arrive on a later flight, and they would give him a \ncall. On the day of his arrest, he claimed he received a call from the airline letting him \nknow his bag may be there, but they did not know for certain since his bag was not \ntagged. (Emphasis added) (Tr. 26-30, 32, 35) \n \n  \nApplicant believed he was identified on the video footage near the baggage claim \non dates he did not fly on the airline, which also included some of the dates the \nsuitcases were stolen, because he had visited the USO in the airport to acquire free \ndrinks, snacks, and he enjoyed talking with families. He did not provide any USO sign-in \nsheets to corroborate his claim. On the day of his arrest, Applicant admitted he had \n                                                          \n2 Although Applicant carried his heavy bag filled with books when he boarded the airplane on February 2, \n2014. \n \n\n \n5 \n \n \nremoved the airline tag from the suitcase. Applicant described himself as being a little \nobsessive.  Whenever he retrieves his suitcase, he immediately rips off all of the tags \nand throws them away. This always has been his consistent habit when traveling. \nApplicant did not provide any witness statements to corroborate his claim. (Tr. 39-41, \n53, 60-61) \n \nApplicant\u2019s salary with his current employer is approximately $260,000. He was \nasked why, with his significant income, he would not pay the additional money to his \nattorney to fight the felony theft charges that were filed against him. Applicant claimed \nthat his income in 2014 was significantly lower, about $140,000 to $150,000. (Emphasis \nadded) When questioned about this substantial difference in salary from the same \nemployer, Applicant said it was due to him not receiving bonuses in 2014. He then \nstated that his decision to accept the plea bargain was not fully financially based. He \nalso consulted with his lawyer, family, and after management\u2019s assertion that his \nacceptance of the plea bargain would not hurt him in any way, he took the deal. I \nrequested Applicant provide a copy of his filed 2014 tax return while the record was held \nopen for 30 days. The requested 2014 tax return was provided on February 3, 2019. It \nshowed, in part, that Applicant\u2019s annual income was $233,424, plus taking into account \nhis annual pensions and annuities of $52,817, he had a combined total income of \n$287,466 for 2014. (Emphasis added) (Tr. 63-66; AE K, AE L) \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the AG. In addition to brief introductory explanations \nfor each guideline, the AG list potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating \nconditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified \ninformation. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \n\n \n6 \n \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 an \u201capplicant is responsible \nfor presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate \nfacts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the ultimate \nburden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\u201d  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk that an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline J; Criminal Conduct \n \n \nThe security concern for criminal conduct is set out in AG \u00b6 30: \n \nCriminal activity creates doubt about a person\u2019s judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person\u2019s ability \nor willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations.  \n \n \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. I have \nconsidered all of the disqualifying conditions under AG \u00b6 31, and the following is \npotentially applicable: \n \n(b) evidence (including, but not limited to, a credible allegation, an \nadmission, and matters of official record) of criminal conduct, regardless of \nwhether the individual was formally charged, prosecuted, or convicted. \n \n \nIn February 2014, Appellant was arrested on four felony counts of theft. He \naccepted a plea bargain and paid approximately $3,000 restitution to the airline, and \nperformed 24 hours of community service. The court placed the charges on the Stet \ndocket. The charges were not dismissed for lack of evidence. If Applicant had not \nfulfilled the conditions of the plea bargain, the DA made it clear they would continue with \nprosecution of the case against him. The above disqualifying condition applies. \n \n\n \n7 \n \n \n \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns \narising from criminal conduct. The following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 32 are \npotentially applicable: \n \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur \nand does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or \ngood judgment;  \n \n(c) no reliable evidence to support that the individual committed the \noffense; and \n \n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including, but not limited \nto, the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, restitution, \ncompliance with the terms of parole or probation, job training or higher \neducation, \ngood \nemployment \nrecord, \nor \nconstructive \ncommunity \ninvolvement. \n \n \nAppellant\u2019s charges of felony theft were based on two thefts of luggage in late \nNovember 2013 and two thefts in February 2014. After the two thefts in November, the \npolice made a bulletin with the male suspect\u2019s picture taken from the surveillance \nfootage. The police asked the airline employees to call police if the suspect was seen in \nthe airport. A diligent airline employee saw the male suspect from the bulletin photo and \nimmediately called the police. The suspect spotted near the baggage claim area turned \nout to be Applicant. He had entered from the outside door with a luggage cart to retrieve \na bag, just as the suspect did in the three earlier thefts. While returning to his car, \nApplicant removed the tags from the suitcase and threw them into the trash can. \nApplicant claimed it was a fluke that he was in possession of another individual\u2019s bag at \nthe time the detective stopped to question him. \n \n \nApplicant did not provide truthful information when he was questioned about his \n2014 income. He claimed he made approximately $145,000 due to him not receiving \nemployment bonuses that year. A copy of his 2014 tax return showed that his income \nwas almost double the amount he reported. It is important to note, however, that \nApplicant consistently reported that his lost carry-on bag did not have an airline tracking \ntag on it. The day he arrived at the airport to look for his lost bag, Applicant took a \nsuitcase that had an airline tracking tag on it. The tag should have put him on notice that \nthis was not his bag, or at the very least, he should have taken a closer examination of \nthe bag since a name card was located on the outside of the suitcase. Applicant did not \nwork with an airline representative to claim his lost carry-on bag.  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s travel itinerary showed he was in the area when the three earlier \nthefts occurred. The video footage also showed him in the airport on days he was not \ntraveling on an airplane. Applicant claimed he would go to the airport\u2019s USO for free \ndrinks and snacks. When Applicant was stopped by the detective after an airline \nemployee recognized the suspect from the bulletin, Applicant just happened to be in \n\n \n8 \n \n \npossession of a suitcase that was reported missing. I find this an unlikely coincidence. \nApplicant\u2019s explanations are not credible or corroborated. His criminal conduct casts \ndoubt on his reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. His failure to accept \nresponsibility or express any remorse for his misconduct demonstrates that he has not \nbeen successfully rehabilitated. The above mitigating conditions do not apply. \n  \nGuideline E: Personal Conduct \n \n \nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the security concern for personal conduct:  \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \nprovide truthful and candid answers during national security investigative \nor adjudicative processes. \u2026 \n \n \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and be \ndisqualifying. The following is potentially applicable under the established facts in \nthis case: \n \n(e) personal conduct, or concealment of information about one\u2019s \nconduct, that creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or \nduress by a foreign intelligence entity or other individual or group. \nSuch conduct includes: \n \n(1) engaging in activities which, if known, could affect the \nperson\u2019s personal, professional, or community standing. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s criminal conduct was addressed under that specific guideline. The \nsame issue was cross-alleged under the personal conduct guideline. No specific \npersonal conduct allegations were raised beyond what was raised under the appropriate \nguideline. I have previously addressed the issue under Guideline J.  \n \n \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns \narising from personal conduct. The following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 17 are \npotentially applicable: \n \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or the behavior is so infrequent, or it happened under such \nunique circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual's reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n (d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained \ncounseling to change the behavior or taken other positive steps to \nalleviate the stressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to \n\n \n9 \n \n \nuntrustworthy, unreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such \nbehavior is unlikely to recur; and \n \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate \nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress. \n \n \nApplicant has consistently denied that he stole suitcases from an airport when he \nwas on travel for his employer. Having determined that his explanations were not \ncredible or corroborated, the evidence supports he engaged in criminal conduct, and his \npersonal conduct casts doubt on his reliability, trustworthiness, and overall good \njudgment. None of the mitigating conditions apply. \n  \n \n \n \n \n  Whole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the \npotentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and \ncircumstances surrounding this case. This SOR highlights serious offenses that provide \ninsight to a person\u2019s character and integrity. Applicant has not accepted responsibility \nfor his misconduct, nor has he expressed any remorse for his deceit. I conclude that \nApplicant has not mitigated security concerns raised by his criminal conduct and \npersonal conduct. Accordingly, Applicant has not carried his burden of showing that it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to continue his eligibility for access to \nclassified information. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n10 \n \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline J:  \n \n      AGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \n       \nAgainst Applicant \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \n \n      AGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \n \n       \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national security to grant Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security \nclearance.

He did not disclose \nrequired financial information in his security clearance application. He failed to mitigate \nthe resulting financial and personal conduct security concerns. National security eligibility \nfor access to classified information is denied. \nStatement of the Case \nOn January 22, 2018, the Department of Defense (DOD) issued to Applicant a \nStatement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security concerns under Guideline F (Financial \nConsiderations) and Guideline E (Personal Conduct). The action was taken under \nExecutive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, \n1960), as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security \nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the National \nSecurity Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified \n03/11/2019\n\n \n \n \n \n2\nInformation or Eligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position (AG) effective within the DOD on \nJune 8, 2017.  \n \n \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on May 1, 2018, and requested that his \ncase be decided by an administrative judge on the written record without a hearing \n(Answer). On June 21, 2018, Department Counsel submitted the Government\u2019s written \ncase. A complete copy of the File of Relevant Material (FORM), containing eight Items, \nwas mailed to Applicant and received by him on July 8, 2018. The FORM notified \nApplicant that he had an opportunity to file objections and submit material in refutation, \nextenuation, or mitigation within 30 days of receipt of the FORM. Applicant did not submit \nany additional information, refutation, or objections to the Government\u2019s evidence. Items \n1 through 8 are admitted into evidence. DOHA assigned the case to me on February 14, \n2019. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant admitted the four financial allegations contained in the SOR. He denied \nthe personal conduct allegation. He provided some explanations. (Item 2) \n \n \nApplicant is 44 years old, married, and has three children, ages 22, 19, and 1 . He \nearned a bachelor\u2019s degree in 1996. In July 2016, he began a position with a defense \ncontractor and works overseas. Prior to this position, he owned a martial arts business \nfor many years and periodically worked for other companies. (Item 3) \n \n \nIn February 2016, Applicant submitted a security clearance application (SCA). \nUnder Section 26: Financial Record, which inquired into his financial history, he did not \ndisclose any financial delinquencies, tax liens, or automobile repossessions. (Item 3) \nDuring an October 2017 background interview with a government investigator, he was \nconfronted with information about two tax liens, an automobile repossession, and a 2008 \nbankruptcy. Applicant stated that he failed to list the 2014 tax lien due to an oversight. He \ntold the investigator he did not intend to mislead the Government about the information. \nHe said his wife, a lawyer, manages their finances, implying that he is not involved in \nthem. He said he was not required to disclose the 2008 bankruptcy because it was outside \nthe time limit of the question. Although the automobile repossession account was not \ncharged off until May 2016, which was after he submitted his SCA, the related delinquent \nloan payments and resulting deficiency debt occurred earlier. He did not disclose the \nrepossession or the underlying debt on his SCA, or assert that it first arose after February \n2016. He acknowledged to the investigator that he did not disclose this repossession. In \nhis Answer, he said he did disclose it because he did not know that he owed any money \non the automobile after the car was returned. (Items 1, 2, 8)  \n \n \nBased on credit bureau reports (CBRs) from December 2017 and May 2016, public \nrecords, Applicant\u2019s 2008 bankruptcy documents, and his admissions, the SOR alleged \nfour financial security concerns. The status of each allegation is as follows: \n \n\n \n \n \n \n3\n \n(SOR \u00b6 1.a) In 2013, Applicant entered into a car lease. Toward the end of 2015 \nhe stopped making payments on the lease and it was repossessed. This $8,716 \nautomobile repossession debt was charged off in May 2016. Applicant stated he was \ntrying to negotiate a settlement. (Items 2, 4, 8) It is unresolved. \n \n \n(SOR \u00b6 1.b) In 2014, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) filed a $29,236 income \ntax lien against Applicant for unpaid taxes related to a business he owned.1 He said his \nwife secured payment of this debt with the IRS through a home equity loan. It will be paid \nby the future sale of the house, unless he and his wife pay it sooner. He did not explain \nor justify his failure to timely pay the taxes involved, or submit any documentation from \nthe IRS corroborating the status of this debt or the settlement agreement. (Item 2) It is \nunresolved. \n \n \n(SOR \u00b6 1.c) In November 2017, Applicant\u2019s home state filed an income tax lien \nagainst him for $3,629. Applicant said his wife negotiated the same settlement noted \nabove with the state taxing agency. He did not submit documentation from the state \ncorroborating his assertion, or explain why he failed to pay the taxes when due. (Items 2, \n6) It is unresolved. \n \n \n(SOR \u00b6 1.d) In March 2008, Applicant and his wife filed a Chapter 7 bankruptcy. \nThe bankruptcy petition listed outstanding income taxes owed to the IRS for years 2004, \n2005, and 2006, and state income taxes owed for those years. It also listed outstanding \nstudent loans. The total liability owed for unpaid state and Federal taxes, and student \nloans was listed as $194,206. Their unsecured nonpriority claims totaled $127,857, and \nincluded numerous medical debts, personal loans, credit cards, and professional fees. \nTheir personal and real assets totaled $577,031; and their liabilities totaled $893,643. The \nbankruptcy was discharged in June 2008. The final amount of debt discharged is unclear, \nbut delinquent tax and student loan debts are not usually eligible. (Item 7) \n \n \nThe SOR alleged in \u00b6 2.a that Applicant deliberately falsified information in his SCA \nbecause he failed to disclose the charged-off automobile repossession debt and the \nunpaid Federal tax lien filed in 2014. As noted above, Applicant said the 2014 tax \nomission was an oversight and not intentional. He said he did not report this repossession \nbecause he was unaware that he owed money on the lease.  \n \n \nIn his Answer, Applicant said his finances are more stable now and he continues \nto pay down his remaining debts. He said the monthly family income now exceeds their \nmonthly expenses. He stated that 10 years ago, he experienced financial difficulties \nbecause of the real estate market downturn and he was a sole business owner, raising \nthree young children. (Item 2) \n \n \n \n                                            \n1 The tax years are not in the record; however, Applicant listed his self-employment from 2010 to 2015 in \nhis SCA. (Item 3) \n\n \n \n \n \n4\nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for national security eligibility, the \nadministrative judge must consider the AG. In addition to brief introductory explanations \nfor each guideline, the AG list potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions, which \nare useful in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known \nas the whole-person concept. The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere \nspeculation or conjecture. \n \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.14 requires the Government to present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 states that an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as \nto potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information.  \n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that an adverse decision shall be \u201cin \nterms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of \nthe applicant concerned.\u201d See also Executive Order 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple \nprerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information.) \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n5\nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concerns relating to the guideline for financial considerations are set \nout in AG & 18:  \n \nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect classified information. Financial distress can also be caused by or \nexacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other issues of \npersonnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental health \nconditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal acts to generate funds.  \n \nAG \u00b6 19 sets out disqualifying conditions that could potentially raise security \nconcerns. Four are potentially applicable in this case:  \n \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; \n \n(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so; \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \n \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired. \n \nApplicant has a long history of not meeting financial obligations, as confirmed by \na 2008 Chapter 7 bankruptcy in which he included a significant amount of debt. Since the \ndischarge of debt in 2008, he has continued to accumulate more debt as documented by \nsubsequent outstanding Federal and state income taxes and an automobile \nrepossession. The evidence is sufficient to raise the above disqualifying conditions. \n \nAfter the Government produced substantial evidence of the disqualifying \nconditions, the burden shifted to Applicant to produce evidence and prove mitigation of \nthe security concerns. AG \u00b6 20 sets out five conditions that could potentially mitigate \nfinancial security concerns in this case: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n\n \n \n \n \n6\n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority \nto file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \n \nApplicant has a history of financial problems that is ongoing and casts doubt on \nhis reliability and good judgement. His indebtedness is unresolved. There is insufficient \nevidence to establish mitigation under AG \u00b6 20(a). Applicant did not provide a credible \nexplanation for failing to pay outstanding taxes or resolve the repossession debt. While \nhis wife may manage their finances, he remains responsible for the alleged SOR debts. \nHe failed to establish mitigation under AG \u00b6 20(b), as there is insufficient proof that the \nSOR-alleged debts arose from circumstances beyond his control or that he acted \nresponsibly in addressing them. In fact, the evidence is to the contrary, as the IRS and \nstate filed liens in order to obtain payments. There is no evidence that Applicant received \ncredit counseling, or that his finances are under control. He did not submit evidence that \nhe initiated a good-faith effort to resolve the automobile repossession or document that \nhe has settlement arrangements with the IRS and state revenue agency. He did not \nestablish mitigation under AG \u00b6\u00b6 20 (c), (d), or (g).  \n \nGuideline E: Personal Conduct \n \nAG \u00b6 15 explains the security concerns relating to personal conduct: \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes.  \n \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. One may be potentially disqualifying: \n \n\n \n \n \n \n7\n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or \nsimilar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment \nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine national security \neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities. \n \nThe evidence established insecurity concerns under AG \u00b6 16(a). Applicant failed \nto disclose required financial information. He provided no persuasive explanation or \nevidence for his failure to disclose the 2014 Federal tax lien and the vehicle loan \ndelinquency/repossession, in his February 2016 SCA. Considering his past financial \nproblems and the large amount of debt he accumulated since the 2008 bankruptcy, it is \nnot credible that he failed to disclose any derogatory information due to oversight or \nbecause he did not think he was required to report the repossession, on the basis he did \nnot know he owed money on the broken lease. \n \nAG \u00b6 17 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. Five are \npotentially applicable: \n \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; \n \n(b) the refusal or failure to cooperate, omission, or concealment was caused \nor significantly contributed to by advice of legal counsel or of a person with \nprofessional responsibilities for advising or instructing the individual \nspecifically concerning security processes. Upon being made aware of the \nrequirement to cooperate or provide the information, the individual \ncooperated fully and truthfully; \n \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, \nunreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to \nrecur; and \n \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate vulnerability \nto exploitation, manipulation, or duress. \n \nApplicant did not provide evidence that would support mitigation under any of the \nforegoing conditions.  \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n8\nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which \nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and \nother permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) \nthe potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \n AG \u00b6 2(c) requires the ultimate determination of whether to grant national security \neligibility include an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of \nthe guidelines and the whole-person concept. \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline F and Guideline E in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 \n2(d) were addressed under those guidelines, but some warrant additional comment. \n \nApplicant is a 44-year-old man who has worked for a defense contractor since July \n2016. According to a 2008 Chapter 7 bankruptcy petition, his financial delinquencies date \nback to 2004, when he did not timely pay Federal and state income taxes. In 2008, he \ndischarged a large amount of debt. Nonetheless, his financial delinquencies continued \naccumulating into 2017, when his home state filed a tax lien. He has not established a \ntrack record of responsibly managing his finances, given his long history of non-\ncompliance with fundamental legal obligations to pay taxes and resolve other debts. The \nrecord evidence leaves me with serious doubts about Applicant\u2019s judgment, reliability, \nand suitability for a security clearance. Applicant failed to mitigate the security concerns \narising under the Financial Considerations and Personal Conduct guidelines.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \n  \n   AGAINST APPLICANT \n \n          Subparagraphs 1.a through 1.d: \n   \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n             Paragraph 2, Guideline E: \n \n \n      AGAINST APPLICANT \n\n \n \n \n \n9\n \n \n \n Subparagraph 2.a:  \n \n \n \n   Against Applicant \n \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant a security clearance. \nNational security eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n \n_________________ \nSHARI DAM \nAdministrative Judge \n",

Henderson, Esq., Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Jeremiah J. Sullivan III, Esq., Law Offices  \n \n \nMarch 13, 2019 \n______________ \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \n \nLokey Anderson, Darlene D., Administrative Judge: \n \nOn January 7, 2017, Applicant submitted a security clearance application (e-\nQIP). On February 12, 2018, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications \nFacility (DoD CAF) issued Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR), detailing security \nunder Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry \n(February 20, 1960), as amended; DoD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel \nSecurity Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive).   \n \nApplicant answered the SOR on March 7, 2018, and requested a hearing before \nan administrative judge. The case was assigned to me on May 2, 2018.  The Defense \nOffice of Hearings and Appeals issued a notice of hearing on November 30, 2018, and \nthe hearing was convened as scheduled on December 6, 2018. The Government \noffered four exhibits, referred to as Government Exhibits 1 through 4, which were \nadmitted without objection. The Applicant offered nine exhibits at the hearing, referred \nto as Applicant\u2019s Exhibits A through I, which were admitted without objection.  Applicant \ntestified on his own behalf. The record remained open until close of business on \nDecember 20, 2018, to allow the Applicant the opportunity to submit additional \nsupporting documentation.  Applicant submitted one Post-Hearing Exhibit, referred to as \n\n \n2 \n \nApplicant\u2019s Post-Hearing Exhibit A, which was admitted without objection.  DOHA \nreceived the transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on December 17, 2018. \n \n \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant is 68 years old. He is married with two children.  He has a Master\u2019s \ndegree in computer resource management.  He is employed with a defense contractor \nas a Lear Jet Pilot.  Applicant started working for his current employer in December \n2016, and is now reapplying for a security clearance in connection with his employment. \n \nGuideline F - Financial Considerations \n \n \n \nThe Government alleged that Applicant is ineligible for a clearance because he \nmade financial decisions that indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which raise questions about his \nreliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified information.  \n \nAfter completing his Bachelor\u2019s degree, Applicant was commissioned in the U.S. \nNavy in 1973.  Following a twenty year stellar Navy career, where Applicant served \nhonorably as a pilot, he retired in 1993.  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit G.)  Throughout his military \ncareer, he held a security clearance without incident.  He then went back to school to \nobtain his Master\u2019s degree.   \n \nIn March 1995, Applicant went to work with Federal Express where he worked as \na flight engineer for four years, and then a co-pilot and pilot for sixteen years.  His job \nrequired him to have a security clearance and a Special Background Investigation, as \nhe carried weapons in the cockpit, and every six months had to requalify with the \nweapon.  Every two years he had to go through two days of hand to hand combat \nfighting in the cockpit in close quarters.  (Tr. p. 27.)  After retiring from Federal Express \nin 2015, Applicant has not had a clearance.  Applicant had no history of financial \nproblems during his Navy career or while working for Federal Express.  Applicant\u2019s \nfinancial problems began when he hired an attorney to assist him in obtaining two loan \nmodifications.       \n \n \n \nThe SOR identified two delinquent mortgage accounts on two separate homes \ntotaling in excess of one million dollars.  Applicant admits both allegations under this \nguideline.  Credit Reports of Applicant dated April 6, 2017; and February 1, 2018, \nconfirm the indebtedness listed in the SOR.  (Government Exhibits 3 and 4.)   \n \nApplicant explained that he had two houses, a primary residence in California, \nand a summer house in Montana.  Since both homes had variable interest rate loans, \nhis plan was to refinance the loans to get fixed rates once he retired from Federal \nExpress.  It about June 2015 Applicant received a letter from an attorney in a Real \nEstate Law Firm soliciting business, indicating that he could assist the Applicant in \nobtaining a mortgage refinance.  The cost to represent the Applicant with both \nproperties was $5,000 up front, and $1,500 monthly until the matters were concluded.  \n\n \n3 \n \nApplicant hired the attorney, paid the initial fee of $5,000, and then paid the $1,500 fee \nfor twenty months, before learning that he had been swindled.  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit A.)  \nThis was in December 2016, when Applicant learned that his primary residence was \nbeing foreclosed upon.  While Applicant thought that the attorney was working with the \nbank to get his mortgages refinanced, Applicant\u2019s Montana home was foreclosed upon \nand his primary residence in the process of being foreclosed upon and the attorney he \nhad hired was being disbarred for malpractice.  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit B, C, D and E.)  \nDuring the twenty months that Applicant was making payments to the attorney of $1,500 \nmonthly, Applicant continued to make his mortgage payments until the attorney told him \nto get at least two payments behind.  Eventually, Applicant stopped making the \npayments when the bank no longer accepted the payments because the house was in \nforeclosure.  It turns out that for some of 2916 and about all of 2017, Applicant did not \nmake his mortgage payments on his primary residence.  His attorney prepared and filed \na lawsuit on behalf of the Applicant against the bank for predatory lending.  When the \nattorney was disbarred, another law firm from Seattle took over the affairs from \nApplicant\u2019s attorney\u2019s real estate law firm.  The lawsuit was dismissed by the court in \nNovember 2018. \n \nSometime in 2018, Applicant hired a new attorney who recommended filing for \nChapter 13 bankruptcy to stop the Applicant\u2019s primary residence from being foreclosed \nupon.  Applicant testified that his current attorney is still trying to get his primary \nresidence refinanced with the bank.  However, since February 2018, Applicant has been \nmaking his mortgage payments of $2,901 each month to the bank.  In June 2018, he \nfiled for Chapter 13 bankruptcy and is following the monthly payment plan set up by the \nbankruptcy trustee in the amount of $4,440.  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit F, and Post Hearing \nExhibit A.)       \n \nThe following debts were alleged on the SOR:  \n \n1(a) A delinquent mortgage account owed to a bank with a total balance of \n$314,555.00 was past due in the amount of $71,432 and in foreclosure status.  \nApplicant explained that this was the debt owed on the Montana summer home.  It was \nforeclosed upon in February 2018 and sold in April 2018.  The house sold for $238,000 \nfor the property.  Applicant believes he owed $248,000 on the loan at the time of the \nsale.  (Tr. p. 51 - 52.)  Applicant states that the sale of the house settled the amount he \nowed on the loan.  Applicant\u2019s Post-Hearing Exhibit A, indicates that there is no \noutstanding debt, as deficiency judgments are not allowed in Montana.       \n \n1(b) A delinquent mortgage account owed to a bank with a total balance of \n$724,222.00 was past due in the amount of $103,122.00.  Applicant\u2019s new attorney is \ncurrently in negotiations with the bank to obtain a loan modification.  As mentioned \nabove, Applicant has filed a Chapter 13 bankruptcy to stop the foreclosure on his \nprimary residence.  Applicant is under the five year plan with the court, requiring him to \npay $4,440 monthly that goes toward his bills and mortgage arrearage.  Applicant \ntestified that after taxes, with his retirement as well as his current salary, he brings \nhome about $159,000 annually.  He stated that he can comfortably continue to make \nthese payments without difficulty.  Applicant\u2019s Post-Hearing Exhibit A provides copies of \n\n \n4 \n \nchecks paid to the bankruptcy trustee each month from July 2018 through November \n2018 in the amount of $4,440. \n \n \nApplicant has received a number of awards and accolades during his career with \nthe Navy, his employment with Federal Express, and his current employer.  (Applicant\u2019s \nExhibits G, H, and I.)   \n \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious \nscrutiny of a number of variables known as the whole-person concept. The \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record.  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d  \n \n \nA person who applies for access to classified information seeks to enter into a \nfiduciary relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n \n\n \n5 \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \n \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG \u00b6 18: \n \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. Three are potentially applicable in this case:   \n \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; \n \n(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so; and \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \n \n  \nApplicant became delinquently indebted when he hired the wrong attorney to \nhelp him obtain loan modifications for his properties.  Instead of being helpful, the \nattorney led him down the wrong path.  The evidence is sufficient to raise the above \ndisqualifying conditions.  \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. I considered \nall of the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 including: \n \n(a)  the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \n\n \n6 \n \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \n(b)  the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control; \n \n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \notherwise resolve debts; and \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \n \nCircumstances beyond Applicant\u2019s control started his financial problems.    \nApplicant was a victim of a crooked attorney, who squandered Applicant\u2019s money, and \ndid not properly represent his best interests.  As a result, the attorney was disbarred.  \nApplicant lost his summer home, and is currently involved in a Chapter 13 bankruptcy \nfor the next four years in order to keep his primary residence.  There is nothing else in \nthe record that leads one to believe that Applicant is not forthcoming or that he has \nbeen unreasonable and irresponsible.  In fact, from Applicant\u2019s experience, it can be \ngleaned that he clearly understands the responsibilities required in holding a security \nclearance.  He knows that he must live within his means at all times, and pay his bills in \na timely manner.  So far, he has acted reasonably and responsibly with respect to his \ndebts.  Much of his situation was not his fault, but can be attributed to the fact that he \ntrusted his attorney.  Accordingly, it is found that his debts are now under control.  \nFurthermore, Applicant has demonstrated that future financial problems are unlikely.  \nThere are clear indications that his financial problems are being resolved.  \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \n\n \n7 \n \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept.  \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline F in my whole-person analysis.  Applicant honorably served our country on \nactive duty for twenty years and held a security clearance without incident.  Following \nthat he worked for Federal Express for another twenty years, held a security clearance \nand again had no problems.  Since obtaining a more competent attorney, following his \nadvice, Applicant has been making his mortgage payments, and following the \nbankruptcy trustee\u2019s payment plan according to the Chapter 13.  Applicant has shown \ngood judgment and reliability and demonstrated that he is financially responsible.          \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions and doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant has mitigated the Financial Considerations security concerns.  \n \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.b:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant national security eligibility \nfor a security clearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \n \n \n \n \nDarlene Lokey Anderson \nAdministrative Judge \n",

Between 2012 and \n2016, Applicant accumulated delinquent debt. Although she has resolved some of her \ndelinquent debt, she still owes over $30,000 in delinquent accounts, which mostly \nconsists of outstanding federal and state income taxes. Applicant has failed to \ndemonstrate that her finances are under control. Clearance is denied.  \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nOn January 26, 2018, the DOD issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing \nsecurity concerns under the financial considerations guideline. This action was taken \nunder Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry, \nsigned by President Eisenhower on February 20, 1960, as amended; as well as DOD \nDirective 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program, \ndated January 2, 1992, as amended (Directive), and the Adjudicative Guidelines for \nDetermining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information, implemented on June 8, \n2017.   \n \nDOD adjudicators were unable to find that it is clearly consistent with the national \ninterest to grant Applicant\u2019s security clearance and recommended that the case be \nsubmitted to a Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) administrative judge for \n\n \n2 \n \na determination whether to revoke her security clearance. Applicant timely answered \nthe SOR and requested a hearing. (Hearing Exhibit (HE) 1). At the hearing, convened \non February 27, 2019, I admitted Government\u2019s Exhibits (GE) 1 through 9, without \nobjection. (Tr. 15, 17). Applicant did not offer any documents. The record remained \nopen until April 19, 2019. Applicant timely submitted  Applicant Exhibit (AE) A, which is \nadmitted without objection. (HE 2). DOHA received the transcript (Tr.) on March 11, \n2019.  \n \nOn June 20, 2019, Applicant contacted Department Counsel to provide updated \ninformation about her employment. Although Department Counsel did not object to \nreopening the record for the consideration of new information, neither party presented \ngood cause for doing so. Accordingly, this decision is based on the record as it stands.  \n(HE III.) \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant, 46, has worked as a project manager for federal contracting \ncompanies since 1999. She has been in her current position since May 2018. Applicant \nhas previously held public trust eligibility and a security clearance issued by other \nfederal agencies. She completed her most recent security clearance application in \nSeptember 2014, disclosing four delinquent accounts and one account she was \ndisputing with a creditor. The ensuing investigation revealed additional delinquent \naccounts. The SOR alleges that Applicant owes $97,705 in delinquent debt, including \n$3,496 and $31,841 in outstanding state and federal income taxes, respectively. (GE 1 \n\u2013 7; Tr. 23-24). \n  \n \nApplicant blames her financial problems on a series of events between 2012 and \n2018. First, she experienced three periods of unemployment, totaling seven months. \nSecond, Applicant was involved in a serious motorcycle accident in March 2015 that \nresulted in months of recovery during which she collected disability income at a fraction \nof her pay. In March 2016, she lost her job earning $184,000. When she returned to \nwork in May 2016, she did so earning $120,000. Although, her income has increased \nover the years, she has not been able to secure a position at the pay she earned in \n2016. In addition, Applicant serves as the financial pillar of her family. She is often \ncalled upon to help family members with unexpected expenses, as was the case in \n2015, when she paid the burial and related expenses for two family members. Divorced \nin 2002, Applicant raised her two children, now adults, on her own without the benefit of \nchild support. She continues to provide financial support to one of her children and her \nparents, totaling $1,500 each month. (GE 1; Tr. 25-28, 30-32, 57-58, 60). \n \nIn her March 2018 answer to the SOR, Applicant provided documentation that  in \nFebruary 2018, she resolved the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d \u2013 1.i, and 1.l \u2013 1.m, \ntotaling $3,350. She also established that she rehabilitated her mortgage (SOR \u00b6 1.a, \n$21,175), to current status, explaining that she refinanced the loan and added the past-\ndue amount to the principal balance of the loan. However, at the hearing, Applicant \nadmitted that she was one month behind on the refinanced mortgage loan.  Applicant \nalso credibility testified that she was unable to find the creditor alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.n \n\n \n3 \n \n($322). The delinquent debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b \u2013 1.c, 1.j \u2013 1.k, and 1.o, totaling \nalmost $73,000, remain unresolved. (Answer; Tr. 17-22, 34-37, 40-42, 44-46). \n \nApplicant incurred the largest debt, SOR \u00b6 1.b for $27,401, when she was \nmedically evacuated by helicopter under emergent circumstances to a hospital after her \nMarch 2015 motorcycle accident. Her insurance carrier declined to cover the related \ncharges because the helicopter transport service, which Applicant did not choose, was \nout of network. Applicant claims that she has been making $150 payments each month \nsince November 2018. She did not provide any corroborating evidence of these \npayments. The debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.d is the deficiency balance on an automobile \nloan Applicant co-signed for her son. Applicant claims that the outstanding balance is \n$6,000, not $10,000 as alleged. She did not provide documentation to corroborate this \ninformation. (Tr. 37-40).  \n \nThe SOR debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.j, 1.k, and 1.o are related to outstanding \nstate and federal income taxes. Applicant blames her tax problems on the actions of the \ntax preparer she used at the time. In 2012, Applicant started her own business. She did \nnot understand the tax requirements of being self-employed. Relying on her tax \npreparer\u2019s advice, Applicant did not pay income taxes as she earned income, resulting \nin a $31,842 federal income tax obligation that she could not afford to pay. (Tr. 68-69). \n \n Applicant testified that she began mailing payments toward the 2012 federal tax \ndebt in November 2017 and that the  IRS entered into an installment agreement with \nher in February 2018. She agreed to pay $300 per month. In October 2018, the IRS \ncancelled the agreement for nonpayment. Applicant explained that she made her \nmonthly payments as required, but sent them to the wrong address. The IRS returned \nthe payments to her. After the hearing, Applicant negotiated a new installment \nagreement with the IRS, in which she agrees to pay $315 for 71 months to resolve her \ntax liability. According to documentation provided by Applicant\u2019s state tax authority, she \nowes $2,449 in unpaid state taxes. In December 2017, she established a monthly \npayment plan of $115. She did not provide a history of payments for her outstanding tax \nliabilities or documentation confirming the new installment agreement with the IRS. \n(Answer; AE A; Tr. 43, 48-50, 67).  \n \nThe record shows that Applicant failed to file her 2012 through 2014 federal \nincome tax returns on time. According to the tax transcripts, she did not file for \nextensions. The 2012 and 2013 returns were filed in August 2014. She filed her 2014 \nfederal income tax return in May 2015. In December 2017, Applicant received a letter \nfrom the IRS indicating that no returns were filed for the 2015 and 2016 tax years. It is \nunclear from the record when the returns were filed, but she did not owe any additional \ntax liabilities for either year. At hearing, Applicant testified that she had yet to file her \nfederal and state income tax returns for 2017. She filed the outstanding state and \nfederal income tax returns when she filed her 2018 returns in April 2019. She received \nrefunds for both years, which will be applied to her outstanding tax balances. (Answer; \nGE 2; AE A; Tr. 42-44, 47). \n \n\n \n4 \n \n \nApplicant currently earns $150,000. She also does occasional odd jobs to earn \nadditional money. In 2017, she sought financial counseling and made life style changes \nto reduce her delinquent debt. (Tr. 32-33, 63-65). \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record.  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.  \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \n\n \n5 \n \nAnalysis \n \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nFailure to meet one\u2019s financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of \njudgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified \nor sensitive information. (AG \u00b6 18). The SOR alleges that Applicant owes $97,705 in \ndelinquent debt including $31,841 federal income taxes and $3,496 in state income \ntaxes. The record is sufficient to establish the Government\u2019s prima facie case that \nApplicant has a history of not meeting her financial obligations and that she failed to \ntimely file and pay her state and federal income tax returns, as required. (AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(c) \nand (f)).   \n \nThe record contains some evidence in mitigation. Applicant has resolved the \naccounts alleged in SOR  \u00b6\u00b6 1.d \u2013 1.i, and 1.l \u2013 1.m and provided a legitimate basis for \ndisputing the debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.n. (AG \u00b6\u00b6 16(d) and (e)). Although the debt \nalleged in SOR \u00b6 1.b is large and remains unpaid, any potential security concerns are \nresolved in Applicant\u2019s favor because the debt is for emergency medical care that \nApplicant had no choice in selecting. She incurred this debt as the result of an \ninsurance carrier\u2019s decision to deny her claim. However, the favorable evidence in the \nrecord is not enough to mitigate the concerns raised by Applicant\u2019s financial history.  \n \nDespite Applicant\u2019s testimony on the efforts she has taken to rehabilitate her \nfinances, she failed to demonstrate that her finances are under control. She did not \nestablish that her mortgage is current. The automobile loan deficiency balance alleged \nin SOR \u00b6 1.c ($10,120) remains unresolved and Applicant did not present a plan for \nrepayment. Applicant\u2019s unresolved federal and state income tax liabilities, totaling over \n$33,000, are of greater concern. She did not provide sufficient documentation to show \nthat she has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority or that she has \ncomplied with the agreements she testified are in place. Furthermore, Applicant has \nfailed to timely file her income tax returns for six of the last seven years. \n \nBased on the record, doubts remain about Applicant\u2019s suitability for access to \nclassified information. In reaching this conclusion, I have also considered the whole-\nperson factors at AG \u00b6 2(d). After the Government presents evidence raising security \nconcerns, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut or mitigate those concerns. (See \nDirective \u00b6E3.1.15). An applicant is reasonably expected to provide corroborating \ndocumentation regarding her financial interests. Failure to produce corroborating \ninformation is relevant in deciding whether or not an applicant\u2019s claims should be \naccepted. Applicant\u2019s claims about the status of her outstanding tax liabilities and \nobligations are not supported by the record. She failed to meet her burden of production \nand persuasion to refute or mitigate the financial considerations allegations.  \n \n \n \n \n\n \n6 \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Financial Considerations:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a, 1.c., 1.j. \u2013 1.k., 1.o:  \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.b, 1.d. \u2013 1.i., 1.l \u2013 1.n:  \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented, it is not clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant Applicant a security clearance.

The action was taken under Executive Order (Exec.\nOr.)10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as\namended; DoD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance\nReview Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); Security Executive Agent,\nby Directive 4, National Security Adjudicative Guidelines (SEAD 4). \n12/31/2018\n\nApplicant responded to the SOR on April 4, 2018, and requested a hearing. The\ncase was assigned to me on May 24, 2018. The Government\u2019s case consisted of three\nexhibits that were admitted without objection (GEs 1-3). Applicant relied on one witness\n(himself) and three exhibits that were admitted without objection (AEs A-C). The\ntranscript of the proceedings (Tr.) was received on August 2, 2018.\nProcedural Issues\nBefore the close of the hearing, Applicant requested the record be kept open to\npermit him the opportunity to supplement the record with documentation of early\ntermination of his non-supervised probation and expungement. For good cause shown,\nApplicant was granted 60 days to supplement the record. Department Counsel was\nafforded seven days to respond. \nWithin the time permitted, Applicant supplemented the record with the following\ndocumentation: summary of charges and disposition of a March 2016 DUI charge,\ncharacter references, a DoD award recognizing Applicant\u2019s meritorious service as part\nof a DoD response to a 2015 cyber-security incident, and a minute order approving\nearly termination of Applicant\u2019s probation. Applicant\u2019s submission\u2019s were  admitted\nwithout objection as AEs D-G.\nSummary of Pleadings\n \nUnder Guideline  G, Applicant allegedly committed four alcohol-related offenses\nbetween March 1991 and March 2016. Specific allegations are as follows: (a) March\n1991 DUI charges with conviction of alcohol-related reckless driving; (b) October 1996\nDUI charges followed by conviction of the offense and sentencing of 30 days to home\nconfinement and placement on probation for three years; (c) April 1997 DUI charge\nfollowed by conviction of the offense and due to a previous probation violation,\nsentencing of 270 days of confinement and placement on probation for five years; and\n(d) March 2016 DUI charge followed by conviction of alcohol-related reckless driving\nand placement on probation until 2019. Alcohol-related allegations covered by\nGuideline G were incorporated under Guideline J.\nIn his response to the SOR, Applicant admitted each of the alcohol-related\nallegations with explanations. He claimed lapses in judgment that he deeply regrets. He\nfurther claimed he enrolled in an alcohol management program to help reinforce what\nhe knows to be the correct decision-making when addressing alcohol issues completed\nalcohol counseling, and provide him with additional tools for avoiding alcohol-related\nincidents in the future. \nFindings of Fact\n Applicant is a 48-year-old chief technologist for a defense contractor who seeks\na security clearance. The allegations covered in the SOR and admitted by Applicant are\nadopted as relevant and material findings. Additional findings follow.\n2\n\nBackground\n                               \nApplicant married in October 2003 and has three children from this marriage.\n(GEs 1-2; Tr. 43) He attended a local community college between June 2008 and June\n2010, but did not earn a diploma. Between June 2010 and May 2012, he attended an\naccredited four-year university and earned a bachelor\u2019s degree. (GEs 1-2) Applicant\nreported no military service. (GEs 1-2; Tr. 50) \nSince March 2016, Applicant has been employed by his current defense\ncontractor. (GEs 1-2; Tr. 21, 47) Between March 1993 and March 2016 he was\nemployed as a division director for a DoD agency. Applicant has held a security clearance\nsince approximately 1995. (GE 1; Tr. 49)\nAlcohol-history\nApplicant presents with a lengthy record of alcohol-related offenses dating to\n1991. In March 1991, he was cited for DUI and later pled guilty to a reduced charge of\nalcohol-related reckless driving. (GEs 1-3) He had attended a local party with 50 to 60\npeople in attendance and consumed three to four beers. (GEs 2-3) Not convinced he\nwas intoxicated he headed home. On his way home, he was pulled over by police for\nspeeding. After acknowledging he had been drinking, the investigating officer at the\nscene administered a sobriety test to Applicant. Police thereafter escorted Applicant to\na county sheriff\u2019s office where Applicant was booked and fingerprinted before being\nreleased. In court, Applicant pled guilty to an alcohol-related reckless driving charge\nand was fined. (GEs 2-3)\nIn October 1996, Applicant was cited for DUI after being stopped and\nadministered a field sobriety test. Appearing in court, Applicant pleaded guilty to DUI.\n(GEs 2-3) He was fined $1,250 and sentenced to 31 days in jail. Records confirm that\nhe accepted an option from the court to serve 30 days of home confinement with an\nankle bracelet with three years of probation. Based on his probation violation, the\nsentencing court placed Applicant on three years of probation. Applicant is credited with\nsuccessfully completing his court-ordered home confinement. (GE 2) \nAppellant was cited for a third DUI offense in May 1997. (GEs 2-3) Returning\nhome from a party where he consumed alcohol with friends and family members, he\nstopped to rest.  When approached by an inquiring police officer, he acknowledged he\nhad been drinking and was escorted by the officer to a local police station where he\nwas booked,  fingerprinted, and released.  Applicant later pleaded guilty to DUI and was\ngiven the option by the court of serving 270 days of home confinement, and was placed\non probation. \nAppellant accepted the home confinement option offered by the sentencing\njudge in connection with Applicant\u2019s 1997 alcohol-related incident and took concerted\nsteps to change his drinking habits during the confinement period. (Tr. 24, 32-41)\nAdditionally, Applicant was required to complete an alcohol education program to retain \nhis drivers license, and was placed on probation by the sentencing court. (Tr. 23-24)\n3\n\nIn March 2016, Applicant was cited for DUI after being stopped by police. (GEs\n2-3) Applicant assured he did not exceed .08 BAC levels with his pre-arrest drinking.\nHis assurances are not challenged and are accepted. In court, Applicant pleaded no\ncontest to the DUI charges and was convicted of alcohol-related reckless driving. (GEs\n2-3 and AE G) He was fined $1,683, required to complete an alcohol education\nprogram, and placed on probation until 2019. (GEs 2-3; Tr. 23) \nUpon Applicant\u2019s September 2018 motion for early termination of probation,\nApplicant\u2019s motion was granted, and Applicant\u2019s probation was terminated, effective\nSeptember 18, 2018. (AE G) While his registered BAC level was only .07 percent, and\nunder the legal limit for driving with reported alcohol in his system, Applicant\nacknowledged his registered .07 BAC level was enough to support an alcohol-related\nreckless driving charge under his state\u2019s driving restrictions. (Tr. 31-34, 45-46) \nFollowing his 2016 alcohol-related reckless driving conviction, Applicant self-\nreferred himself to an outpatient alcohol counseling program. (AEs A-C) His recovery\nprogram consisted of 36 counseling sessions over a four-month period, along with\nrequired participation in meetings of Alcoholics Anonymous (AA). (AE C) Applicant was\ncredited with successfully completing the program in June 2018. (AE A)\nBetween March 2016 and January 2018, Applicant continued to consume\nalcohol on an occasional basis (never to intoxication) without any further alcohol-related\nincidents. (Tr. 45-46) Since January 2018, he has ceased drinking altogether. (Tr. 45-\n46, 52) \nEndorsements and awards\nApplicant is highly regarded by his chief executive officer (CEO) and former\ncolleagues. (AE E) His CEO, who has known him for many years, attested to\nApplicant\u2019s strength of character and compassion for others. He credited Applicant\u2019s\nefforts in training wounded warriors and people with disabilities to integrate into\ncommon working environments. (AE E) He described Applicant as a cherished friend\nand all around great person who is thoughtful, reliable, and open in his professional and\nfamily relationships.\nA senior operating executive with Applicant\u2019s current defense contractor\nemployer who has known Applicant for a number of years credited Applicant with\ndeveloping a working pipeline of training and job placement of person\u2019s with disabilities\non to information technology service contracts with the DoD. (AE E) He praised\nApplicant for his enthusiasm in promoting his firm\u2019s organizational mission and culture\nof taking care of people. (AE E)   \nApplicant has been hailed as a featured speaker for federal law enforcement\nagencies. (AE E) A former colleague and current chief technology officer for Applicant\u2019s\nformer DoD agency who has known Applicant for many years extolled Applicant\u2019s\ntechnical contributions to upgrading his agency\u2019s security systems. (AE E) This current\nDoD agency head credited Applicant with having a limitless talent for finding solutions \n4\n\nand expressed his personal honor in having the opportunity to work with Applicant. (AE\nE) \nAmong Applicant\u2019s many awards is a bestowed award for excellence in 2016\nfrom a DoD under secretary of defense in recognition of Applicant\u2019s exceptional support\nof a DOD cyber-security project. (AE F) This award credited Applicant with exceptional\nmeritorious service in leading his DoD agency\u2019s contract action to provide identity\nprotection and restoration services in connection with a noted adverse cyber-security\nincident. (AE F)\nPolicies\nThe AGs list guidelines to be used administrative judges in the decision-making\nprocess covering DOHA cases. These guidelines take into account factors that could\ncreate a potential conflict of interest for the individual applicant, as well as\nconsiderations that could affect the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to\nprotect classified information. These guidelines include conditions that could raise a\nsecurity concern and may be disqualifying\u201d (disqualifying conditions), if any, and many\nof the conditions that could mitigate security concerns.\u201d  \nThe AGs must be considered before deciding whether or not a security\nclearance should be granted, continued, or denied. The guidelines do not require\nadministrative judges to place exclusive reliance on the enumerated disqualifying and\nmitigating conditions in the guidelines in arriving at a decision. Each of the guidelines is\nto be evaluated in the context of the whole person in accordance with AG \u00b6 2(c). \nIn addition to the relevant AGs, administrative judges must take into account the\npertinent considerations for assessing extenuation and mitigation set forth in AG \u00b6 2(d)\nof the AGs, which are intended to assist the judges in reaching a fair and impartial\ncommonsense decision based upon a careful consideration of the pertinent guidelines\nwithin the context of the whole person. The adjudicative process is designed to examine\na sufficient period of an applicant\u2019s life to enable predictive judgments to be made\nabout whether the applicant is an acceptable security risk. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s conduct, the relevant guidelines are to be\nconsidered together with the following AG \u00b6 2(d) factors: (1) the nature, extent, and\nseriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include\nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which\nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other\npermanent behavioral chances; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for\npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or\nrecurrence.\nViewing the issues raised and evidence as a whole, the following individual\nguidelines are pertinent in this case:\n5\n\n              Alcohol consumption \nThe Concern: Excessive alcohol consumption often leads to the\nexercise of questionable judgment or the failure to control impulses, and\ncan raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness.\nCriminal Conduct\nThe Concern: criminal activity creates doubt about a person\u2019s\njudgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into\nquestion a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, and\nregulations.\nBurden of Proof\nBy virtue of the principles and policies framed by the AGs, a decision to grant\nor continue an applicant's security clearance may be made only upon a threshold\nfinding that to do so is clearly consistent with the national interest.  Because the\nDirective requires administrative judges to make a commonsense appraisal of the\nevidence accumulated in the record, the ultimate determination of an applicant's\neligibility for a security clearance depends, in large part, on the relevance and\nmateriality of that evidence. See United States, v. Gaudin, 515 U.S. 506, 509-511\n(1995).  As with all adversarial proceedings, the judge may draw only those inferences\nwhich have a reasonable and logical basis from the evidence of record. \nThe Government's initial burden is twofold: (1) it must prove by substantial\nevidence any controverted facts alleged in the SOR, and (2) it must demonstrate that\nthe facts proven have a material bearing to the applicant's eligibility to obtain or\nmaintain a security clearance. The required materiality showing, however, does not\nrequire the Government to affirmatively demonstrate that the applicant has actually\nmishandled or abused classified information before it can deny or revoke a security\nclearance. Rather, the judge must consider and weigh the cognizable risks that an\napplicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information.\nOnce the Government meets its initial burden of proof of establishing admitted\nor controverted facts, the evidentiary burden shifts to the applicant for the purpose of\nestablishing his or her security worthiness through evidence of refutation, extenuation,\nor mitigation.  Based on the requirement of  Exec. Or. 10865 that all security\nclearances be clearly consistent with the national interest, the applicant has the\nultimate burden of demonstrating his or her clearance eligibility. \u201c[S]ecurity-clearance\ndeterminations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d See Department of the\nNavy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988). \nAnalysis  \nApplicant comes to these proceedings with a considerable history of alcohol-\nrelated incidents over a 25-year period dating to 1991. Between March 1991 and\nMarch 2016, he pled guilty to four alcohol-related offenses. Principal security issues\n6\n\nraised in this case center on Applicant\u2019s alcohol-related offenses covered by\nGuideline G and incorporated under Guideline J.\nAlcohol consumption concerns\nApplicant\u2019s problems with recurrent alcohol-related incidents over a 25-year\nperiod raise concerns over his risk of future alcohol abuse. On the strength of the\nevidence presented, two disqualifying conditions (DCs) of the AGs for alcohol\nconsumption (AG \u00b6 21) may be applied: DC \u00b6\u00b6 22(a), \u201calcohol-related incidents away\nfrom work, such as driving while under the influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse,\ndisturbing the peace or other incidents of concern, regardless of the frequency of the\nindividual\u2019s alcohol use or whether the individual has been diagnosed with alcohol\nabuse disorder,\u201d and 22(c), \u201chabitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point of\nimpaired judgment, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed with alcohol use\ndisorder.\u201d\nApplicant\u2019s completion of a self-referred alcohol counseling program in June\n2018 followed his last alcohol-related conviction in March 2016 based on a separate\nprovision in his state\u2019s vehicle code for drivers who do not meet the legal requirements\nfor driving over the established .08 BAC limits, but otherwise qualify for driving while\nintoxicated. Still, Applicant felt enough concern about his slip in March 2016 to self-refer\nhimself to a an outpatient counseling program. After reducing his drinking to occasional\ndrinking following his March 2016 incident, he ceased drinking altogether in January\n2018 and has remained abstinent to date. \nBased on the findings of the court considering his March 2016 incident and his\nproactive efforts since his March 2016 offense, he may take full advantage of the\nfollowing Guideline G mitigating conditions: MC \u00b6\u00b6 23(a), \u201cso much time has passed, or\nthe behavior was so infrequent, or it happened under such unusual circumstances that\nit is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability,\ntrustworthiness, or judgment,\u201d and 32(d) \u201cthe individual has successfully completed a\ntreatment program along with required aftercare, and has demonstrated a clear and\nestablished pattern of modified consumption or abstinence in accordance with\ntreatment recommendations.\u201d Applicant\u2019s circumstances and subsequent actions\nfollowing his last alcohol-related incident are sufficient to facilitate safe predictions that\nhe will avoid any abusive drinking in the foreseeable future.\nCriminal conduct concerns\nSecurity concerns are also raised with respect to Applicant\u2019s alcohol-related\nincidents under the overlapping coverage of Guideline J. Disqualifying conditions\napplicable to Applicant\u2019s alcohol-related offenses under Guideline J (criminal conduct)\nare twofold: DC \u00b6\u00b6 31(a), \u201ca pattern of minor offenses, any one of which on its own\nwould be unlikely to affect a national security eligibility decision, but which in\ncombination cast doubt on the individual\u2019s judgment, reliability, or trustworthiness,\u201d and\n31(b), \u201cevidence (including, but not limited to, a credible allegation, an admission, and\nmatters of official record) of criminal conduct, regardless of whether the individual was\n7\n\nformally charged, prosecuted, or convicted.\u201d Each of these cited offenses are cross-\nreferenced under Guideline G and are considered to be alcohol-related for purposes of\nGuideline J analysis.  \nApplicable mitigating conditions covering Applicant\u2019s alcohol-related offenses\nunder Guideline J are as follows:  MC \u00b6\u00b6 32(a), \u201c\u201dso much time has elapsed since the\ncriminal behavior happened, or it happened under such unusual circumstances, that it\nis unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability,\ntrustworthiness, or good judgment,\u201d and 32(d), \u201cthere is evidence of successful\nrehabilitation; including, but not limited to, the passage of time without recurrence of\ncriminal activity, restitution, compliance with the terms of parole or probation, job\ntraining or higher education, good employment record, or constructive community\ninvolvement.\u201d  Passage of time since Applicant\u2019s last alcohol-related offense in March\n2016 exceeds two years and provides enough time to mitigate these alcohol-related\noffenses under Guideline J as well.\nWhole-person assessment\nApplicant\u2019s lengthy civilian service with DoD (23 years) is respected and\nappreciated. Endorsements from his current employer and previous DoD agency\ndocument Applicant\u2019s strong character, trust, and reliability. His credits include letters of\nappreciation of his service as a speaker for a federal law enforcement agency and a\nDoD undersecretary recognizing his contributions to the DoD\u2019s cyber-security\nrestoration efforts. \nApplicant\u2019s recognized service contributions and letters of appreciation when\nconsidered in conjunction with the positive steps he has taken to mitigate security\nconcerns associated with his lengthy history of alcohol-related offenses are is enough\nto dispel concerns about risks of recurrent abusive drinking. Considering the record as\na whole, safe predictions can be made at this time about Applicant\u2019s ability to avoid\nalcohol-related incidents in the foreseeable future. Alcohol concerns are fully mitigated \nand enable favorable conclusions to be made in connection with the allegations\ncovered by Guidelines G and J.\n                                               Formal Findings\nIn reviewing the allegations of the SOR and ensuing conclusions reached in the\ncontext of the findings of fact, conclusions, conditions, and the factors listed above, I\nmake the following formal findings:\nGUIDELINE G (ALCOHOL CONSUMPTION):   FOR APPLICANT\n   \nSubparagraphs 1.a through 1.d:\n          For Applicant\nGUIDELINE J (CRIMINAL CONDUCT):            FOR APPLICANT\n   \nSubparagraph 2.a :                                For Applicant\n8\n\nConclusions\nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s security clearance. \nClearance is granted. \n                                          \nRoger C.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Having thoroughly considered the evidence in the record, including Applicant's admissions, I make the following findings of fact: Applicant is 38 years old. He married in January 2006, and he has one daughter, age 10. He claimed to be nine credit hours short of a bachelor\u2019s degree. Applicant was previously employed with a DOD contractor from May 2006 until December 2015, and he held a DOD security clearance during that period. He was unemployed from about December 2015 to March 2017, when he obtained his real estate license. Applicant was hired by another DOD contractor approximately one year ago. His employer is requesting Applicant obtain a DOD security clearance in order to perform specific employment duties on DOD classified projects. (Tr. 10, 17-21, 23, 35, GE 1) The SOR \u00b6 1.a alleges that Applicant was arrested in about December 2015, and charged with pornography-possession of obscene materials depicting minors, a felony. In his response to the SOR, Applicant admitted he was arrested, but denied that the arrest had any merit to support it. The judge set his bond at $250,000. Applicant stayed in jail for approximately three weeks since he was unable to make bail, but he was later released after his father paid $21,000. Applicant and his family had just moved to state A five weeks earlier after he accepted a new job assignment from his former DOD contractor employer.

(Tr. 10, 17-21, 23, 35, \nGE 1)  \n \nThe SOR \u00b6 1.a alleges that Applicant was arrested in about December 2015, and \ncharged with pornography-possession of obscene materials depicting minors, a felony. \nIn his response to the SOR, Applicant admitted he was arrested, but denied that the arrest \nhad any merit to support it. The judge set his bond at $250,000. Applicant stayed in jail \nfor approximately three weeks since he was unable to make bail, but he was later \nreleased after his father paid $21,000. Applicant and his family had just moved to state A \nfive weeks earlier after he accepted a new job assignment from his former DOD contractor \nemployer. (Tr. 25, 28, 30, 41-42, 48, 50, 63-65; GE 2) \n \nApplicant admitted to looking at pornography on his computer for about the last 25 \nyears, including the five weeks he had lived in state A. His frequency of viewing \npornography varied, but he admitted to looking at it twice weekly in 2015. He denied ever \nintentionally looking for images of minors, or accidently looking at images of minors, \nduring the entire time period he accessed pornography on the internet. It became a habit \nfor him to view pornography, and he continued over the years because he believed that \nviewing pornography was not hurting anyone. (Tr. 25, 28-29, 30, 41-42, 48, 50, 63-65; \nGE 2)   \n \n\n \n3 \n \n \nApplicant stated at the hearing that on the day of his arrest, the police arrived early \nin the morning to his house with a search warrant. A police officer asked him if he knew \nwhy the police were in his home, and Applicant responded \u201cNo.\u201d The police officer told \nhim they were there looking for illegal pornography. The police confiscated his home \ncomputer, and other items, and placed Applicant under arrest. (Tr. 25-26)  \n \nApplicant\u2019s background interview occurred in April 2016, which was subsequently \nadopted by him on March 13, 2018, after he made several changes to the record. In the \ninterrogatories, Applicant listed, \u201cWhen they (police) first arrived, I did not know why they \nwere there. A couple of minutes later, they told me they were there because of the \nobscene material.\u201d He also wrote, \u201cThe charge related to pornography of teens under the \nage of 17 being on my computer, which would have been there from either downloading \nor viewing them on the internet. . . .  When the police came to my house, I admitted I had \npornography on my computer. . . .\u201d He told the investigator that his attorney informed him \nthat the criminal charges filed against him were for child pornography. The district attorney \n(DA) cancelled a meeting with his attorneys, and due to the cancellation, his attorneys \nwere unable to review any incriminating evidence the state had against him. Instead, the \nDA offered to dismiss the charges through a pretrial intervention program with specific \nconditions. The conditions included that he attend weekly meetings for a two-year period \nwith the state\u2019s sex offender group treatment program, and he pay approximately $1,250 \nin court costs. Applicant accepted the DA\u2019s offer and the charges against him were \ndismissed in February 2016. Applicant said that he neither admits, nor denies, his \ninvolvement which led to the criminal charges filed against him. (GE 2)  \n \nAt the hearing, Applicant specifically denied ever looking at child pornography. He \nwas surprised about the criminal charges that were filed against him. He stated that the \ncourt dismissed his \u201ccase almost immediately.\u201d He only accepted the DA\u2019s offer because \nhe wanted to get this ordeal over with as quickly as possible, and he did not have the \nfinancial resources to fight the charges. This incident has taught him a valuable lesson, \nas he has not looked at any pornography for the past three years. The arrest has been a \nsource of embarrassment for him and his wife. (Tr. 28, 30-33, 39-40) \n \nAfter further questioning, Applicant admitted that the DA was not proposing to his \nattorneys that they would be \u201cdismissing the charges outright\u201d against him due to lack of \nevidence. He also agreed that if he had not met the conditions of the pre-trial intervention \nprogram, the DA could have refiled the criminal charges against him. He finished his \nsexual offender treatment program in a year-and-a-half, about six months early. He \ndenied receiving a diagnosis from the treatment program, or that he was required by the \nstate to register as a sex offender. (Tr. 43-44, 66) \n \n \nDuring the hearing, the following testimony was provided:  \nDepartment Counsel: And you in fact noted that in your response to the \ninterrogatories that the images (of minors 17 and younger) would have had to have \nbeen there (on his computer) from either downloading, or you said you were \nviewing them on the internet. \n  \n\n \n4 \n \n \nApplicant: That\u2019s correct. That\u2019s why I have no idea. I have no idea specifically \nwhat it was that they (police) were looking for because they never said so. And \nthey never told my attorneys. And the first case that they (attorneys) were going to \nask them (DA) about it, they (DA) decided \u2013 they (DA) declined to even offer up \nanything. \n \nDepartment Counsel: Well, they (DA) offered up the pretrial diversion program. \n \nApplicant: Yeah, I\u2019m saying they (DA) offered up no evidence of any type of \nwrongdoing whatsoever. From the first time I was arrested, they told my attorney \nabsolutely nothing.  \n \nDepartment Counsel: Okay, as far as you know. \n \nApplicant: Yeah, as far as what my attorney has expressed to me. (Tr. 47) \n \nApplicant claimed the reason his previous DOD contractor employer stopped \npaying him in December 2015 was not related to his arrest, but due to him not working \non the contract. He was told he was going to be continued as an employee while his \ncurrent security clearance was placed on \u201chold.\u201d He acknowledged this employer \nterminated his employment, but he was unsure of the date. His employer filed an incident \nreport in the Joint Personnel Adjudication System since he was arrested while in \npossession of a DOD security clearance. Applicant admitted receiving a letter in the mail \nfrom his employer and then applying for unemployment benefits. He was initially denied \nunemployment benefits due to his gross negligence, \u201cfailing to report to work\u201d for three \nconsecutive days. Applicant appealed that decision, and he did receive unemployment \nbenefits for a few months. (Tr. 33-34, 52-55, 58) \n \nSOR \u00b6 2.a cross-referenced SOR \u00b6 1.a under Guideline E (Personal Conduct). \nApplicant denied in his response to the SOR that he was involved in any conduct that \nquestioned his judgment, candor, or willingness to comply with rules pertaining to his \nDecember 2015 arrest. He stated: \u201cThe court system found no grounds to pursue any \ncase against me, . . .\u201d Applicant failed to provide any court documentation to support his \ncontention.  \n \nSOR \u00b6 2.b alleges that Applicant intentionally misrepresented the criminal charge \nfrom his December 2015 arrest when he disclosed he had been charged with \u201cPossession \nof Obscene Materials,\u201d rather than \u201cPossession of Obscene Materials depicting a minor\u201d \non his September 2017 SCA. Applicant denied this allegation and stated he did not \nintentionally try to misrepresent this charge on his SCA. He listed the offense to put the \nGovernment on notice of his arrest, and he was not trying to conceal the nature of the \ncriminal offense in any way. \n \nApplicant disclosed information about his December 2015 arrest to his current \nDOD contractor employer. He also showed his employer the SOR and interrogatories. \nDespite this adverse information, his current employer continues to sponsor him for a \n\n \n5 \n \n \nDOD security clearance. The founder of the company appeared at the hearing, and stated \nthat he was aware of Applicant\u2019s security issues. He would not hesitate to place Applicant \nin a position of his company with full access to classified information. Three other \nwitnesses gave favorable recommendations for Applicant as well. (Tr. 59, 70. 76-79) \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the AG. In addition to brief introductory explanations \nfor each guideline, the AG list potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating \nconditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified \ninformation. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere \nspeculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 an \u201capplicant is responsible for \npresenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts \nadmitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the ultimate burden of \npersuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\u201d  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \n\n \n6 \n \n \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline D, Sexual Behavior \n \n \nThe security concern for sexual behavior is set out in AG \u00b6 12: \n \nSexual behavior that involves a criminal offense; reflects a lack of judgment \nor discretion; or may subject the individual to undue influence of coercion, \nexploitation, or duress. These issues, together or individually, may raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s judgment, reliability, trustworthiness, and \nability to protect classified or sensitive information. Sexual behavior \nincludes conduct occurring in person or via audio, visual, electronic, or \nwritten transmission. \u2026 \n \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. I have \nconsidered all of the disqualifying conditions under AG \u00b6 13, and the following are \npotentially applicable: \n \n(a) sexual behavior of a criminal nature, whether or not the individual has \nbeen prosecuted; and \n \n(c) sexual behavior that causes an individual to be vulnerable to coercion, \nexploitation, or duress.  \n \n \nIn December 2015, Applicant was arrested after the police executed a search \nwarrant at his home, and he was charged with pornography possession of obscene \nmaterial depicting minors, a felony. The charges were dismissed after he accepted a \npretrial intervention program with conditions. The conditions included that he attend \nweekly meetings for a two-year period with the state\u2019s sex offender group treatment \nprogram, and he pay approximately $1,250 in court costs. The charges were not \ndismissed for lack of evidence, which raises questions about his judgment and potential \nvulnerability to coercion, exploitation, and duress. If Applicant had not fulfilled the pretrial \nintervention program conditions, the DA could have refiled the charges and continued \nwith prosecution of the case against him. The above disqualifying conditions apply. \n \n \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising \nfrom sexual behavior. AG \u00b6 14 provides the following possible mitigating conditions: \n \n(a) the behavior occurred prior to or during adolescence and there is no \nevidence of subsequent conduct of similar nature; \n \n\n \n7 \n \n \n(b) the sexual behavior happened so long ago, so infrequently, or under \nsuch unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or judgment;  \n \n(c) the behavior no longer serves as a basis for coercion, exploitation, or \nduress;  \n \n \n(d) the sexual behavior is strictly private, consensual, and discreet; and \n \n(e) the individual has successfully completed an appropriate program of \ntreatment, or is currently enrolled in one, has demonstrated ongoing and \nconsistent compliance with the treatment plan, and/or has received a \nfavorable prognosis from a qualified mental health professional indicating \nthe behavior is readily controllable with treatment.  \n \n \n \nApplicant has continued to deny that the material confiscated by the police involved \nchild pornography, despite the fact he was arrested after the police executed a search \nwarrant at his home. He stated multiple times that the DA cancelled a meeting with his \nattorney. The purpose of this meeting was to show Applicant\u2019s attorney the incriminating \nevidence the DA had against him. Applicant alluded that the reason the DA offered to \ndismiss the charges against him was due to the fact that the DA did not have any evidence \nof child pornography. The established facts of record in the Government\u2019s exhibits do \ntend, however, to bring into question Applicant\u2019s judgment and current reliability. \nApplicant has completed a year-and-a-half of sexual offender treatment, but he does not \nadmit to viewing child pornography, to include an accidental image, over the span of \napproximately 25 years he has viewed pornography. I find his assertions unpersuasive. \nSince he has revealed the events to his wife and employer, \u00b6 14(c) applies, but is, in itself, \ninsufficient for a finding in his favor. I find \u00b6\u00b6 14(a), (b), (d), and (e) do not apply. \n \nGuideline E: Personal Conduct \n \n \nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the security concern for personal conduct:  \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. The following will normally result in \nan unfavorable national security eligibility determination, security clearance \naction, or cancellation of further processing for national security eligibility.  \n \n \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and be \ndisqualifying. The following are potentially applicable under the established facts in this \ncase: \n \n\n \n8 \n \n \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar \nform used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, \naward benefits or status, determine national security eligibility or \ntrustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities; and  \n \n(e) personal conduct, or concealment of information about one\u2019s conduct, \nthat creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress by a \nforeign intelligence entity or other individual or group. Such conduct \nincludes: \n \n(1) engaging in activities which, if known, could affect the \nperson\u2019s personal, professional, or community standing. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s sexual behavior (SOR \u00b6 1.a) was addressed under that specific \nguideline, and also cross-alleged (SOR \u00b6 2.a) under the personal conduct guideline. I \nhave previously addressed the issue under Guideline D. Disqualifying condition \u00b6 16 \n(e)(1) applies in this case. \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 2.b alleges that Applicant intentionally misrepresented the criminal charge \nhe listed on his 2017 SCA. There is insufficient evidence in the record to show that \nApplicant intentionally misrepresented or concealed the nature of his criminal charge \nwhen he disclosed his arrest on the 2017 SCA. Disqualifying condition \u00b6 16(a) does not \napply. \n \n \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising \nfrom personal conduct. The following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 17 are potentially \napplicable: \n \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or the behavior is so infrequent, or it happened under such \nunique circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on \nthe individual's reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, \nunreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to \nrecur;  \n \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate vulnerability \nto exploitation, manipulation, or duress; and  \n \n(f) the information was unsubstantiated or from a source of questionable \nreliability. \n \n\n \n9 \n \n \n \nApplicant has consistently denied that he viewed or possessed child pornography \nat any time. There is no evidence in the record to support his contention that the court \nsystem did not have any grounds to pursue criminal charges against him. He admitted \nduring the hearing that the DA did not dismiss \u201coutright\u201d the charges due to lack of \nevidence. Applicant also acknowledged that the DA could refile the charges against him \nif he did not complete the conditions outlined in his pretrial intervention program. His \ncontinued claim of innocence without supporting documentation is worrisome. To his \ncredit, Applicant completed a year-and-a-half of treatment and claimed that he has not \nviewed pornography for the last three years. He also told his wife and current employer \nabout the circumstances which resulted in his arrest. Mitigating condition \u00b6 17(e) does \nhave some application, but it is not enough for a favorable finding. His personal conduct \ncasts doubt on his reliability, trustworthiness, and overall good judgment. Mitigating \nconditions \u00b6\u00b6 17(c), (d), and (f) do not apply. \n \n \n \n \n \n  Whole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the potentially \ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and circumstances \nsurrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under Guideline D and \nGuideline E in my whole-person analysis. Applicant provided several favorable character \ntestimonials, to include support from his current employer, friends and associates. He \nadmitted being arrested, but denied he ever viewed child pornography. Applicant \nsuccessfully completed the conditions of his pretrial intervention program, and the \ncriminal charges against him were dismissed. Unfortunately, his favorable character \nevidence and his completion of a pretrial intervention program is not enough to absolve \nthe security concerns in this case.  \n \n \nApplicant averred the DA did not possess any evidence of child pornography \nagainst him, which was the reason he was offered the pretrial diversion program. He has \nviewed pornography for approximately 25 years, but denied that he has ever viewed an \n\n \n10 \n \n \nimage of a minor, even by accident, over that entire period of time. I find his assertions \nunpersuasive and unsubstantiated. Because protection of the national interest is the \nprinciple focus of these adjudications, any unresolved doubts must be resolved against \nthe granting of access to classified information.   \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline D:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.b:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national security to grant Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security \nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n               \n            \n \n \n \n \n \nPamela C. Benson \nAdministrative Judge \n",

Eligibility \nfor access to classified information is denied.  \nStatement of the Case \nOn March 23, 2018, the Department of Defense (DOD) issued a Statement of \nReasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing security concerns under Guideline G (alcohol \nconsumption). The action was taken under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) implemented by \nthe DOD on June 8, 2017. \nApplicant responded to the SOR on April 26, 2018, and elected to have the case \ndecided on the written record in lieu of a hearing. The Government\u2019s written case was \nsubmitted on June 28, 2018. A complete copy of the file of relevant material (FORM) \nwas provided to Applicant, who was afforded an opportunity to file objections and \nsubmit material to refute, extenuate, or mitigate the security concerns. Applicant \n03/08/2019\n\n \n2 \n \nreceived the FORM on August 31, 2018. Applicant did not respond to the Government\u2019s \nFORM. The case was assigned to me on December 10, 2018. The Government\u2019s \ndocuments identified as Items 1 through 6 are admitted in evidence without objection. \nOther than his Answer to the SOR, admitted into evidence as Item 3, Applicant failed to \nsubmit any additional documentation. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant admitted all of the SOR allegations.

He then drank four to five beers or hard liquor drinks \non the weekends at social gatherings. Before his April 2016 driving under the influence \n(DUI) conviction, further discussed below, he drank between five and fifteen beers on \nthe weekends. He described his drinking habits during his 2017 background interview \nas moderate, stating that he drank occasionally. In January 2017, he drank three beers \nand three glasses of champagne. In February 2017, he drank two beers with dinner. In \nJune 2017, he drank two beers. As of his 2018 response to interrogatories, he last \ndrank three glasses of champagne in December 2017.3 \n \n \nIn April 2000, Applicant was charged and convicted of DUI. He was 18 years old. \nHe was at a friend\u2019s sister\u2019s house and he drank two to three beers. He did not believe \nhe was intoxicated and he drove his friend home. He was pulled over by a police officer \nand administered a breathalyzer. Though his blood alcohol content (BAC) was .04%, \nthe officer arrested him because he was a minor. He was fined and his driver\u2019s license \nwas suspended for one year.4 \n                                                          \n1 Items 1, 3, 4.  \n \n2 Items 3-5.  \n \n3 Items 1, 3-6. \n \n4 Item 1, 3-6. \n \n\n \n3 \n \n \n \nIn September 2013, Applicant was charged and convicted of DUI. He had been \nwatching football at his cousin\u2019s house, where he drank six to seven beers. He did not \nbelieve he was intoxicated, attempted to drive home, and got into an accident. He was \narrested, administered a breathalyzer, and his BAC was .16%. He was fined, ordered to \ntake a drug and alcohol awareness course, and his driver\u2019s license was revoked for \nthree months. He complied with the court\u2019s sentence and his driver\u2019s license was \nreinstated in February 2014. Applicant stated during his 2015 background interview that \nhe had no future intentions of drinking and driving.5 \n \n \nIn April 2016, Applicant was charged with DUI. He was with friends watching a \nhockey game at a sports bar. He drove to the bar but planned to take an Uber home.   \nHe drank seven to eight beers and three to four shots of hard liquor over three hours. \nHe drove to a friend\u2019s house nearby, with the intention of sleeping off the alcohol before \ndriving home later. En route, he realized he was too drunk to drive so he pulled into a \nresidential neighborhood to sleep. He was arrested after a resident reported an \nunknown parked car in the neighborhood, and the officer smelled alcohol on him. He \nwas sentenced to one year of supervised probation, one year of a suspended driver\u2019s \nlicense, fined, 50 hours of community service, and DUI and victims awareness courses. \nHe was also ordered to attended counseling and treatment.6 \n \n \nApplicant attended an outpatient program consisting of 24 group counseling \nsessions, two individual sessions, and 12+ Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) meetings from \nMay to August 2017, when he completed the program. A discharge summary record \nreflects: \n \n[Applicant] accepted the consequences of his alcohol use and understands the \nrisks of continued use of any mood altering substance . . . He appears sincere \nabout remaining substance fee.7 \n \nHis discharge diagnosis reflects an Axis I diagnosis of \u201cAlcohol Abuse (In Remission) \u2013 \nF10.10,\u201d states that his prognosis is \u201cGood, if [Applicant] follows recommendations,\u201d and \nrecommends that Applicant abstain from all mood altering drugs and continue AA \nattendance.8 \n \n \nIn his October 2017 background interview, Applicant stated that he did not \nbelieve he had an alcohol dependence issue, but he considered himself an alcoholic \nbased on information he obtained from the counseling sessions. Though he stated that \nhe does so only rarely, he acknowledged in both his 2017 background interview and his \n2018 response to the SOR that he still consumed alcohol. He decided to decrease his \n                                                          \n5 Items 1, 3-6. \n \n6 Item 1, 3-6. \n \n7 Item 1, 3-6. \n \n8 Item 3. \n\n \n4 \n \nalcohol consumption because he learned from the counseling sessions that alcohol \ncould negatively impact him. He sold both of his vehicles and decided to bicycle or Uber \nwherever he goes. He stated that he previously drank alcohol to feel happy and relieve \nwork stress, but realized that he could exercise and listen to music instead. He did not \nprovide evidence of continued AA attendance. He stated that his DUIs are common \nknowledge among his family and friends.9 \n \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.  \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \n                                                          \n9 Item 1, 3-6. \n \n\n \n5 \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline G, Alcohol Consumption \n \n \nThe security concern for alcohol consumption is set out in AG \u00b6 21: \n \nExcessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable \njudgment or the failure to control impulses, and can raise questions about \nan individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness. \n \nThe guideline notes conditions that could raise security concerns under AG \u00b6 22. \nThe disqualifying conditions potentially applicable in this case include:   \n \n(a) alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while under \nthe influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or \nother incidents of concern, regardless of the frequency of the individual\u2019s \nalcohol use or whether the individual has been diagnosed with alcohol use \ndisorder; and \n \n(c) habitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point of impaired \njudgment, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed with alcohol \nuse disorder. \n \n \nApplicant has a pattern of excessive alcohol consumption and alcohol-related \nincidents away from work. AG \u00b6\u00b6 22(a) and 22(c) are applicable. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 23 provides the following relevant conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns: \n \n(a) so much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, \nor judgment; \n \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her pattern of maladaptive alcohol \nuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and \nhas demonstrated a clear and established pattern of modified \nconsumption \nor \nabstinence \nin \naccordance \nwith \ntreatment \nrecommendations; and \n \n(d) the individual has successfully completed a treatment program along \nwith any required aftercare, and has demonstrated a clear and established \n\n \n6 \n \npattern of modified consumption or abstinence in accordance with \ntreatment recommendations. \n \nApplicant\u2019s pattern of excessive alcohol consumption and alcohol-related \nincidents did not happen under unusual circumstances that are unlikely to recur, are \nrecent, and are not mitigated by the passage of time. Though Applicant was diagnosed \nupon discharge from treatment in 2017 with alcohol abuse in remission, he was \nrecommended to abstain from all mood altering substances and continue AA. Yet, he \nadmitted that he still consumed alcohol and he did not provide evidence of continued \nAA attendance. AG \u00b6\u00b6 23(a), 23(b), and 23(d) are not established. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the \npotentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and \ncircumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline G in this whole-person analysis. I considered Applicant\u2019s honorable military \nservice and his deployments overseas.  \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude Applicant failed \nto mitigate the alcohol consumption security concerns.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline G:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.c: \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \n\n \n7 \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security \nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n \n________________________ \nCandace Le\u2019i Garcia \nAdministrative Judge \n",

Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information.

Controlled substance means any \u201ccontrolled substance\u201d \nas defined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term \nadopted in this guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above. \n \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 25. The following are potentially applicable in this case:   \n \n \n(a) any substance misuse (see above definition);  \n \n(c) illegal possession of a controlled substance, including cultivation, \nprocessing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of \ndrug paraphernalia; and \n \n(f) any illegal drug use while granted access to classified information or \nholding a sensitive position. \n \n \nApplicant possessed and used marijuana sporadically from 2001 through 2008, \nand again over the course of a few weeks in October 2015. She has held a security \nclearance since 2011. AG \u00b6\u00b6 25(a), 25(c), and 25(f) are applicable. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 26 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. The following \nare potentially applicable:  \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \nand \n \n\n \n5 \n \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this \nproblem, and has established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not \nlimited to: \n \n \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; \n \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; \nand \n \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that any future \ninvolvement or misuse is grounds for revocation of national security \neligibility.  \n \n \nApplicant experimented with marijuana while she was in college and graduate \nschool. During her background interview in 2010, she stated that she regretted using \nmarijuana and she did not intend to use marijuana or any other illegal drug in the future. \nShe abstained from 2008 until she used marijuana to alleviate her pain in 2015. She \nknew that her marijuana use was against federal law and contrary to her company\u2019s and \nDOD\u2019s policies, even though it was not illegal under local law and even if it had been \nprescribed by a doctor. However, she did not realize the full ramifications of her actions. \nHaving gone through this process, I am convinced that she does now.   \n \n \nApplicant provided a signed statement of intent to abstain from all illegal drug use \nwith the acknowledgment that any future involvement with illegal drugs would be \ngrounds for revocation of her security clearance. She credibly testified that she will not \nuse any illegal drugs, including marijuana for pain management, in the future. She fully \ndisclosed her drug use on her SF 86 and during her background investigation, which \nbolsters her credibility. I find that Applicant has abstained from illegal drug use for an \nappropriate period, and that illegal drug use is unlikely to recur. AG \u00b6\u00b6 26(a) and 26(b) \nare applicable. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \n\n \n6 \n \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the \npotentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and \ncircumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline H in my whole-person analysis. I also considered Applicant\u2019s strong character \nevidence. \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude Applicant \nmitigated the drug involvement and substance misuse security concerns. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline H:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.b: \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIt is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \n \n \n \n________________________ \nEdward W. Loughran \nAdministrative Judge \n",

Henderson, Esq., Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Catie E. Young, Attorney At Law, Griffith, Young & Lass \n \n \nMarch 25, 2019 \n______________ \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \n \nLOKEY ANDERSON, Darlene D., Administrative Judge: \n \nOn April 25, 2016, Applicant submitted a security clearance application (e-QIP). \nOn January 24, 2018, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications Facility \n(DoD CAF) issued Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR), detailing security concerns \nunder Guideline F Financial Considerations.  The action was taken under Executive \nOrder (EO)10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, \n1960), as amended; DoD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security \nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the \nAdjudicative Guidelines, effective within the DoD after June 8, 2019.  \n \nApplicant answered the SOR on April 30, 2018, and requested a hearing before \nan administrative judge. The case was assigned to me on June 15, 2018.  The Defense \nOffice of Hearings and Appeals issued a notice of hearing on November 15, 2018, and \nthe hearing was convened as scheduled on December 7, 2018. The Government \noffered four exhibits, referred to as Government Exhibits 1 through 4, which were \nadmitted without objection. The Applicant offered seven exhibits, referred to as \nApplicant\u2019s Exhibits A through G, which were admitted without objection.  Applicant \ntestified on his own behalf. The record remained open until close of business on \n\n \n2 \n \nJanuary 11, 2019, to allow the Applicant the opportunity to submit additional supporting \ndocumentation.  Applicant submitted four Post-Hearing Exhibits, referred to as \nApplicant\u2019s Post-Hearing Exhibits H through K, which were admitted without objection.  \nDOHA received the transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on January 11, 2019. \n \n \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant is 64 years old. He is married with four grown children.  He has two \nMaster\u2019s degrees, one in Business Administration, and one in Law.  He also holds \nvarious certifications.  He is employed with a defense contractor as a Technology \nConsultant/Engineer.  He is applying for a security clearance in connection with his \nemployment.    \n \nGuideline F - Financial Considerations \n \n \n \nThe Government alleged that Applicant is ineligible for a clearance because he \nmade financial decisions that indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which raise questions about his \nreliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified information. The SOR \nidentified four delinquent student loan or educational debts totaling in excess of \n$100,000, as well as a Chapter 7 bankruptcy wherein he discharged approximately $3.5 \nmillion in delinquent debt, most of which were delinquent mortgage accounts for six \nforeclosed properties.  Applicant admits each of the allegations set forth in the SOR \nunder this guideline.    Applicant has been working for his current employer since April \n2016.  Credit Reports of Applicant dated July 9, 2016; and June 6, 2017, confirm the \nindebtedness listed in the SOR.  (Government Exhibits 3 and 4.)   \n \nApplicant has a steady employment history.  (Government Exhibit 1.)  His wife, \nwith whom he has been married for 35 years, also worked outside the home for a time, \nand generated income for the family.  Applicant\u2019s explained that his wife is from a family \nof real estate professionals and at some point, she became a real estate broker.  From \n2001 to 2006, with the growing real estate economy in the state, Applicant and his wife \ntook their excess disposable income, and purchased a number of investment properties, \nin hopes of it sustaining their expenses.  At the time, Applicant was sending his four \nchildren to a prestigious private school and lived a comfortable lifestyle.   \n \nIn 2006, Applicant\u2019s wife began to have a series of health problems which \neventually caused her to stop working.  By this time their children were in college and \nApplicant had cosigned for their student loans.  As the value of their real estate \nproperties started declining, renters started defaulting on rent.   Applicant could not \nafford to pay the mortgages on their properties, nor did he have the money to pay his \nchildren\u2019s student loans.  He tried to get deferments, or forbearance type of extensions \non the student loan debt, but was unsuccessful.  During this period, Applicant even \nrelocated without his wife to take a higher paying job.  More, recently, he has had to \nmove his mother-in-law in with them, to take care of her.   \n \n\n \n3 \n \n1.a.  In 2013, to clear up his financial problems, Applicant hired an attorney who \nrecommended that they file for Chapter 7 Bankruptcy protection.  In June 2013, \nApplicant filed for Chapter 7 Bankruptcy, and in September 2013, his debts of \napproximately $3.5 million were discharged.  Applicant was unable to discharge the \nstudent loans pursuant to Federal Bankruptcy Law.  Related to this filing, Applicant \nreceived a certificate of financial counseling.  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit A.)  \n \n1.b.  Applicant is indebted to a creditor for a student loan that was past due in the \namount of $2,231 with an approximate balance of $48,319.  Applicant cosigned on his \ndaughter\u2019s student loan for college.  When he entered into the agreement, he thought \nthat his daughter would be able to pay the debt.  The debt has been owing since 2009.  \nApplicant has tried to initiate payment by website, but his account cannot be located.  \n(Tr. p. 43)  It is his intent to pay the debt if he can find out who to pay.  He has also \ndisputed the debt with the credit agencies.  (Tr. p. 78.)  Applicant\u2019s Post-Hearing Exhibit \nK indicates that Applicant has been made an offer to settle the debt by the creditor in \nthe amount of $371 monthly for eleven months beginning on January 15, 2019, with a \nballoon payment of $5,919 due on December 15, 2019.     \n \n1.c.  Applicant was indebted to a bank for a delinquent student loan that was charged \noff in the approximate amount of $31,976.  Applicant cosigned on his son\u2019s student loan \nfor college.  When he entered into the agreement, he thought that his son would be able \nto pay the debt.  This debt was ultimately charged off.  Applicant received a 1099-C \ncancellation of debt regarding the debt.  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibits B and I.)  Applicant stated \nthat he has paid taxes on the amount of the forgiveness.  (Tr. p. 48.)       \n \n1.d and 1.e.  Applicant was indebted to a bank for two educational loan accounts that \nwere charged off.  Applicant cosigned on his childrens\u2019 loans for their education.  Both \nloans were ultimately charged off by the creditor.   Applicant received a 1099-C for each \ndebt, which was a cancellation of the debts.  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit C, and Tr. p. 51.)  \nApplicant stated that he has paid taxes on the amount of the forgiveness.  (Tr. pp. 51-\n52.) \n \nApplicant\u2019s credit report showed another charged-off account, not listed in the \nSOR, in the amount of $31,997, showing a past-due amount of $30,597.  Applicant did \nnot know about the debt.  Post-Hearing Exhibit H, indicates that the creditor has \nextended an offer to Applicant to make payment arrangements to resolve the debt. \n \nSince he has been working for his current employer, Applicant\u2019s financial affairs \nhave been more stable.  He has incurred no new delinquent debt.  He now owns only \none property, his primary residence, and is current on the mortgage payments.  \n(Applicant\u2019s Exhibit D.)  Applicant is also current with all of his consumer debt.  He has \nlearned a hard lesson from his mistakes in the past.  He now lives within a budget, and \nmakes smart decisions as to how he spends his money.  Applicant recently started a \n401(k) that has about $3,000 in it.  (Tr. p. 53.) \n \nLetters of recommendation from Applicant\u2019s colleagues and friends reveal that \nApplicant is a true professional, who is committed to work, his family, and enjoying the \n\n \n4 \n \nfreedoms our country provides.  He is respected by all who know him.  He has \nconsistently provided exceptional work effort and productivity.  He is also described as \nbeing a hard-working, honest and trustworthy man of integrity, who is a wonderful \nfather, co-worker, friend and human being.  He is highly recommended for a security \nclearance.  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit F.)     \n \n \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious \nscrutiny of a number of variables known as the whole-person concept. The \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record.  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d  \n \n \nA person who applies for access to classified information seeks to enter into a \nfiduciary relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n \n\n \n5 \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \n \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG \u00b6 18: \n \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. Three are potentially applicable in this case:   \n \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; \n \n(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so; and \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \n \n  \nApplicant became delinquently indebted due to a series of unexpected \ncircumstances beyond his control.  In hindsight, Applicant realizes that he made some \nrisky and reckless decisions when he invested in real estate too quickly, and in too \nmany properties, without a sufficient financial safety net.  To complicate matters, his \nwife\u2019s illnesses prevented her from working, which negatively impacted their finances.  \nThe sudden downturn in the real estate market also caused them to fall behind on their \nmortgage payments.  Applicant\u2019s children\u2019s inability and unwillingness to pay their \nstudent loans, leaving it all up to the Applicant, all contributed to his financial \nindebtedness.  The evidence is sufficient to raise the above disqualifying conditions.  \n \n\n \n6 \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. I considered \nall of the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 including: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control; and \n \n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \notherwise resolve debts. \n \nApplicant now understands the vastly unstable nature of the real estate market \nand that it can ruin one\u2019s financial status, if not careful.  As a result, in 2013, he was \nforced to file for Chapter 7 bankruptcy, and discharged $3.5 million dollars in debt.  \nUnable to discharge the student loans, and unable to afford to make the payments, the \ndebts were charged off.  Applicant has paid taxes on the student loan debt that was \ncancelled or forgiven, and plans to follow a prescribed payment plan to resolve the only \nother remaining student loan that remains unaddressed in the SOR.  Applicant\u2019s \nconduct shows growth and maturity toward handling his financial affairs.  He has no \nother delinquent accounts and now understands the importance of maintaining financial \nresponsibility.  Going forward, Applicant must live within his means and continue to \nresolve his debts in compliance with his creditors.  Under the particular circumstances \nof this case, Applicant has acted reasonably and responsibly with respect to his debts.  \nAccordingly, it is found that his debts are now under control.  Furthermore, Applicant \nhas demonstrated that future financial problems are unlikely.  If it is determined that he \nowes any other creditor, he will immediately set up a payment arrangement to resolve it.  \nThere are clear indications that his financial problems are being resolved.  \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n\n \n7 \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept.  \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline F in my whole-person analysis.  Applicant is well respected on the job and \nperformed favorably.  He has also demonstrated reasonable and responsible conduct in \nresolving his delinquent debts.  In addition, he has provided documentation from the \ncreditors that confirm his testimony.  Applicant has demonstrated that he is financially \nresponsible.          \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions and doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant has mitigated the Financial Considerations security concerns.  \n \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.b:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.c:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.d:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.e:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.  National security eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \n \n \n \n \nDarlene Lokey Anderson \nAdministrative Judge \n",

Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.  \nStatement of the Case \nOn January 29, 2018, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications \nFacility (DOD CAF) issued to Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security \nconcerns under Guideline F, financial considerations. The action was taken under \nExecutive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry \n(February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel \nSecurity Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the \nadjudicative guidelines (AG) effective on June 8, 2017. \nApplicant answered the SOR on February 17, 2018, and requested a hearing \nbefore an administrative judge. The case was assigned to me on October 1, 2018. The \nDefense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a notice of hearing on October \n12, 2018.

He denied the \nallegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b. After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings, \ntestimony, and exhibits submitted, I make the following findings of fact. \n \n \nApplicant is 60 years old. He earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in 1982. He married in \n1984 and divorced in 1994. He remarried in 1999 and has a 16-year-old child from that \nmarriage and an adult stepchild. He has worked for his present employer, a federal \ncontractor, since August 2016. Applicant completed a security clearance application \n(SCA) in April 2017. He disclosed short periods of unemployment between contracts. He \ntestified that he worked part-time from May 2014 to December 2014. He disclosed he was \nunemployed from February 2007 to October 2008. He received unemployment \ncompensation for this period. He testified that his current salary is $120,000. His wife \nchose not to work in the past year so she could spend time with her grandchild.2  \n \n \nDuring his July 2017 interview with a government investigator, Applicant was \nconfronted with the debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.a ($46,926). He did not disclose this debt on \nhis SCA. He told the investigator that this was due to an error. He told the investigator \nthat he believed this account may have related to a former home mortgage in 2013. The \naccount was sold many times, and he believed the current creditor may hold the equity \nloan. The equity loan went delinquent after he did a short sale on his former residence in \nJanuary 2014, but he was unaware that there was an open collection account for the loan. \nHe intended to attempt to reach a settlement with the creditor and pay off the balance as \nsoon as possible.3  \n \n \nIn Applicant\u2019s answer to the SOR, he denied the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.a. He stated:  \n \n \nI do not any have any recollection of this debt being mine or its origin (sic). \nThis debt no longer appears on my credit report and my preliminary \ninvestigation shows this debt to be at least 10 years old. I was going to \ndispute this debt, but my research shows that it is beyond the statute of \n                                                          \n1 Hearing Exhibit (HE) I is the exhibit list and II is the discovery letter.

He had another \naccount with the same creditor that was in good standing. He said he contacted this \ncreditor in January 2018, but did not ask about this debt because he said it does not \nbelong to him. He claimed he had a checking account stolen in 2006. He did not file a \npolice report. He did not contact anyone about this account. He said he was not contacted \nby a collection company. He stated it is only reported on one credit report. He disputes \nits accuracy. He said he was not going to dispute a 10-year-old debt. He admitted that he \nwas worried about the statute of limitations resetting.5  \n \n \nApplicant further stated that he had a lawyer when he had to do a short sale on his \nhouse. He was told by the lawyer not to pay any of his debts, but he continued to pay his \ndebts. His lawyer advised him to file bankruptcy, but he did not want to do that. He \nestimated this occurred around 2010. He did a short sale on his house in 2014 because \nhe had trouble making mortgage payments and was living off of credit cards. He further \nstated that he had one unsettled debt with this same creditor for an equity loan, and he \nassumed this was the same debt. He also stated that based on the amount of the debt \nhe believed it was likely the same debt. The account is listed on his May 2017 credit \nreport, which shows the account was opened in June 2013, and the last activity was in \nApril 2017.6 The debt is unresolved.  \n \n \nApplicant was also confronted by the investigator with all of the debts alleged in \nthe SOR. He had disclosed on his SCA that he settled the debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b ($88), 1.c \n($224), and 1.e ($74) with collection companies by making prescribed payments. During \nhis interview, he stated these debts were for utilities owed on a former residence. He did \nnot receive the bills when he moved and later learned the accounts were delinquent and \nin collection. He told the investigator when he became aware of the debts, he contacted \nthe original creditors and was advised the debts were held by collection companies. He \nsaid he made an error on his SCA, and the debts were not settled or paid as reported. He \ntold the investigator that he was aware all three accounts remained unpaid. He said he \nwas upset that he was not contacted by the original creditors before the accounts were \nplaced in collection. He did not want to pay the collection agencies because they bought \nthe debt for a much lower amount of money than what he owed. He does not agree with \nthe collection process in general and would have no problem paying the original creditors \ndirectly. He would pay the delinquent collection accounts if it is required for him to obtain \na security clearance, but otherwise he did not intend to pay the debts as it will have a \nnegative effect on his credit score regardless.7 \n                                                          \n4 Answer to SOR. \n \n5 Tr. 34-36. \n \n6 Tr. 28-38, 64-65. \n \n7 GE 1, 2. In his SCA, Applicant disclosed he had utilities bills that were in collection status. Applicant stated, \n\u201cSettled debt with collections by making prescribed payments.\u201d  \n\n \n4 \n \n \nIn his answer to the SOR, Applicant denied the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.b. He stated he \nhad no recollection of this debt belonging to him or its origin. He was unsuccessful in his \n\u201cinitial attempts to dispute the debt and decided to not pursue any correction to the credit \nreport as this debt is no longer listed.\u201d Applicant stated he has a current account with this \ncreditor. Applicant testified that he contacted the creditor in SOR \u00b6 1.b and was told it no \nlonger had a record of any unpaid account. He said he tried to pay the original creditor. \nApplicant\u2019s testimony is inconsistent with his SCA disclosure and statements made to the \ngovernment investigator.8 This debt is unresolved.  \n \nIn Applicant\u2019s answer to the SOR, Applicant acknowledged owing the debts in \u00b6\u00b6 \n1.c and 1.e. He reiterated he was unaware the accounts were in collection until 2017. He \ndid not want to pay a collection company because the debts already had a negative \nimpact on his credit rating. He did not intend to pay them. He stated that he is now aware \nof his error and contacted the collection companies for the debts in \u00b6\u00b6 1.c and 1.e, and \npaid the accounts. He provided documented proof of his payments.9 The debts are \nresolved. \n \n \nApplicant was confronted by the government investigator with the debt alleged in \nSOR \u00b6 1.d ($9,253). He failed to disclose this debt on his SCA. He told the investigator \nhis failure to report the debt was due to error. He acknowledged the debt to the \ninvestigator and explained it was a credit card debt that became delinquent in 2013. He \nwas offered a settlement agreement by the creditor in 2013, but he could not afford to pay \nit. The debt was charged off. Applicant told the investigator that he received a cancelation \nof the debt for 2014 and it was included in his 2014 tax return.10  \n \n \nIn Applicant\u2019s answer to the SOR, he admitted the debt in \u00b6 1.d and said the debt \nbecame delinquent in 2014 after the early termination of a contract he was working on. \nHe said he contacted the creditor because he could not pay the debt. He could not pay \nthe settlement offer and the account became delinquent. He said when he resumed \nemployment, and after he caught up on all of his past due accounts, he learned the debt \nwas charged off. He said in his answer:  \n \nIn addition, I had not received any collection notices so I thought this debt \nwas already included as income for me. I see now that I was wrong. Even \nthough the account shows it has been charged off, there is still an \noutstanding balance showing, and even though I have negative feelings \nabout how the customer service at [creditor] treated me relative to all the \nother creditors who were willing to work with me during my unexpected \nemployment, I understand I owe what I owe. I was contacted by [creditor] \nearlier this month and I have agreed to a repayment plan. This plan requires \n                                                          \n8 Tr. 39-48. \n \n9 Tr. 48-50, 58; Answer to SOR. \n \n10 GE 2. \n\n \n5 \n \n \nless than the full amount because I have agreed to repay them in 1 year \ninstead of 5.11  \n \n \nApplicant testified that in 2014 he tried to work out an agreement with the creditor \nin SOR \u00b6 1.d, but could not afford the payments. He said he thought this debt was included \nas a cancelation of debt and an IRS 1099C form was issued. He did not attempt to pay \nthe debt until after he received the SOR because he did not want to restart the statute of \nlimitations clock.12 Applicant provided a copy of the settlement agreement to pay $385 a \nmonth for 12 months for a total settlement of $4,626. He also provided proof that he has \nmade payments from March through August 2018.13 It is being resolved.  \n \n \nApplicant testified that he does not owe the collection companies and does not \nhave an obligation to them. He did not borrow money from the collection company. He \nstated: \u201cI paid every debt that I could research and find that were mine.\u201d18 \n \n \nThe Government\u2019s evidence included five IRS 1099-C Cancelation of Debt forms \nfrom the same creditor for tax year 2014. The amounts of the canceled debts were $7,859, \n$9,637, $2,409, $4,925 and $1,453. An additional IRS 1099-C form was also included as \nevidence from a different creditor in the amount of $3,448.19 These discharged debts \nwere not alleged in the SOR. The allegations in the SOR are supported by Applicant\u2019s \nadmissions, testimony, and credit reports from May 2017 and January 2018.20 \n \n \nApplicant testified that when he understood he was required to pay collection \naccounts he did. He admitted he had to rely on credit cards for a period after his \nunemployment to pay his bills. He also stated that he had investments that did not work \nout. He participated in financial counseling as part of the Home Affordable Refinance \nProgram. His current finances are better. He has four or five credit cards that he pays \nmonthly and have a cumulative balance of approximately $14,000. He owns four vehicles, \nincluding a 2018 recently purchased car. At the end of the month, he has several hundred \ndollars in expendable income. He does not have any savings and has about $20,000 in \na 401K account. Post-hearing, Applicant provided copies of credit reports from November \n                                                          \n11 Answer to SOR. \n \n12 Tr. 50-58. \n \n13 AE A. An additional document was provided of a check transfer made in October 2018 that shows a $400 \ntransaction.

I have not considered any derogatory information that was not alleged for disqualifying \npurposed. I may consider it when making a credibility determination, in the application of mitigating \nconditions, and in a whole-person analysis.  \n \n20 GE 1, 2, 3, 4. \n\n \n6 \n \n \n2018 from the three major credit bureaus. The debt in SOR \u00b6 1.a is not reported on \nthem.21 \n \n \nApplicant made numerous inconsistent statements in his government interview, \nanswer to the SOR, and testimony. I did not find him credible.  \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility, the administrative judge \nmust consider the AG. In addition to brief introductory explanations for each guideline, \nthe adjudicative guidelines list potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating \nconditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified \ninformation. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere \nspeculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 states an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\u201d  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n                                                          \n21 Tr. 71-77. AE D, E, F. One vehicle is a vintage car that Applicant has registered and insured, but does \nnot drive. \n\n \n7 \n \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for financial considerations is set out \nin AG & 18:  \n \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \n \nAG \u00b6 19 provides conditions that could raise security concerns. The following are \npotentially applicable:  \n \n(a) inability to satisfy debts;  \n \n(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so; and \n \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \n \n \nApplicant has delinquent debts that began accumulating in about 2013 that he was \nunable and unwilling to pay. There is sufficient evidence to support the application of the \nabove disqualifying conditions. \n \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising \nfrom financial difficulties. The following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially \napplicable: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n\n \n8 \n \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control;  \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue.  \n \n \nApplicant has been aware he had delinquent debts that he did not want to pay \nbecause he did not like the collection agency process. He told the government \ninvestigator that he would pay the debts if his security clearance was contingent on it. He \neventually paid the debts that were in collection in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c and 1.e. He claimed the \ndebt in SOR \u00b6 1.d had been canceled by the creditor, and it was included in his 2014 tax \nreturns. He later acknowledged it was not canceled, and after receiving the SOR he made \npayment arrangements. Applicant also acknowledged he had a large equity loan \nassociated with his house that went through a short sale. He told the investigator he would \ncontact the creditor and resolve the debt. He later denied the debt. He failed to contact \nthe creditor and stated the debt was over 10 years old and subject to the statute of \nlimitation. Applicant could have called the creditor, and determined the origin of the debt, \nbut he refused to do so. There is sufficient evidence this debt belongs to Applicant, \nalthough it is no longer listed on his current credit reports. Applicant repeatedly provided \ninconsistent information and testimony about his debts. There is insufficient evidence to \nconclude future financial problems are unlikely to recur. Applicant\u2019s conduct casts doubt \non his reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. AG \u00b6 20(a) does not apply.  \n \n \nApplicant attributed his financial problems to periods of unemployment, which were \nbeyond his control. For the full application of AG \u00b6 20(b), Applicant must have acted \nresponsibly under the circumstances. Applicant has been employed since August 2016. \nHe told the government investigator that he did not want to pay collection agencies on \ndebts he legitimately knew he owed because he does not like the process. He would only \ndo so if he was required to do so in order to obtain his security clearance. After receiving \nthe SOR he paid the delinquent utilities bills owed. He was not happy with the creditor in \nSOR \u00b6 1.d, but eventually arranged a payment plan after receiving the SOR. He \npreviously claimed the debt was included in his 2014 tax return, but that information was \nincorrect. He acknowledged during his interview that he had an equity loan associated \n\n \n9 \n \n \nwith the short sale of his house. He said his lawyer told him not to pay his debts. He was \ngoing to contact the creditor and resolve the debt. Later he denied owing the debt and \nhas not contacted the creditor. Applicant has not acted responsibly regarding his debts. \nAG \u00b6 20(b) partially applies.  \n \n \nApplicant said he went through financial counseling when he participated in HARP. \nHe is making payments on one debt, but has not resolved or contacted the creditor for \nthe debt in SOR \u00b6 1.a. He did not resolve the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.b. There is some evidence \nthat his finances are coming under control, but his failure to address the largest debt \nalleged is a concern. I find \u00b6 AG 20(c) marginally applies. Applicant paid the debts in SOR \n\u00b6\u00b6 1.c and 1.e after receiving the SOR. He made payment arrangements for the debt in \nSOR \u00b6 1.d after receiving the SOR. AG \u00b6 20(d) applies to these debts.  \n \n \nApplicant told the government investigator that the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.a was related \nto an equity loan. He explained how it originated. He intended to resolve it with the \ncreditor. He later denied knowing anything about the debt. He refused to contact the \ncreditor to determine its origin and validity. There is sufficient proof that the debt belongs \nto him. Throughout this investigative process, Applicant has made inconsistent \nstatements. Regardless of whether the debt is beyond the statute of limitation, which he \nfailed to show, Applicant has not resolved it. I have considered the fact that it is not listed \non his most current credit reports. AG \u00b6 20(e) does not apply.  \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.  \n       \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline F in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were \naddressed under that guideline, but some warrant additional comment. \n\n \n10 \n \n \nApplicant is 60 years old. He experienced periods of unemployment that impacted \nhis finances. Applicant had six debts totaling approximately $29,731 that were canceled \nin 2014. He has resolved two small debts alleged in the SOR and has a payment \narrangement for another debt. Applicant did not take action on these debts until after he \nreceived the SOR. He told the government investigator that he would not pay debts that \nwere held by collection agencies because he did not like the process, but would pay the \ndebts if it would impact his ability to obtain a security clearance. Applicant acknowledged \nthe largest debt owed in SOR \u00b6 1.a to the government investigator and then denied it. He \nfailed to contact the creditor as he said he would. Applicant repeatedly provided \ncontradictory statements and testimony. He has an unreliable financial track record. \nAlthough he eventually paid some debts or is paying them, he was aware they were \nlegitimate, but did not attempt to resolve them until after he received the SOR. The record \nevidence leaves me with serious questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and \nsuitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant failed to \nmitigate the security concerns arising under Guideline F, financial considerations.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.b: \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.c-1.e: \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national security to grant Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security \nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nCarol G.

His admissions are incorporated into the findings of fact. After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings and exhibits submitted, I make the following additional findings of fact. Applicant is 44 years old. He was born in Djibouti in 1975. He graduated from high school there and completed his college in France in 1998. He immigrated to the United States in 2008. He became a U.S. citizen in November 2015. He is divorced and has two children. His ex-wife and both children are U.S. citizens and residents.

Nagel, Esq., Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro se \n \n12/09/2019 \n \n______________ \n \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \n \nCOACHER, Robert E., Administrative Judge: \n \nApplicant failed to mitigate the security concerns under Guidelines E and B, \npersonal conduct and foreign influence. Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance is \ndenied. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nOn October 25, 2018, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications \nFacility (DOD CAF) issued Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security \nconcerns under Guideline B, foreign influence and Guideline E, personal conduct. DOD \nCAF acted under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information \nwithin Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense \nIndustrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as \namended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG), effective within the DOD on \nJune 8, 2017.  \n \n\n \n2 \n \n \nApplicant answered the SOR on April 16, 2019. He requested a hearing before \nan administrative judge. The case was assigned to me on June 18, 2019. The Defense \nOffice of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a notice of hearing on June 19, 2019, \nwith a hearing date of July 24, 2019. Because of a miscommunication, Applicant did \nnot attend the hearing scheduled on July 24, 2019. I granted a continuance and DOHA \nissued a subsequent notice of hearing on September 10, 2019, with a hearing date of \nSeptember 25, 2019. The hearing was convened as scheduled. The Government \noffered exhibits (GE) 1 through 5, which were admitted into evidence without objection, \nexcept for GE 2 to which Applicant objected and I sustained. I included GE 2 in the \nrecord, but did not consider it. The Government\u2019s exhibit list was marked as a hearing \nexhibit (HE) I. Applicant testified and offered exhibits (AE) A-H (which were attached to \nhis answer), which were admitted without objection. DOHA received the hearing \ntranscript (Tr.) on October 7, 2019.  \n \nProcedural Ruling \n \nDepartment Counsel requested that I take administrative notice of certain facts \nrelating to Djibouti. Applicant did not object and the request was granted. The request \nwas not admitted into evidence but was included in the record as HE II. The facts \nadministratively noticed are set out in the Findings of Fact, below.   \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nIn Applicant\u2019s answer to the SOR, he admitted some of the SOR allegations and \ndenied one (SOR \u00b6 1.a). His admissions are incorporated into the findings of fact. After \na thorough and careful review of the pleadings and exhibits submitted, I make the \nfollowing additional findings of fact. \n \n \nApplicant is 44 years old. He was born in Djibouti in 1975. He graduated from \nhigh school there and completed his college in France in 1998. He immigrated to the \nUnited States in 2008. He became a U.S. citizen in November 2015. He is divorced \nand has two children. His ex-wife and both children are U.S. citizens and residents. He \nis currently unemployed, except he is driving for a car service. (Tr. 7, 26, 31, 33; GE 1, \n3 AE D-E) \n \nUnder Guideline E, the SOR alleged that the Applicant failed to disclose the \nexistence of two brothers and six sisters on his April 2017 security clearance \napplication (SCA); and that on December 2015, he sent threatening texts and voice \nmessages to a classmate who was in his training class. (\u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.b). Under Guideline \nB, the SOR alleged that Applicant\u2019s father is a retired Djiboutian congressman; that his \nbrother is employed by the United Nations office of West Africa; that another brother is \na colonel in the Djiboutian Army; that two sisters are employed by the Djiboutian \ngovernment agency; that another sister is a former Djiboutian congresswoman; that \nanother sister is the chief executive officer (CEO) of a major Djiboutian cable channel; \nthat a brother-in-law is a former Djiboutian ambassador; that a brother-in-law is a \n\n \n3 \n \n \ncounselor to a Djiboutian ministry; and that a brother-in-law is a retired Djiboutian \ncabinet member. \n \n \nIn approximately 1999, Applicant was hired by the Djibouti Ministry of Foreign \nAffairs and was sent overseas to work as a counselor. His brother-in-law was the \nambassador to the country at the time. Applicant later returned to Djibouti and quit \nworking for the government. He joined an opposition political party and began writing \nnewspaper articles in support of this political movement. He claimed these actions \ncaused derision with his family. He subsequently sought and was granted political \nasylum in the United States. He has not traveled outside the United States since 2008. \n(Tr. 26, 28; GE 3; AE D) \n \n \nIn December 2015, while attending a police academy course, Applicant \nthreatened a school administrator and a fellow student because he was failing the \ncourse. The threats were communicated by telephone and text messages. Several of \nthe texts were captured and submitted to school authorities. Applicant admitted this \nbehavior in his answer. As a result of his actions, Applicant was expelled from the \nacademy, barred from the academy campus, and charged with criminal harassment. \nHe was convicted and sentenced to one year of probation, fined, required to perform \ncommunity service, and attend anger management. He has had no similar incidents. I \nnote that when Applicant was asked about this incident during his May 2017 \ncounterintelligence (CI) interview, he gave a completely different account of what \noccurred at the academy, which led to his expulsion. That version lacks credibility. (Tr. \n33-39, 50-51; GE 4-5; AE B) \n \n \nApplicant completed and certified as accurate his SCA in April 2017. In Section \n18, which requires a listing of relatives, Applicant failed to list two additional brothers \nand six additional sisters. Although not alleged in the SOR, he also failed to list his ex-\nwife and two children (I will not consider this evidence for disqualification purposes, but \nI may consider it to weigh Applicant\u2019s credibility, determine the applicability of \nmitigating conditions, and in considering the whole-person factors). Applicant testified \nthat his failure to list his omitted siblings was not intended to deceive the government. I \ndo not find his testimony credible. During a polygraph interview in May 2017, he \nadmitted deliberately withholding this information in order to increase his chances for \nemployment. (Tr. 29, 31, 48; GE 1, 3; AE D) \n \n \nApplicant testified that his father died in February 2019. He admitted that the \nremaining relatives listed in the SOR were in the locations and positions as alleged. His \nbrother employed by the United Nations is still in that position. Applicant\u2019s last contact \nwith him was in February 2019. He has no further information about his brother who is \na colonel in the Djiboutian Army. His last contact with this brother was in 2008. His two \nsisters remain working for the Djiboutian Ministry of Energy. His last contact with them \nwas in February 2019. His sister who was a former Djiboutian congresswoman now \nlives in France. His sister remains the CEO of a cable company. It is a French-owned \ncompany. He cannot recall his last contact with this sister. His brother-in-law is no \nlonger the Djiboutian Ambassador to the United Arab Emirates. He has had no recent \n\n \n4 \n \n \ncontact with him and does not know his current location. His brother-in-law remains the \ncounselor to the Djiboutian Ministry of Transportation. He was also the former CEO of \nthe Djibouti airport. Applicant has no regular contact with him. His last contact with the \nbrother-in-law who was the Djibouti Secretary of Energy was in 2008. (Tr. 39-45; \nAnswer; AE D)  \n \nDjibouti \n \nDjibouti is a republic with a parliament and executive branch led by the \nPresident. Djibouti is strategically located in the Horn of Africa and is a key U.S. partner \non security, regional stability, and humanitarian efforts across the region. (HE II; Note: \nno information was provided concerning Djibouti\u2019s human rights record or potential ties \nto terrorist activities)    \nPolicies \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(a), the entire process is a careful weighing of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record.  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.\u201d  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \n\n \n5 \n \n \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration \nof the possible risk that an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for \naccess to classified or sensitive information). \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the personal conduct security concern: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. \n \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying in this case. The following disqualifying conditions are potentially \napplicable: \n \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts \nfrom any personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or \nsimilar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment \nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine national security \neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities; and \n \n(c) credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is \nnot sufficient for an adverse determination under any other single \nguideline, but which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-\nperson assessment of questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, \nunreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and \nregulations, or other characteristics indicating that the individual may not \nproperly safeguard classified or sensitive information. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s threatening behavior towards a school staffer and fellow student led \nto his expulsion from the police academy, barment from the college campus, and a \ncriminal conviction. This conduct as a whole demonstrates questionable judgment, \n\n \n6 \n \n \nuntrustworthiness, and shows an unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations. \nAG \u00b6 16(c) applies to SOR \u00b6 1.b. \n \n \n \nApplicant deliberately failed to list several brothers and sisters on his SCA. In a \nsubsequent interview with a polygrapher, he admitted intentionally withholding \ninformation in order to secure a job. AG \u00b6 16(a) applies to SOR \u00b6 1.a. \nThe guidelines also include conditions that could mitigate security concerns \narising from personal conduct. I have considered all of the mitigating conditions under \nAG \u00b6 17 and found the following relevant:   \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts;  \n \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior \nis so infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it \nis unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment.; and  \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained \ncounseling to change the behavior or taken other positive steps to \nalleviate the stressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to \nuntrustworthy, unreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such \nbehavior is unlikely to recur.   \n \nAlthough the police academy incident is somewhat removed in time and \nApplicant successfully completed the terms of his sentence, he also minimized his \nculpability in a subsequent statement. This suggests that he failed to take full \nresponsibility for his actions. Applicant also failed to disclose several siblings, his ex-\nwife, and two children on his SCA. He subsequently admitted these nondisclosures \nafter prompting by investigators. Overall, I found Applicant\u2019s testimony on these \nmatters not credible and unreliable. He demonstrated a pattern of untruthfulness and \ndeceit that casts doubt on his reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. None of \nthe mitigating conditions fully apply. \nGuideline B, Foreign Influence \n \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for foreign influence is set out in \nAG \u00b6 7: \n \nForeign contacts and interests, including, but not limited to, business, \nfinancial, and property interests, are a national security concern if they \nresult in divided allegiance. They may also be a national security concern \nif they create circumstances in which the individual may be manipulated \nor induced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government \nin a way inconsistent with U.S. interests or otherwise made vulnerable to \n\n \n7 \n \n \npressure or coercion by any foreign interest. Assessment of foreign \ncontacts and interests should consider the country in which the foreign \ncontact or interest is located, including, but not limited to, considerations \nsuch as whether it is known to target U.S. citizens to obtain classified or \nsensitive information or is associated with a risk of terrorism. \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 7. Two are potentially applicable in this case:   \n \n(a) contact, regardless of method, with a foreign family member, business \nor professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or \nresident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of \nforeign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; and \n \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual's obligation to \nprotect classified or sensitive information or technology and the \nindividual's desire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing \nthat information or technology. \n \nApplicant has two brothers, three sisters, and three brothers-in-law who are \ncitizens and residents of Djibouti, and hold influential positions there. His father died in \nFebruary 2019 and one sister, the former congresswoman, now resides in France. \nThose two relatives no longer create a heightened risk of exploitation. The same \ncannot be said for the remaining relatives listed in the SOR. Though he has not visited \nDjibouti since moving to this country, Applicant has had recent contact with several \nsiblings. AG \u00b6\u00b6 7(a) and 7(b) have been raised by the evidence.   \n \nConditions that could mitigate foreign influence security concerns are provided \nunder AG \u00b6 8:  \n \n(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in \nwhich these persons are located, or the positions or activities of those \npersons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be \nplaced in a position of having to choose between the interests of a foreign \nindividual, group, organization, or government and the interests of the \nUnited States; and \n \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual's sense of \nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, or allegiance to the group, \ngovernment, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such deep \nand longstanding relationships and loyalties in the United States, that the \nindividual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of \nthe U.S. interest.  \n \n\n \n8 \n \n \n \nBased upon the prominent positions several of Applicant\u2019s relatives currently \nhold, or have held, in Djibouti, a situation exists where Applicant could be placed in a \nposition to choose between the interests of his relatives in Djibouti and those of the \nUnited States. Although Applicant has lived in the United States since 2008, he failed \nto produce evidence of substantial ties to this country through his employment, \npurchasing of a residence, or other similar actions. On the contrary, the evidence \nproduced showed that Applicant engaged in criminal behavior, which caused his \nexpulsion from a police academy. As stated above, the protection of the national \nsecurity is the paramount consideration and any doubt must be resolved in favor of \nnational security. I am unable to find either of the mitigating conditions to be fully \napplicable. Despite the presence of some mitigation, it is insufficient to overcome the \nsignificant security concerns that exist.  \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the \nApplicant\u2019s conduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should \nconsider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.  \n \nThe nature of a nation\u2019s government, its relationship with the United States, and \nits human-rights record are relevant in assessing the likelihood that an applicant\u2019s \nassociates are vulnerable to government coercion. Applicant has not overcome the \nvulnerability to pressure, coercion, exploitation, and duress created by his relationship \nto relatives in Djibouti.  \n \n \nI have considered Applicant\u2019s circumstances in immigrating to the United States. \nOn the other hand, I have also considered Applicant\u2019s deceitfulness and false \nstatements on his SCA, as well as his expulsion from a police training program.  \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \n\n \n9 \n \n \nconclude Applicant has not mitigated the personal conduct or the foreign influence \nsecurity concerns.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline E:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \nSubparagraphs   1.a \u2013 1.b:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline B:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \nSubparagraphs   2.a, 2.e:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \nSubparagraphs   2.b - .d, 2.f \u2013 2.i:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances, it is not clearly consistent with the national \ninterest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security clearance.

(Items 4-6)  \n \n \nApplicant visited Afghanistan multiple times since becoming a U.S. citizen in 2007: \nfrom December 2013 to January 2014; June 2014 to July 2014; December 2014 to \nJanuary 2015; March 2015; July 2015; August 2016; June 2017; and August 2017. In \nDecember 2013, Applicant married his wife in Afghanistan. She is an Afghanistan citizen \nand was residing there at the time. (Items 4 and 6) Applicant and his wife had a son born \nin Afghanistan. In 2017, his wife moved to the United States with their young son and she \nbecame a permanent U.S. resident. (Item 3)  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s mother-in-law and father-in-law are citizens and residents of \nAfghanistan. His mother-in-law is a homemaker and his father-in-law is a taxi driver. His \nfather-in-law is also Applicant\u2019s uncle. Applicant has three brothers-in-law. Two are \ncitizens and residents of Afghanistan. One brother-in-law is citizen of Afghanistan and a \npermanent U.S. resident. That brother-in-law previously worked for the Afghan police. \nApplicant has monthly contact with his in-laws residing in Afghanistan. Applicant stayed \nwith his in-laws when he visited Afghanistan. (Item 3, 4, 6)  \n \n\n \n \n \n \n3\n \nApplicant has eight friends and a cousin, who are citizens and residents of \nAfghanistan. He has yearly contact with six friends and quarterly contact with two friends. \nHe contacts his cousin yearly. (Item 5) Applicant said that since his wife has moved to the \nUnited States, he no longer needs to maintain contact with multiple family members or \nfriends in Afghanistan. (Item 3) \n \n \nBased on credit bureau reports (CBR) from May 2017, January 2018, and May \n2018, the SOR alleged six debts that became delinquent between 2014 and 2018, and \ntotaled over $14,503. They included an automobile repossession, three unpaid credit \ncards, an unpaid cell phone bill, and unpaid tuition. (Items 8, 9, 10) \n \n \nIn his Answer, Applicant stated that he is responsible for resolving the alleged \ndebts. He said that he is making payments on the $371 credit card debt. The most recent \nCBR confirmed that the $371 debt listed in SOR \u00b6 1.a had a balance of $143 as of April \n2018. (Item 10). He also stated that he paid the $143 cell phone debt, but there is no \nevidence to confirm that status. Applicant said he intended to pay the other four debts \nwhen he has more money. (Item 3)  \n \n \nAccording to the May 2018 CBR, Applicant has student loans that total about \n$53,350. SOR \u00b6 1.f alleged that one of those loans has a delinquent balance of $2,607. \nApplicant has not made arrangements to make payments on that loan. He makes nominal \npayments of $1 to $3 on several other student loans. (Item 10)  \n \n \nApplicant was employed full-time from October 2015 to January 2016 with a \ntemporary staffing firm. He then obtained a full-time position with a healthcare company. \nHe continues to work for that company while his application for a security clearance is \npending. (Item 6) \n \n \n \nApplicant admitted that he provided $19,400 of financial support to his wife from \n2013 until 2017, before she moved to the United States. Throughout the case file, he \nstated that as a consequence of sending her money and traveling to Afghanistan, he did \nnot have sufficient money to pay the alleged delinquent debts. (Items 3-6) \n \n \nApplicant did not provide a current budget or other information related to his \nfinancial obligations from which to determine his current financial reliability, compliance \nwith payment agreements, or ability to maintain payments on the debts. There is no \nevidence that he has financial investments or other monetary connections in the United \nStates. Applicant asserts that his loyalty is to the United States. (Item 2)   \n \nAfghanistan \n \nI have taken administrative notice of facts contained in U.S. Government \npronouncements concerning the state of Afghanistan. Specifically, Afghanistan faces \nmany challenges fueled by sectarian and ethnic divisions. Numerous terrorist groups are \nincreasingly active throughout Afghanistan. Threats of kidnapping and violence are high, \nand the Department of State warns U.S. citizens that all travel to Afghanistan should be \n\n \n \n \n \n4\navoided. Of particular significance are the poor human rights situation; the active and \nhostile presence of Al Qaida, the Taliban, the Haqqani Network; and other insurgent and \nextremist groups that generate instability and openly attack police, security and military \nforces, the local populace, and U.S. persons and interests. \n.  \nPolicies \n \nThe action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, \nDefense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as \namended (Directive); and the National Security Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining \neligibility for Access to Classified Information or Eligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position \n(AG) effective within the DOD after June 8, 2017. \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for national security eligibility, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines (AG) list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility. \n \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. The entire \nprocess is a conscientious scrutiny of applicable guidelines in the context of a number of \nvariables known as the whole-person concept. The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. I have not drawn inferences based on mere speculation or \nconjecture.  \n \n \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.14 requires the Government to present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d  \n \n \nA person applying for national security eligibility seeks to enter into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants national \n\n \n \n \n \n5\nsecurity eligibility. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the \napplicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as \nto potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified or sensitive information.  \n \n \nFinally, as emphasized in Section 7 of Executive Order 10865, \u201c[a]ny determination \nunder this order adverse to an applicant shall be a determination in terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also Executive Order 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information.) \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline B: Foreign Influence \n \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for foreign influence is set out in AG \n\u00b6 6: \n \nForeign contacts and interests, including, but not limited to, business, \nfinancial, and property interests, are a national security concern if they result \nin divided allegiance. They may also be a national security concern if they \ncreate circumstances in which the individual may be manipulated or induced \nto help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a way \ninconsistent with U.S. interests or otherwise made vulnerable to pressure \nor coercion by any foreign interest. Assessment of foreign contacts and \ninterests should consider the country in which the foreign contact or interest \nis located, including, but not limited to, considerations such as whether it is \nknown to target U.S. citizens to obtain classified or sensitive information or \nis associated with a risk of terrorism. \n \nThe guideline describes conditions that could raise security concerns and may be \ndisqualifying under AG \u00b6 7. Two are potentially applicable in this case:  \n \n(a) contact, regardless of method, with a foreign family member, business \nor professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or \nresident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of \nforeign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; 1  and \n \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual's obligation to \n                                            \n1 The mere possession of close family ties with a person in a foreign country is not, as a matter of \nlaw, disqualifying under Guideline B. However, if only one relative lives in a foreign country and an applicant \nhas contacts with that relative, that factor alone is sufficient to create the potential for foreign influence and \ncould potentially result in the compromise of classified information. See ISCR Case No. 03-02382 at 5 (App. \nBd. Feb. 15, 2006); ISCR Case No. 99-0424 (App. Bd. Feb. 8, 2001). \n \n\n \n \n \n \n6\nprotect classified or sensitive information or technology and the individual's \ndesire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing that \ninformation or technology.  \n \nAfghanistan has significant internal anti-western terrorism threats that operate \nopenly and contrary to U.S. interests. Accordingly, Applicant\u2019s close connections and \nfrequent visits to family and friends there generate  significantly heightened risk of foreign \nexploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion under AG \u00b6 7(a). \n \nApplicant has ongoing connections with his in-laws and friends, who are citizens \nand residents of Afghanistan. He frequently visited those in-laws and provided support to \nhis wife from 2013 until 2017 while she lived there with her parents. These relationships \ncreate a heightened risk of foreign pressure or attempted exploitation because terrorists \nand insurgents in Afghanistan seek intelligence or engage in behaviors that are hostile to \nthe United States\u2019 interests. Applicant\u2019s relationship with family members and friends \ncreates a potential conflict of interest between Applicant\u2019s obligation to protect sensitive \ninformation or technology and his desire to help family members living in Afghanistan. \nThe evidence is sufficient to raise a disqualification under AG \u00b6 7(b).  \n \n  \nAfter the Government produced sufficient evidence of those disqualifying \nconditions, the burden shifted to Applicant to rebut them or otherwise prove mitigation. \nThree mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 8 are potentially applicable to the disqualifying \nsecurity concerns based on these facts: \n \n(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in which \nthese persons are located, or the positions or activities of those persons in \nthat country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be placed in a \nposition of having to choose between the interests of a foreign individual, \ngroup, organization, or government and the interests of the United States;   \n \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of \nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, or allegiance to the group, \ngovernment, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such deep and \nlongstanding relationships and loyalties in the United States, that the \nindividual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the \nU.S. interest; and \n \n(c) contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and \ninfrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign \ninfluence or exploitation. \n \nConsidered in light of the substantial anti-western insurgent and terrorism threats \nin the region, Applicant did not demonstrate that it is unlikely he could be placed in a \nposition of having to choose between the interests of a foreign individual or government \nand those of the United States due to his family ties there. He has perfectly legitimate and \nappropriately close relationships with family members and friends now living in \n\n \n \n \n \n7\nAfghanistan, and a strong interest in protecting those people. His communication and \ncontact with them are neither casual nor infrequent. Accordingly, he failed to establish the \nmitigating conditions set forth in AG \u00b6\u00b6 8(a) and (c). \n \nThe evidence also fails to establish significant mitigation under AG \u00b6 8(b). A key \nfactor in the AG \u00b6 8(b) analysis is Applicant\u2019s \u201cdeep and longstanding relationships and \nloyalties in the United States.\u201d Applicant has some connections to the United States: his \nmother, and two siblings are citizens and residents of the United States; he graduated \nfrom a U.S. high school in 2009; he is currently employed with a U.S. healthcare company; \nand in 2017, his wife and child came to live with him in the United States. However, those \nconnections do not outweigh his strong and recent connections to Afghanistan where he \nspent a significant amount of time between 2013 and 2017, met his wife, married, and \nhad his son. While there, he stayed with his in-laws and saw friends. His father-in-law is \nalso his uncle. There is insufficient evidence to conclude that Applicant\u2019s U.S. ties are so \ndeep and longstanding that he can be expected to resolve any conflict of interests \ninvolving to his family in Afghanistan in favor of the U.S. interests. Accordingly, he did not \nfully mitigate the security concerns raised under this condition. \n \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \n \n \nThe security concerns relating to the guideline for financial considerations are set \nout in AG \u00b6 18, which reads in pertinent part:       \n \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personal security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 19 describes three conditions that could raise security concerns and may be \ndisqualifying in this case:  \n \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; \n \n(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so; and \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations.  \n \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an individual might knowingly \ncompromise classified information in order to raise money. It encompasses concerns \nabout an individual\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting \n\n \n \n \n \n8\nclassified information. An individual who is financially irresponsible may also be \nirresponsible, unconcerned, or negligent in handing and safeguarding classified \ninformation.2 \n \nBased on his admissions and CBRs, Applicant has a history of being unable and \nunwilling to meet financial obligations, which began in 2014 and continues into the \npresent. The evidence raises security concerns under the above disqualifying conditions, \nand shifts the burden to Applicant to rebut, extenuate, or mitigate those concerns.  \n \n \nThe guideline includes conditions in AG \u00b6 20 that could mitigate security concerns \narising from Applicant\u2019s financial problems. Four are potentially applicable: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; and \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \n \nThe delinquent debts alleged in the SOR arose between 2014 and 2018; five of \nthe debts remain unresolved. AG \u00b6 20 (a) does not apply, as his failure to address the \ndelinquent debts over the past years casts doubt on his reliability and judgment. Applicant \nstated that he could not pay his debts after he married in 2013 because he was sending \nhis wife financial support and traveling to Afghanistan to visit her. Both of those \ncircumstances were within his control. He did not provide evidence that he attempted to \nresponsibly manage his financial obligations. AG \u00b6 20(b) does not apply. There is no \nevidence that Applicant participated in credit or financial counseling, and that his \ndelinquent debts are being resolved and under control. AG \u00b6 20(c) does not apply. He \nprovided evidence that he was paying the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.c, establishing mitigation under \nAG \u00b6 20(d) for this debt. He did not submit evidence that he made-good faith efforts to \nrepay or resolve any of the other five debts. AG \u00b6 20(d) does not apply to them.  \n \n \n                                            \n2 See ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \n\n \n \n \n \n9\nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s national security eligibility by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct \nand all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nAccording to AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant national security \neligibility must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the applicable guidelines and the whole-person concept.  \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuidelines B and F in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were \naddressed under those guidelines, but some warrant additional comment. \n \nThe Guideline B security concerns do not arise from any questionable conduct by \nApplicant, but rather circumstances that are normal results of his family situation. There \nis no evidence that he has ever taken any action that could cause potential harm to the \nUnited States. He expressed loyalty to the United States. Although his immediate family \nmembers now live in the United States, he (and presumably his wife) continues to have \nstrong connections to Afghanistan, as demonstrated by his numerous trips there between \n2013 and 2017, and consistent contact with family and friends since then. As a \nconsequence of those relationships, he has chosen not to prioritize the resolution of \nfinancial obligations he incurred in the United States, which establish the security \nconcerns raised under Guideline F.  \n \nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions, and all pertinent facts \nand circumstances in the context of the whole-person, I conclude Applicant failed to \nmitigate the security concerns pertaining to foreign influence and financial considerations. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with substantial questions and doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n\n \n \n \n \n10 \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline B:  \n \n   AGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a through 1.d:   \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline F:  \n \n   AGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.a:   \n                     For Applicant \n \nSubparagraphs 2.b through 2.f: \n  \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant Applicant a security \nclearance. National security eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n                                      \n     \n \n \n \n \n \nSHARI DAM \nAdministrative Judge \n \n \n \n",

Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \n     Statement of the Case \nApplicant submitted a security clearance application (SCA) on May 5, 2017. On \nFebruary 16, 2018, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications Facility (DOD \nCAF) issued Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security concerns under \nGuideline H. The DOD CAF acted under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AGs) implemented by \nDOD on June 8, 2017. \nApplicant timely answered the SOR, admitting all of the SOR allegations. He \nadmitted to using marijuana (MJ) with varying frequency since 2001; using LSD once; \nand hallucinogenic mushrooms twice, as alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b, and 1.c. Applicant \nalso requested a hearing before an administrative judge. The case was assigned to me \non January 3, 2019.

(AE A, attachment 1; Tr. 15) \n \nApplicant was forced to take medical leave from college in 2010 due to a \ndevastating disease diagnosis. (Tr. 22) He required extensive surgery, removal of a large \npart of his intestine, and multiple transfusions. (Tr. 23) He provided a detailed summary \nof his medical conditions and treatments. (AE A, Attachment 4) He is coping with multiple \nlife-threatening illnesses. He also required an ostomy bag (Tr. 26) Consequently, he \nsuffered from anxiety and depression and complex post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) \ndue to what he describes as a lack of adequate coping skills. (Tr. 28)  \n \nApplicant described himself as a socially awkward youth. He smoked marijuana  \nsocially every couple of weeks during high school (HS) due to peer pressure. However, \n                                                          \n1 Unless stated otherwise, the source of the information in this section is Applicant\u2019s May 5, 2017 SCA (GE \n1).  \n \n2 At the hearing, he testified that his last use of medical marijuana was in December 2018. \n \n3 GE 1, pp.  32-33. \n\n3 \n \nhe stopped using it early in HS when his mother caught him in 2003. He resumed using \nMJ in college, but never purchased MJ or sold it. (Tr. 31-32) He used MJ once every two \nor three months in college. (Tr. 57) He stopped using MJ socially once he started working \nfull time after college as it no longer fit his lifestyle and he no longer associated with the \nsame friends. (Tr. 31)  \n \nThe first time Applicant took hallucinogenic mushrooms was in 2010 after his initial \ndiagnosis. (Tr. 32) They were a gift. (Tr. 52) A friend suspected Applicant was depressed \nand offered the mushroom suggesting it would help. The second time was when Applicant \nand his wife took mushrooms that were given to them as a proposed bonding experience. \n(Tr. 33) Neither one liked the effects nor will they ever use mushrooms again. (Tr. 33) \nApplicant also admitted to experimenting with LSD one time in 2016. (Answer, Tr. 33) It \nwas offered to him in a social setting at a Spring festival. (Tr. 34) He did not enjoy it and \nwill never try it, or any other illegal drug, again. He no longer associates with the festival \nattendees. (Tr. 34)  \n \nMost of the pain management surrounding Applicant\u2019s multiple surgeries was \nopiate based. (Tr. 35) He was prescribed medicinal MJ by a physician in April 2017 to \nhelp with stress and aid recovery. MJ was legalized in his state in 2008. (Tr. 60) He \nreceived a medical marijuana card. (AE A, attachment 5, Tr. 35) Applicant testified \ncredibly that the medical MJ helped with his unique medical conditions. (Tr. 36) He last \nused MJ recreationally before he left college in 2014. He believed that his medical MJ \nuse starting in 2017 was legal in his state, and he never shared it with anybody. Now, \nsince receiving the SOR, he understands that the Federal Government considers all MJ \nuse to be illegal. (Tr. 37) Applicant attributes his past drug use to untreated or poorly \nmanaged medical conditions. (Tr. 40) He is taking different medications now.   \n \n \n \nApplicant testified credibly that he informed his current employer about his medical \nMJ use. (Tr. 39) He was hired by a college friend who responded that it was fine so long \nas Applicant had the medical MJ certification. (Tr. 39) He concedes that his MJ use before \n2014 was illegal. (Tr. 52) Applicant stopped using medical MJ in December 2018 after \nenduring two more surgeries in 2017. (Tr. 66) That was about nine months after the SOR \nissued. (Tr. 65) He did not stop using sooner due to confusion about the interplay of \noptions and laws surrounding MJ use. (Tr. 66) \n \nApplicant has never been diagnosed as having a substance-abuse disorder and \nhe did not seek treatment. He has now disassociated from friends who use MJ \nrecreationally. He last used MJ recreationally in 2014, and subsequent use was under \nphysician\u2019s care and for medicinal purposes only.   \n \n \n                                           Policies \n \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially disqualifying \n\n4 \n \nconditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility \nfor access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), \nthe adjudicative process is an examination of a sufficient period and a careful weighing \nof a number of variables of an individual\u2019s life to make an affirmative determination that \nthe individual is an acceptable security risk. This is known as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d \nThe administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the \nperson, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere \nspeculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\u201d  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  Analysis \n \nGuideline H, Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \n \n          The security concern for drug involvement and substance misuse is set out in AG  \n\u00b6 24:   \n \n \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \n\n5 \n \nindividual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior may \nlead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. Controlled substance means any \u201ccontrolled substance\u201d as \ndefined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term adopted in \nthis guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above. \n \n          The guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under AG \n \u00b6 25. The following are potentially applicable in this case:   \n \n \n(a) any substance misuse (see above definition); and \n \n \n(c) illegal possession of a controlled substance, including cultivation, \nprocessing, manufacture, purchase, sale or distribution; or possession of \ndrug paraphernalia. \n \n \n \n           Applicant used MJ on sporadic social occasions while he was in high school and \ncollege. He experimented with mushrooms twice, and LSD once, when these drugs were \ngiven to him over three years ago. He resumed use of MJ, on a medicinal basis, in April \n2017, and ceased medical MJ use in December 2018 once he understood the impact on \nthe security clearance process. The government provided sufficient evidence to establish \nthat the disqualifying conditions above are applicable, and the burden shifts to Applicant \nto show mitigation.  \n \n \n           AG \u00b6 26 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. The following \nare potentially applicable:  \n \n           (a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; and \n \n           (b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and substance \nmisuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and \nhas established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not limited to: \n \n \n     (1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; \n \n     (2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; and \n \n     (3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that any future \ninvolvement or misuse is grounds for revocation of national security \neligibility.  \n \n                                                   \n \n              Applicant\u2019s last recreational use of MJ was over five years ago. He did not use MJ \ncontinuously during the period from 2014-2017. He self-reported and he has \n\n6 \n \ndisassociated from friends who use illegal drugs, and provided a letter of intent to abstain \nin the future acknowledging that any future use will be grounds for revocation of his \nnational security eligibility. He was confused about the laws in his state with respect to \nlegalizing the use of MJ and medicinal use of MJ. There is considerable confusion \nsurrounding the patchwork of state laws around the nation, legalizing MJ.4 \n \n \n \n         Applicant\u2019s recreational use of MJ and experimentation with mushrooms and LSD \nhas been mitigated by the passage of time. He self-disclosed his illegal drug use in his \nMay 2017 SCA. While, it is disturbing that Applicant continued to use medical MJ after he \nreceived the SOR, I am not convinced that he understood that his MJ use conflicted with \nfederal law, until he consulted with counsel. Moreover, Applicant presented a compelling \ncase that his medical conditions affected his physical and mental state, and probably \ncompromised his judgment temporarily. I perceive his voluntary disclosure as candor and \ncooperation. The government would never know about his earlier illegal drug use but for \nhis own disclosures. In any event, he now knows, and he has taken appropriate actions \nto overcome this disqualification including signing a statement of intent to abstain and \ndisassociating from former friends. His conduct does not cast doubt on his reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment. AG \u00b6\u00b6 26(a) and 26(b) apply and his self-reported \ndrug use is mitigated.  \n \n Whole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.  \n       \n                                                          \n4 The Director of National Intelligence (DNI) Memorandum ES 2014-00674, \u201cAdherence to Federal Laws \nProhibiting Marijuana Use,\u201d October 25, 2014, states: Changes to state laws . . . pertaining to marijuana \nuse do not alter the existing National Security Adjudicative Guidelines. . . . An individual\u2019s disregard of \nfederal law pertaining to the use, sale, or manufacture of marijuana remains adjudicatively relevant in \nnational security determinations.  \n\n7 \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline H in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were \naddressed under that guideline. Most importantly, Applicant was candid and cooperative \nthroughout the security clearance process. He has overcome significant adversity. He \nresolved the specific violations alleged in the SOR, and he has unequivocally declared \nhis intention to refrain from further use of illegal drugs.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s drug involvement no longer remains a security concern. These self-\nreported offenses were committed under such unusual circumstances that they are \nunlikely to recur. There is sufficient evidence to conclude that Applicant has \nacknowledged the egregiousness of his drug involvement and taken steps to insure that \nsuch behavior does not recur. He has met his burden of persuasion. The record evidence \nleaves me with no questions or doubts as to Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance. \nFor all these reasons, I conclude Applicant has mitigated the security concerns arising \nunder Guideline H.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline H:  \n      FOR APPLICANT \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a - 1.c:                     For Applicant \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Conclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly \nconsistent with the interests of national security to grant Applicant a security clearance. \nEligibility for access to classified information is granted. \n                        \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \n                                                    Robert J.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant admitted four SOR allegations and denied the remaining three. Her admissions are incorporated into these findings of fact. After a review of the pleadings and evidence, I make the following additional findings of fact. Applicant is a 55-year-old employee of a defense contractor. She recently began working at her present job in approximately November 2018. She was laid off from her previous contractor job and was unemployed from May to October 2018. Before that, she worked for other federal contractors. She is married, but recently separated from her husband. She has four adult children. She has a high school diploma and has taken some college courses.1 The SOR alleged Applicant failed to file her federal and state income tax returns for years 2012 and 2013, and that she had five delinquent collection debts totaling approximately $11,430. Four of the debts are delinquent medical debts and the fifth is a deficiency from a vehicle repossession for a car loan she cosigned with her daughter. She admitted not filing her tax returns during her interview with a defense investigator in March 2017 and during her testimony. The debts were listed in credit reports from May 2016, August 2017, and May 2018 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a \u2013 1.g).2 Applicant credibly explained that she failed to file her tax returns because she experienced a series of medical issues that debilitated her to the point that she thought she had filed those returns when she had not.

Eligibility for \naccess to classified information is granted.  \nStatement of the Case \nOn May 18, 2018, the Department of Defense (DOD) issued Applicant a \nStatement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security concerns under Guideline F, financial \nconsiderations. The DOD acted under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines effective June 8, 2017 \n(AG). \nApplicant answered (Answer) the SOR on June 1, 2018, and she requested a \nhearing before an administrative judge. The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals \n(DOHA) issued a notice of hearing on October 22, 2018, and the hearing was convened \nas scheduled on November 27, 2018. The Government offered exhibits (GE) 1 through \n6, which were admitted into evidence without objection. The Government\u2019s exhibit list \n01/17/2019\n\n \n2 \n \nwas identified as hearing exhibit (HE) I. Applicant testified and offered one exhibit (AE \nA), which was admitted without objection. The record remained open until December \n31, 2018, to allow Applicant to submit documentary evidence. She submitted AE B, \nwhich was admitted without objection. DOHA received the hearing transcript (Tr.) on \nDecember 6, 2018.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant admitted four SOR allegations and denied the remaining three. Her \nadmissions are incorporated into these findings of fact. After a review of the pleadings \nand evidence, I make the following additional findings of fact. \n \n \nApplicant is a 55-year-old employee of a defense contractor. She recently began \nworking at her present job in approximately November 2018. She was laid off from her \nprevious contractor job and was unemployed from May to October 2018. Before that, \nshe worked for other federal contractors. She is married, but recently separated from \nher husband. She has four adult children. She has a high school diploma and has taken \nsome college courses.1  \n \n \nThe SOR alleged Applicant failed to file her federal and state income tax returns \nfor years 2012 and 2013, and that she had five delinquent collection debts totaling \napproximately $11,430. Four of the debts are delinquent medical debts and the fifth is a \ndeficiency from a vehicle repossession for a car loan she cosigned with her daughter. \nShe admitted not filing her tax returns during her interview with a defense investigator in \nMarch 2017 and during her testimony. The debts were listed in credit reports from May \n2016, August 2017, and May 2018 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a \u2013 1.g).2  \n \n \nApplicant credibly explained that she failed to file her tax returns because she \nexperienced a series of medical issues that debilitated her to the point that she thought \nshe had filed those returns when she had not. She was also unemployed during some \nof this time. She explained that she had hip surgery in 2009; back surgery in 2010; foot \nsurgery in 2013; and another back surgery, involving fusion, in 2014. She was heavily \nmedicated after these surgeries, which caused her to lose focus on daily life matters. \nAfter she completed her security clearance application (SCA) in March 2016, she \nreceived correspondence from the IRS indicating that she failed to file her tax returns for \n2012 and 2013. This is when she was first made aware that those returns were not filed. \nApplicant filed her 2012 and 2013 federal tax returns in April 2017. She contacted the \nstate taxing authority to determine what years she needed to file. Because of a \ncommunication breakdown with the state tax authority, she did not file her 2012 and \n2013 state tax returns until March 2018. She paid the required tax due for those years \n(totaling $80) at the same time. She filed all of her federal and state tax returns before \n2012 and has filed them all for tax years 2014 forward.3 \n                                                          \n1 Tr. at 5, 19-21; GE 1. \n \n2 GE 3-6. \n \n3 Tr. at 23, 25-27; Answer; GE 2-3. \n\n \n3 \n \n \nThe status of the delinquent debts listed in the SOR is as follows: \n \n \nRepossession account-$4,626. This is an automobile loan account Applicant \ncosigned with her daughter in 2011. Applicant\u2019s daughter stopped making payments on \nthe debt, and Applicant continued to do so through approximately 2014. Her \nunemployment and medical issues caused her to stop making payments at that time. \nShe has been in contact with the creditor attempting to work out a payment plan.4 \n \n \nFour Medical Accounts-$2,788; $1,822; $2,144; $50. Applicant documented \nthat three of the medical debts were settled and are resolved. Concerning the remaining \ndebt, Applicant provided post-hearing information that she entered into a payment plan \nto make $100 monthly auto payments to the creditor. None of these accounts appear on \nher most recent credit report.5  \n \n \nApplicant testified that her current finances are in good order and that she \ntypically has an $800 monthly surplus after paying all her expenses. She is current on \nher car loan, her camper, and her student loans. Her May 2018 credit report \ncorroborates these assertions.6    \n \n \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(a), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record.  \n                                                          \n4 Tr. at 28-29; GE 6. \n \n5 Tr. at 29-30; Answer; GE 6; AE A-B. \n \n6 Tr. at 35; GE 6. \n \n\n \n4 \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.\u201d  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk that an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nAG & 18 expresses the security concern for financial considerations:  \n \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. I have \nconsidered all of them under AG & 19 and the following potentially apply: \n \n(a) inability to satisfy debts;  \n \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \n\n \n5 \n \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired. \n \n \nApplicant failed to timely file her federal and state tax returns for 2012 and 2013, \nand she accrued several delinquent collection debts. I find all the above disqualifying \nconditions are raised. \n \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns \narising from financial difficulties. I have considered all of the mitigating conditions under \nAG \u00b6 20 and the following potentially apply: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control;  \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax \nauthority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \n \nAlthough Applicant should have responded in a more timely fashion, she has \nresolved her federal and state tax issues. She also addressed her delinquent debts. \nShe missed filing her 2012 and 2013 tax returns when she experienced severe medical \nissues, which caused her to lose track of filing her returns. She also experienced \nperiods of unemployment. These were conditions beyond her control. Given her health \nand employment status, she acted responsibly by filing her tax returns before the \nissuance of the SOR and by addressing her delinquent debts. There are clear \nindications that her financial issues are being resolved and that recurrence is unlikely. \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a), 20(b) - 20(d) are applicable. Applicant filed her 2012 and 2013 federal and \nstate income tax returns and has filed all her succeeding tax returns. AG \u00b6 20(g) \napplies. \n \n\n \n6 \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guideline and the whole-person concept.       \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nrelevant facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 \n2(d) were addressed under that guideline, but some warrant additional comment.  \n \nI considered Applicant\u2019s federal contractor service, and the circumstances \nsurrounding her indebtedness, specifically the medical issues she faced from 2009 \nthrough 2014 and her periods of unemployment. I am convinced she will act in a timely \nmanner with her taxes from now on, and that she will not incur tax problems or \ndelinquent debts in the future.  \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant mitigated the financial considerations security concerns.   \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \nSubparagraphs: 1.a \u2013 1.g:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n7 \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nRobert E.

Crowley, Esquire, Department Counsel \n For Applicant: Leon Schachter, Esquire \n______________ \nDecision \n______________ \nMARSHALL, Jr., Arthur E., Administrative Judge: \n    Statement of the Case \nOn April 2, 2018, the Department of Defense (DOD) issued Applicant a \nStatement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security concerns under Guideline J (Criminal \nConduct) and Guideline E (Personal Conduct). The action was taken under Executive \nOrder 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), \nas amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance \nReview Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative \nguidelines (AG) effective within the DOD on or after June 8, 2017. On June 15, 2018, \nApplicant timely submitted a response in which he requested a hearing before an \nadministrative judge from the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA). I was \nassigned the case on November 8, 2018. DOHA issued a notice of hearing on February \n26, 2019, setting the hearing for March 27, 2019. The hearing was convened as \nscheduled.  \nThe Government offered nine documents as exhibits (Exs.). Applicant objected to \nthe admission of the documents proposed as Exs. 8-9. With the Government in \nagreement, those two exhibits were noted as proffered but not accepted, and the others \naccepted without objection as Exs. 1-7. Applicant offered testimony and eight \ndocuments, which were accepted without objection as Exs. A-H. The transcript (Tr.) was \n08/08/2019\n\n \n \n \n \n2 \nreceived on April 5, 2019, and the record was closed. Based on the exhibits, testimony, \nand record as a whole, I find Applicant mitigated all security concerns.   \n \n     Findings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant is a computer systems analyst who has worked in administration for the \nsame defense contractor for nearly six years. He served for 14 years on active duty in \nthe United States Air Force, reaching the rank of staff sergeant and receiving numerous \nawards and notable performance ratings, and is presently a reservist. Multiple positive \nletters of recommendation were accepted into the record from individuals aware of the \nallegations raised in the SOR. (Tr. 20; Ex. A)  \n \nAt 39-years-old, Applicant supports and lives with his two children, as well as his \nfemale cousin and her two children. He is single. He volunteers within his community by \nassisting at sporting events. At issue in this matter are six allegations raised under \nGuideline J (1.a-1.f) and two allegations raised under Guideline E (2.a-b). \n \n \nIn March 2002, Applicant went out and ordered some take-out food. He and a \ndelivery person, with whom he previously had a disagreement, exchanged words. The \ndelivery person then cursed at Applicant. Applicant went indoors to complain to \nmanagement. Soon, Applicant was confronted by seven individuals from the take-out \nand a fracas arose. Applicant was arrested and charged with simple assault, a \nmisdemeanor, but the matter was dismissed. (Tr. 37-38) This was noted on his July \n2011 e-QIP. \n \n \nIn April 2003, someone was arrested and charged with marijuana possession in \na state near Applicant\u2019s state of residence. That individual was found guilty in absentia \nin July 2003. (see SOR allegation 1.e) Through some confusion, the named individual \nand Applicant have been assumed to be one and the same. Applicant was adamant he \nwas not the individual named in the case. He sought out clarification on the matter, and \nafter fingerprint verification, it was determined that Applicant was not the person \narrested and tried. (Tr. 36; Ex. F-1) Because the charge was in error and subsequently \nresolved, Applicant did not note this incident on his e-QIP. \n \n \nIn around October 2004, Applicant and his now ex-wife had a \u201csituation . . . \nwhere things got a little bit out of hand. We were arguing. She hit me in my nose. I \ngrabbed her by her arms, left some marks on her arm. Police were called.\u201d (Tr. 33) The \nspouses were charged with domestic assault (battery). The matter was ultimately \ndismissed. Based on what he was told during these processes, Applicant was under the \nimpression the matter would be deleted from his record and there would be no need to \nreport the incident on his e-QIP. (Tr. 35)  \n \n \nIn late 2007, Applicant and that same ex-wife were still married. He was fresh \nback from a deployment, the marriage was suffering, and he was relegated to sleeping \non the couch. One day in July 2007, he was awakened to his child screaming. He \ndiscovered his spouse hurting the child. A fight ensued and Applicant shoved his \n\n \n \n \n \n3 \nspouse hard. The police were called and Applicant was arrested for second degree \ndomestic assault in November 2007. This matter was also dismissed. Although there \nwas no conviction, Applicant reported the incident in his July 2011 e-QIP. (Tr. 33; Ex. 1 \nat 34 of 39) Today, the former spouses are \u201cactually, like, best friends. . . .\u201d (Tr. 34) \n \n \nIn January 2010, during a New Year\u2019s Day party, Applicant was mildly intoxicated \nand punch was spilled on his clothes. Applicant borrowed a friend\u2019s jacket to wear, not \nknowing there was a controlled substance (amphetamines) in the pocket. Applicant was \nlater questioned about loitering, and the pills were found by the authorities. He was \ncharged with possession of the drugs. He explained his situation. The possession \ncharge was ultimately dropped in favor of the charge of loitering, a matter he disclosed \nin his 2011 e-QIP, at page 33 of 39, where he referenced the original charge for \npossession of a controlled substance. (Ex. 1 at 32 of 39; Tr. 29-30) \n \n \nIn May 2016, Applicant was with a female friend and his brother after driving to a \nsocial venue. Applicant left his cell phone in the car. As he went back to retrieve it, he \nsaw his brother being attacked and his friend calling his name. (Tr. 23-24) Applicant \ninterceded in the tussle and was eventually arrested for simple assault/robbery, felony \ncriminal charges. He noted the related charges on his more recent 2016 e-QIP at \nSection 22. (Ex. 2 at 35 of 42; Tr. 23-24) The case was ultimately dismissed after his \nbrother\u2019s trial resulted in a not guilty determination. (Tr. 41) \n \n \n \nOn July 26, 2016, Applicant executed an e-QIP (Ex. 2). Although he disclosed \nthe most recent event from May 2016 under e-QIP \u201cSection 22 \u2013 Police Record,\u201d he did \nnot list any of the earlier incidents previously reported on his 2011 e-QIP. This is true \nregarding questions inquiring about whether, in the past seven years, he had been \nissued a summons; been arrested, charged, convicted, or sentenced to a crime; or been \non probation. It is also true with regard to the questions inquiring whether, in his lifetime, \nhe had ever been convicted in any U.S. court of a crime; charged with a felony; \nconvicted of an offense involving domestic violence or crime of violence; or been \ncharged with any offense involving firearms, drugs, or alcohol. Having disclosed all \nincidents in 2011, except for the mistaken charge from 2003 and the 2004 domestic \ndismissal he was led to believe would be expunged and not in need of reporting, \nApplicant limited his disclosures in 2016 to the newest incident from May 2016. He was \nunder the impression that expunged or soon to be expunged charges need not be \nreported. (Tr. 35) Having listed the older incidents before, he had no intention of trying \nto mislead or obfuscate. (see Tr. 39)  \n \n \nSince the last incident, Applicant has successfully completed an anger \nmanagement course. He takes the path of avoidance in the presence of potential \nconflict. He has never been disciplined at work, where he is a valued employee. He was \npleased to receive a promotion two years ago. He has healed his relationship with his \nex-wife, with whom multiple alleged criminal issues arose.  \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n4 \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. They are applied in conjunction \nwith the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto the AG, the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known \nas the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. The AG \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based \non the evidence contained in the record.  \n \nUnder the Directive, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. In addition, an applicant is responsible for \npresenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts \nadmitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel and has the ultimate burden of \npersuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours. The Government reposes a high degree of \ntrust and confidence in those granted access to classified information. Decisions \ninclude, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the applicant may deliberately or \ninadvertently fail to safeguard such information. Decisions shall be in terms of the \nnational interest and do not question the loyalty of an applicant.  \n \nAnalysis \nGuideline J \u2013 Criminal Conduct \n \n \nThe concern raised by criminal conduct is set out in AG \u00b6 30:  \n \nCriminal activity creates doubt about a person's judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person's ability \nor willingness to comply with laws, rules and regulations. \n \nApplicant\u2019s series of multiple arrests and charges are sufficient to establish the \nfollowing disqualifying conditions: \n\n \n \n \n \n5 \nAG \u00b6 31(a): a pattern of minor offenses, any one of which on its own \nwould be unlikely to affect a national security eligibility decision, but which \nin 6 combination cast doubt on the individual's judgment, reliability, or \ntrustworthiness; and  \n \nAG \u00b6 31(b): evidence (including, but not limited to, a credible allegation, \nan admission, and matters of official record) of criminal conduct, \nregardless of whether the individual was formally charged, prosecuted, or \nconvicted.  \n \nThe security concerns raised under this guideline have been mitigated by the following \napplicable factors: \n \nAG \u00b6 32(a): so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior \nhappened, or it happened under such unusual circumstances, that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n \nAG \u00b6 32(c): no reliable evidence to support that the individual committed the \noffense; and  \n \nAG \u00b6 32 (d): there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including, but \nnot limited to, the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, \nrestitution, compliance with the terms of parole or probation, job training or \nhigher education, good employment record, or constructive community \ninvolvement.  \n \nWith one exception, all of the criminal incidents alleged occurred about 10 years \nago and beyond. All of these incidents at issue were ultimately dismissed, except for the \n2003 drug possession charge which was shown to have been waged against him in \nerror. Both spouses were equally engaged in the marital spats, and each related charge \ndismissed without a determination as to fault. As for those charges brought for domestic \nreasons, each appears to have found him in the wrong place at the wrong time or in \notherwise exceptional situations.  \n \nToday, Applicant is older and wiser. Divorce has eliminated tensions between \nApplicant and his ex-wife; indeed, the two are close friends today. He has developed a \ngood work record and garnered high praise from peers. He volunteers within his \ncommunity with local sports. He is helping raise his cousin\u2019s children along with his own. \nThe record as a whole reflects that Applicant has been sufficiently candid with regard to \nthe incidents at issue, both in general and in response to inquiries (see below). In sum, I \nfind Applicant has mitigated criminal conduct security concerns. \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct  \n \n \nThe security concern for personal conduct is set out in AG \u00b6 15: \n\n \n \n \n \n6 \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. Here, Applicant saw charges arising from the incidents noted in the SOR, \ndescribed above, dismissed against him. In addition, he failed to disclose all of the \nincidents at issue in the SOR in his 2016 e-QIP which, if purposefully done to obfuscate \nor falsify, could raise the following disqualifying conditions:  \n \nAG \u00b6 16(a): deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant \nfacts from any personnel security questionnaire, personal history \nstatement, or similar form used to conduct investigations, determine \nemployment qualifications, award benefits or status, determine national \nsecurity eligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities, \nand \n \nAG \u00b6 16(e): personal conduct, or concealment of information about one\u2019s \nconduct, that creates a vulnerability to exploitation, or duress by a foreign \nintelligence entity or other individual or group. Such conduct includes: (1) \nengaging in activities which, if known, could affect the person\u2019s persona, \nprofessional, or community standing. . . .  \n \n \nThis guideline provides seven potential mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 17. Four \nare potentially applicable under these facts: \n \nAG \u00b6 17(c): the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the \nbehavior is so infrequent, or it happened under such unique \ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the \nindividual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \nAG \u00b6 17(d): the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained \ncounseling to change the behavior or taken other positive steps to \nalleviate the stressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to \nuntrustworthy, unreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such \nbehavior is unlikely to recur; \n \nAG \u00b6 16(e): the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate \nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress; and  \n \n AG \u00b6 16(g): association with persons involved in criminal activities was \nunwitting, has ceased, or occurs under circumstances that do not cast \ndoubt upon the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, judgment, or \nwillingness to comply with rules and regulations. \n \n\n \n \n \n \n7 \n \nAs a threshold issue, there is no indication Applicant intended to falsify, \nobfuscate, or mislead when he failed to disclose the dismissed charges noted at SOR \nallegation 1.a-1.e on his 2016 e-QIP. He had adequately disclosed those matters on his \n2011 e-QIP, thus giving investigators sufficient knowledge of the instances to conduct \nan investigation, and limited his answers to the most recent incident from a couple of \nmonths earlier. He knew the earlier instances from 2002-2010 were known. Moreover, \ndespite the wording of the questions, he did not see a reason to repeat their disclosure. \nDuring the hearing, he displayed a weak understanding of expungement and dismissal \nwhich also may have contributed to his failure to answer the question correctly. \nRegardless, while it is clear he failed to note some of the incidents on his 2016 e-QIP, \nthere is insufficient evidence to conclude they were intentionally wrong. Lacking such \nevidence, disqualifying conditions are only raised under this guideline with regard to his \npast criminal charges and dismissals.  \n \nAs for the actions by Applicant that give rise to both criminal and personal \nconduct security concerns, I add my thoughts from the preceding section to this \nguideline discussion. Those incidents not disclosed on the 2016 e-QIP are from 2002-\n2010 and, therefore, far from recent. Half the incidents transpired due to marital stress, \nwhile the other half is comprised of extraordinary incidents from his teens and twenties \n(i.e. pills in a borrowed jacket, misidentification by a court of being a defendant in cased \ntried in absentia, a confrontation with a take-out staff, etc.). None of these types of \nincidents are likely to recur given Applicant\u2019s divorce, his behavior management \ncounseling, and more mature personal focus on his career and activities. Given those \nfactors, I find Applicant raised mitigating concerns AG \u00b6\u00b6 17(c), (d), (e), and (g). \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.   \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the \npotentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and \ncircumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under the two \n\n \n \n \n \n8 \napplicable guidelines in my whole-person analysis. I also considered Applicant\u2019s highly \ncredible testimony, his past military service, divorce, behavioral changes, maturation, \nand current lifestyle. \n \n \nApplicant is now on the cusp of 40 years of age. While charged with criminal \nconduct five times, a sixth charge having been brought incorrectly, Applicant has never \nbeen found guilty or pled either guilty or no contest. Each charge was dismissed. While \nhe was obviously in the wrong place at the wrong time on multiple occasions, there is \ninsufficient reason to conclude that his ill luck or dubious behavior will continue into his \n40s, particularly given his maturation and recent personal accomplishments.

Karoian, Esq., Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: John Martinson, Personal Representative \n______________ \nDecision \n______________ \nCOACHER, Robert E., Administrative Judge: \nApplicant mitigated the security concerns under Guideline B, foreign influence. \nNo disqualifying concerns were established under Guideline C, foreign preference. \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance is granted. \nStatement of the Case \nOn March 23, 2018, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications \nFacility (DOD CAF) issued Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security \nconcerns under Guidelines B and C. The DOD CAF acted under Executive Order (EO) \n10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as \namended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance \nReview Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative \nguidelines implemented on June 8, 2017 (AG). \nApplicant answered (Ans.) the SOR on April 26, 2018, and requested a hearing \nbefore an administrative judge. On September 18, 2018, the case was assigned to me. \n01/31/2019\n\n \n2 \n \n \nOn October 18, 2018, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) notified \nApplicant that the hearing was scheduled for November 28, 2018. I convened the \nhearing as scheduled. Government exhibits (GE) 1 through 4 were admitted in evidence \nwithout objection. The Government\u2019s exhibit list and request for administrative notice \nwere marked as hearing exhibits (HE) I and II. Applicant testified and offered exhibits \n(AE) A through C, which were admitted without objection. DOHA received the transcript \n(Tr.) on December 7, 2018. \n \nProcedural Rulings \n \nI took administrative notice of facts concerning Iraq. Department Counsel \nprovided supporting documents that verify, detail, and provide context for the requested \nfacts. The specific facts noticed are included in the Findings of Fact. \n \nAdministrative or official notice is the appropriate type of notice used for \nadministrative proceedings.1 Usually administrative notice in ISCR proceedings is \naccorded to facts that are either well known or from U.S. Government reports.2  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nIn Applicant\u2019s answer to the SOR, he admitted the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b-1.e, \nwith explanations. He denied the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 2.a. His admissions are \nincorporated into the findings of fact. After a thorough and careful review of the \nevidence, I make the following additional findings of fact. \n \n \nApplicant is 35 years old. He was born in Iraq in 1983. He lived there until he \nimmigrated to the United States in 2008. He became a U.S. citizen in 2013. In 2006, he \nreceived his bachelor\u2019s degree from an Iraqi university. He is employed in the private \nsector, but is pursuing a linguist position with a federal contractor, for which he is \nseeking a security clearance. He has never been married and has no children.3 \n \n \nThe SOR alleged that Applicant\u2019s mother, four brothers and his sister are all \nresidents and citizens of Afghanistan. It further alleged that one brother works for the \nIraqi National Police. The SOR also alleged that Applicant has one friend, who is a \nresident and citizen of Iraq, and who is also currently enlisted in the Iraqi Army; and a \nsecond friend, a resident and citizen of Iraq, who is employed by the Iraqi \nCounterterrorism unit. The SOR alleged that Applicant admitted his allegiance to the \nUnited States and Iraq was divided to about 50 percent to each country. \n                                                          \n1 See ISCR Case No. 05-11292 at 4 n.1 (App. Bd. Apr. 12, 2007); ISCR Case No. 02-24875 at 2 (App. \nBd. Oct. 12, 2006) (citing ISCR Case No. 02-18668 at 3 (App. Bd. Feb. 10, 2004) and McLeod v. \nImmigration and Naturalization Service, 802 F.2d 89, 93 n.4 (3d Cir. 1986). \n \n2 See Stein, Administrative Law, Section 25.01 (Bender & Co. 2006) (listing fifteen types of facts for \nadministrative notice).  \n \n3 Tr. at 20, 22, 65, 78; GE 1. \n \n\n \n3 \n \n \n \nApplicant was hired locally as a linguist from 2004 to 2008 for U.S. forces in Iraq. \nHe provided linguist services at several different locations and for several different \nmissions. In approximately 2005, he began working at a police academy providing \nlinguistic services to U.S. forces who were training Iraqi police candidates. He later \ntransitioned to missions that had him working \u201coutside the wire\u201d providing linguistic \nservices to U.S. forces at roadside checkpoints and providing liaison services between \nU.S. forces and local leaders. His work was hazardous. He experienced frequent rocket \npropelled grenade (RPG) attacks from insurgent forces. In approximately 2007, he \nbegan providing linguistic services at an Iraqi detention facility. At this facility, where \napproximately 20,000 Arabic-speaking detainees were held, Applicant translated \nsensitive written and oral documents for U.S. forces. He was awarded a certificate of \nappreciation from a U.S. Army Military Police Battalion for his work at the detention \nfacility.4 \n \n \nThe current status of Applicant\u2019s relatives listed in the SOR is as follows: \n \n \n1. Applicant\u2019s mother (M). M is 68 years old and in poor health. She immigrated \nto the United States in 2015. She is a legal resident alien in this country (green card \nholder). She lives with Applicant who provides for her. She is currently visiting Iraq. She \nreturned to Iraq in May 2018 to visit her husband\u2019s gravesite (he passed away in \nJanuary 2018). She intended to stay approximately 15 days. She experienced bleeding \nwhile there and was diagnosed with cancer. Currently, she is undergoing chemotherapy \nand unable to travel. She is staying in the house her husband owned presently occupied \nby her sons and daughter. She intends to return to the United States when she is \nhealthy enough to do so. She has no affiliations with the Iraqi government or military.5  \n \n \n2. Applicant\u2019s four brothers and sister (B1-B4, S1). B1 immigrated to this country \nin 2015 with his mother. He is a legal resident alien (green card holder). He lives with \nApplicant and their mother. He works for a private sector employer. He took his mother \nto Iraq in May 2018, but returned alone after 15 days when she experienced medical \nissues. B2 is a resident and citizen of Iraq. He works for the Iraqi National Police as a \ncorrections officer. Applicant has infrequent contact with him, possibly on a quarterly \nbasis through social media. B3 is a resident and citizen of Iraq. He is unemployed. He \nhas no government or military affiliation. Applicant has contact with him approximately \ntwice a year. B4 is a resident and citizen of Iraq. He works in customer service for a \ntelecommunication company. He has no government or military affiliations. Applicant \nhas quarterly contact with him. S1 is a resident and citizen of Iraq. She is a school \nteacher. Applicant has quarterly contact with her. All of Applicant\u2019s siblings were aware \nof his linguist work for U.S. forces from 2004 to 2008. There were no repercussions as a \nresult.6 \n                                                          \n4 Tr. at 23-25, 28-30, 34-35; Ans. (See attachment). \n \n5 Tr. at 59-64; GE 3. \n \n6 Tr. at 43-51; GE 3. \n \n\n \n4 \n \n \n \n3. Applicant\u2019s two friends (F1 and F2). Both F1 and F2 are residents and citizens \nof Iraq. Applicant met them when he was attending college. Applicant\u2019s last contact with \nF1 was in 2016. Applicant knew that F1 was in the Iraqi Army at one time, but now he \nhas no idea as to F1\u2019s status. Applicant\u2019s last contact with F2 was in April 2017. He \nknew that F2 was working for an Iraqi counterterrorism unit. At present, Applicant has \nno idea what F2 does for a living.7 \n \n \nApplicant addressed his apparent statement to a defense investigator in June \n2017 during his background interview. The investigator noted in his report that Applicant \nstated that his allegiance to the two countries was 50 percent each. In March 2018, \nwhen given a chance to review the investigator\u2019s summarized interview, Applicant \nexplained that he meant that he still appreciated the culture, history, and the arts of Iraq, \nhowever, he has no allegiance to the government of Iraq. His undivided allegiance is to \nthe United States as demonstrated by his willingness to put himself in harm\u2019s way while \nworking with U.S. forces in Iraq. During his testimony, he reiterated his allegiance to the \nUnited States, while also explaining that he will always love the history and culture of \nIraq. He documented that his Iraqi passport expired in 2016 and has not been renewed. \nHe has a current U.S. passport that was issued in 2017.8 \n \nCharacter Evidence. \n \n \nApplicant supplied character references from four military commanders \nassociated with his translator duties from 2007 to 2008. All those commanders noted his \ntrustworthiness and other positive character traits that made him a valuable asset. \nAdditionally, the Deputy Task Force Commander, a Marine major general, stated that \nApplicant \u201crisked his life in support of Coalition Forces in Iraq while other interpreters \nhave been kidnapped, killed, or quit. [Applicant\u2019s] dedication, commitment, and support \nto our cause no doubt saved the lives of American soldiers.\u201d9 \n \nAdministrative Notice. \n \n \nThe U.S. State Department warns U.S. citizens against travel to Iraq as travel \nwithin the country remains dangerous. The U.S. Embassy warns that U.S. citizens are at \nhigh risk for kidnapping and violence and to avoid all but essential travel to Iraq. The \nU.S. government considers the potential threat to U.S. government personnel in Iraq to \nbe serious enough to require them to live and work under strict security guidelines. The \nIslamic State of Iraq and Levant (ISIL) remained the greatest terrorist threat globally, \nmaintaining a formidable force in Iraq and Syria.10 \n \n                                                          \n7 Tr. at 51-53; GE 3. \n \n8 Tr. at 54-56; GE 2; AE A-B. \n \n9 Ans. (See attachments). \n \n10 HE II. \n \n\n \n5 \n \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(a), the entire process is a careful weighing of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record.  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.\u201d  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk that an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information).  \n \n \n \n\n \n6 \n \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline B, Foreign Influence \n \n  \nAG \u00b6 6 explains the security concern about \u201cforeign contacts and interests\u201d as \nfollows:  \n \nForeign contacts and interests, including, but not limited to, business, \nfinancial, and property interests, are a national security concern if they \nresult in divided allegiance. They may also be a national security concern \nif they create circumstances in which the individual may be manipulated or \ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a \nway inconsistent with U.S. interests or otherwise made vulnerable to \npressure or coercion by any foreign interest. Assessment of foreign \ncontacts and interests should consider the country in which the foreign \ncontact or interest is located, including, but not limited to, considerations \nsuch as whether it is known to target U.S. citizens to obtain classified or \nsensitive information or is associated with a risk of terrorism. \n \nAG \u00b6 7 indicates conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying in this case: \n(a) contact, regardless of method, with a foreign family member, business \nor professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or \nresident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of \nforeign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion;  \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual's obligation to \nprotect classified or sensitive information or technology and the \nindividual's desire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing \nthat information or technology; and \n(e) shared living quarters with a person or persons, regardless of \ncitizenship status, if that relationship creates a heightened risk of foreign \ninducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion.  \nThe nature of a nation\u2019s government, its relationship with the United States, and \nits human rights record are relevant in assessing the likelihood that an Applicant\u2019s family \nmembers are vulnerable to government coercion or inducement. The risk of coercion, \npersuasion, or duress is significantly greater if the foreign country has an authoritarian \ngovernment, a family member or friend is associated with or dependent upon the \ngovernment, the country is known to conduct intelligence collection operations against \nthe United States, or the foreign country is associated with a risk of terrorism. The \nrelationship between Iraq and the United States places a significant, but not \ninsurmountable burden of persuasion on Applicant to demonstrate that his relationships \n\n \n7 \n \n \nwith his relatives and friends living in Iraq does not pose a security risk. Applicant \nshould not be placed in a position where he might be forced to choose between loyalty \nto the United States and a desire to assist his relatives and friends living in Iraq who \nmight be coerced by governmental entities, or pressured to assist Iraq.  \n \nGuideline B is not limited to countries hostile to the United States. \u201cThe United \nStates has a compelling interest in protecting and safeguarding classified information \nfrom any person, organization, or country that is not authorized to have access to it, \nregardless of whether that person, organization, or country has interests inimical to \nthose of the United States.\u201d11 Furthermore, friendly nations can have profound \ndisagreements with the United States over matters they view as important to their vital \ninterests or national security. Finally, we know friendly nations have engaged in \nespionage against the United States, especially in the economic, scientific, and \ntechnical fields.  \n \nWhile there is no evidence that intelligence operatives from Iraq seek or have \nsought classified or economic information from or through Applicant, his relatives, or his \nfriends living in Iraq, it is not possible to rule out such a possibility in the future. AG \u00b6\u00b6 \n7(a), 7(b), and 7(e) apply based upon Applicant\u2019s family members and two friends who \nare residents and citizens of Iraq, and his mother and B1\u2019s living arrangements with \nhim.  \n \nAG \u00b6 8 lists conditions that could mitigate foreign influence security concerns, \nincluding:  \n \n(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in \nwhich these persons are located, or the positions or activities of those \npersons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be \nplaced in a position of having to choose between the interests of a foreign \nindividual, group, organization, or government and the interests of the \nU.S.;  \n \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual's sense of \nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, or allegiance to the group, \ngovernment, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such deep and \nlongstanding relationships and loyalties in the United States, that the \nindividual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the \nU.S. interest; and  \n \n(c) contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and \ninfrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign \ninfluence or exploitation. \n \n                                                          \n11 ISCR Case No. 02-11570 at 5 (App. Bd. May 19, 2004). \n \n\n \n8 \n \n \nApplicant credibly testified that he has limited contact with his relatives and \nfriends in Iraq. He presented sufficient evidence to establish that it is unlikely that he \nwould be placed in a position to choose between the interest of his relatives and friends \nliving in Iraq and those of the United States. He already has demonstrated that he would \nput the United States\u2019 interests first when he worked as a translator from 2004 to 2008 \nwhile his family members were living in Iraq. AG \u00b6 8(a) applies. \n \nApplicant has met his burden to establish his \u201cdeep and longstanding \nrelationships and loyalties in the U.S.\u201d He worked as a translator from 2004 to 2008 \nperforming different missions for U.S. forces where he earned praise for his loyalty, \nbravery, and trustworthiness while serving in harm\u2019s way. He became a U.S. citizen in \n2013. He currently works and lives in the United States with his mother and B1. The \nevidence supports that Applicant has longstanding ties to the United States and would \nresolve any conflict of interest in favor of the United States. AG \u00b6 8(b) applies. His \ncontact with F1 and F2 is so infrequent, he does not know the current status of either. \nAG \u00b6 8(c) applies. \n \nGuideline C, Foreign Preference \n \n  \nAG \u00b6 9 explains the security concern about \u201cforeign preference\u201d as follows:  \n \nWhen an individual acts in such a way as to indicate a preference for a \nforeign country over the United States, then he or she may provide \ninformation or make decisions that are harmful to the interests of the \nUnited States. Foreign involvement raises concerns about an individual's \njudgment, reliability, and trustworthiness when it is in conflict with U.S. \nnational interests or when the individual acts to conceal it. By itself; the \nfact that a U.S. citizen is also a citizen of another country is not \ndisqualifying without an objective showing of such conflict or attempt at \nconcealment. The same is true for a U.S. citizen's exercise of any right or \nprivilege of foreign citizenship and any action to acquire or obtain \nrecognition of a foreign citizenship. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 10 indicates conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying in this case:  \n \n(f) an act of expatriation from the United States such as declaration of \nintent to renounce U.S. citizenship, whether through words or actions. \n \n \nWhile being questioned by a defense investigator, Applicant was trying to explain \nthat although he was a proud U.S. citizen, a country he risked his life for, he would \nalways have a love for the culture, history, and arts of his native country of Iraq. The \ninvestigator misconstrued Applicant\u2019s explanation as an admission that his allegiance \nwas split 50/50 between the two countries. Applicant credibly denied such was the case. \nApplicant\u2019s actions and words clearly indicate that his preference is toward the United \nStates over Iraq. AG \u00b6\u00b6 9 and 10(f) have not been established. \n\n \n9 \n \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. The circumstances tending to \nsupport granting Applicant\u2019s clearance are more significant than the factors weighing \ntowards denying his clearance. I considered the glowing comments by his commanders, \nwho attested to Applicant\u2019s loyalty and commitment to U.S. forces. I also considered his \nstrong ties to this country as a translator serving in harm\u2019s way while assisting U.S \nforces. He has demonstrated his longstanding loyalty to the United States. Therefore, \nhe provided sufficient evidence to mitigate the security concerns. His actions also \nsupport his assertion that his allegiance is to the United States over Iraq.  \n \nOverall the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude that the security concerns arising under Guideline B, foreign influence, were \nmitigated and that no disqualifying conditions were established under Guideline C.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline B:  \n \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraphs     1.a: - 1.e: \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline C:  \n \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraph       2.a: \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n\n \n10 \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

Smith, Esq., Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro se  \n______________ \nDecision \n______________ \nKILMARTIN, Robert J., Administrative Judge: \nApplicant mitigated the foreign influence security concerns. Eligibility for access \nto classified information is granted.  \nStatement of the Case \nApplicant submitted a security clearance application (SCA) on August 23, 2016. \nOn February 9, 2018, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications Facility \n(DOD CAF) issued Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security concerns \nunder Guideline B, foreign influence. The DOD CAF acted under Executive Order (EO) \n10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as \namended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance \nReview Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative \nguidelines (AGs) implemented by DOD on June 8, 2017. \nApplicant answered the SOR on March 5, 2018, admitting all of the SOR \nallegations with explanations under Guideline B, foreign influence. Applicant also \nrequested a hearing before an administrative judge. The case was assigned to me on \nOctober 19, 2018. The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) notified \n02/14/2019\n\n \n2 \n \nApplicant that the hearing was scheduled for January 24, 2019. I convened the hearing \nas scheduled.  \n \nGovernment Exhibits (GE) 1 - 2 were admitted into evidence without objection. At \nthe hearing, Applicant testified, and he submitted Applicant\u2019s Exhibits (AE) A \u2013 G, which \nwere admitted without objection. I left the record open until February 8, 2019, for \nApplicant to submit supplemental documentation. Applicant timely submitted post-\nhearing documentation including an e-mail dated February 7, 2019, and 15 pages of \ndocumentation showing the conveyances of two properties in Turkey that were owned \nby Applicant and his wife. These were collectively marked as AE H and admitted without \nobjection. DOHA received the transcript (Tr.) on February 5, 2019.  \n \nRequest for Administrative Notice - Turkey \n \nDepartment Counsel submitted a formal request that I take administrative notice \nof certain facts relating to Turkey. The request listed supporting documents to show \ndetail and context for those facts. A risk assessment in this case necessitates \nadministrative notice of facts concerning Turkey.  \n \nApplicant did not object, and I have taken administrative notice of the facts \ncontained in the HE 1 source documents, and incorporated them by reference. The \nfacts are summarized in the written request and will not be repeated in this decision. \nHowever, of particular note, are the following salient facts from HE 1: \n \nNotwithstanding the long strategic U.S. \u2013 Turkey relationship, current country \nconditions are problematic.  The U.S. State Department urges citizens to avoid travel to \nTurkey due to terrorism and arbitrary detentions. Terrorist groups explicitly target \nWestern tourists and expatriates for kidnapping and assassination. The potential for \nterrorist attacks in Turkey, including against U.S. citizens and interests, remains high. \nThe U.S. Government does not allow family members to accompany personnel \nassigned to the U.S. Consulate in Adana, unless they are working in the Consulate. \nTurkey is a transit country for foreign terrorist fighters wishing to join the Islamic State of \nIraq and Syria (ISIS) and other terrorist groups fighting in Syria and Iraq. Since a July \n2016 coup attempt, the Turkish Government has operated under a state of emergency, \nwith far reaching effects on the country\u2019s society and institutions, restricting the exercise \nof many fundamental freedoms. Profound and significant human rights abuses persist.   \n \nFindings of Fact1 \n \n \nApplicant is 48 years old and married. He reports no children. He was born in \nBulgaria and moved to Turkey at age seven. He came to the United States (U.S.) in \n1996 to further his education because Turkey plummeted into chaos. He became a \nnaturalized U.S. citizen in 2011. He earned a bachelor\u2019s degree and a master\u2019s degree \n                                                          \n1 Unless otherwise stated, the basis for these findings of fact is Applicant\u2019s Questionnaire for National \nSecurity Positions (SCA) dated August 23, 2016 (GE 1) and the summary of personal subject interview \nconducted on September 25, 2017. (GE 2) \n \n\n \n3 \n \nbefore emigrating from Turkey. He obtained his Ph.D. in the U.S. in 2000. (GE 1, Tr. 12) \nHe has been employed as a senior engineer by a U.S. corporation since 2000 and he \nhas recently applied for another position with a federal contractor, which approval is \ncontingent on Applicant obtaining a security clearance. (Tr. 60) Applicant provided \ndocuments listing his professional accomplishments, including numerous certificates \nand awards, and 12 U.S. patents in his field of micro-electrical mechanical systems. He \nalso listed his academic accomplishments. (AE A, B, C)  \n \n \nApplicant testified that he or his wife, a naturalized U.S. citizen, owned three real \nestate parcels in Turkey before he became a U.S. citizen. (Tr. 15, 47) His wife \npurchased an apartment in Turkey in 2006 before they were married. She is the sole \nowner. (AE H) He purchased a second property in Turkey in 2008. (Tr. 49) Applicant\u2019s \nwife purchased a third apartment for her totally disabled mother to live close to her \nrelatives in 2012, the year of their marriage. (AE D, Tr. 50) The three real-estate \nholdings alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.d have lost 50\u201360% in value compared to when they were \npurchased, due to the tumultuous conditions in Turkey. (Tr. 15-16) Applicant provided a \ngraph that visually depicts the details of their purchases of real estate in Turkey. (AE D) \nApplicant testified credibly that the exchange rate for Turkish currency (lira) was \nrelatively flat for a long time, but then it lost half of its value on world markets in a five- \nyear span from 2012 to 2017. (Tr. 48) \n \n \nApplicant testified that the property, which he purchased in Turkey in 2008, \nactually was not completely built until 2013, due to chaos in that country. (Tr. 74) \nTherefore, it could not be sold previously. Applicant\u2019s wife became a U.S. citizen in June \n2017. She was a market researcher in Turkey previously and she had no affiliation with \nthe Turkish government. Her mother also has a green card as a permanent resident in \nthe U.S. since 2017. (Tr. 76) Applicant testified credibly that it was extremely difficult to \nsell the real estate in Turkey due to instability, its loss in value, and a saturated market \nfrom overdevelopment around Istanbul. (Tr. 50-51, AE D) He provided supplemental \npost-hearing documents including a deed showing that the real estate he purchased in \n2008 has now been donated or conveyed to his sister under Turkish law. Applicant\u2019s \nwife provided a power of attorney (POA) dated January 28, 2019, to effectuate the sale \nof property purchased for his mother-in-law. (AE H) Applicant\u2019s former Turkish real \nestate interests had a total value of $337,000. (Tr. 58)  \n \n \nApplicant has telephonic contact with his parents once or twice a week. (Tr. 63) \nApplicant contacts his sister living in Turkey only in crisis. (Tr. 66) He had a falling out \nwith his sister because she is angry that Applicant lives so far away, and the care of \ntheir infirm parents falls to her. (Tr. 67-69) Applicant\u2019s 80-year-old father had brain \nsurgery in 2016 and he has not recovered well. (Tr. 30) Applicant testified that the last \ncrisis was when his father fell down and lacerated his scalp and Applicant flew to Turkey \nin September 2018 to assist. (Tr. 69) His father is prone to falling and often injures \nhimself. Applicant has visited Turkey about once a year for the last ten years. (Tr. 69-\n70) Applicant\u2019s 76-year-old mother had a heart attack and subsequent bypass surgery, \nalso in 2012. (Tr. 32) His parents never had any affiliation or employment with the \nTurkish government of intelligence agencies. (Tr. 42) Applicant never sent them \nfinancial aid.   \n\n \n4 \n \n \n \nApplicant owns real estate and other assets in the U.S. as well. He purchased a \nhome in September 2014, for $533,000. His mortgage on that property is down from \n$276,000 to $248,000. (Tr. 56, AE D) Applicant has more than 50% equity in that \nproperty. He also has a $287,000 retirement account; $262,000 savings account in U.S. \nbanks; and approximately $100,000 in publicly traded stocks and bonds. Applicant\u2019s \nU.S. assets, excluding real estate, total over $650,000. (Tr. 61) He has no intent to \nreturn to Turkey, unless it is to visit and help care for his parents in crisis. (Tr. 76, 93) \nApplicant communicates via telephone only with his parents in Turkey, and nobody else. \n(Tr. 81) Applicant testified credibly that the plan is for his parents to leave everything to \nhis sister, when they pass, as she has primarily cared for them. (Tr. 88)  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n   Policies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.  \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \n\n \n5 \n \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \nGuideline B, Foreign Influence \n \n \nThe security concern for foreign influence is set out in AG \u00b6 6: \n \nForeign contacts and interests, including, but not limited to business, \nfinancial, and property interests, are a national security concern if they \nresult in divided allegiance. They may also be a national security concern \nif they create circumstances in which the individual may be manipulated or \ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a \nway that is inconsistent with U.S. interests or otherwise made vulnerable \nto pressure or coercion by any foreign interest. Assessment of foreign \ncontacts and interests should consider the country in which the foreign \ncontact or interest is located, including, but not limited to, such \nconsiderations as whether the foreign country is known to target United \nStates citizens to obtain classified or sensitive information or is associated \nwith a risk of terrorism. \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 7. The following are potentially applicable in this case:   \n \n(a) contact, regardless of method, with a foreign family member, business \nor professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or \nresident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of \nforeign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; \n \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual\u2019s obligation to \nprotect classified or sensitive information or technology and the \nindividual\u2019s desire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing \nthat information or technology; and \n \n(f) substantial business, financial, or property interests in a foreign country, \nor in any foreign owned or foreign-operated business that could subject \nthe individual to a heightened risk of foreign influence or exploitation or \npersonal conflict of interest.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s parents are living in Turkey, but they are in desperately poor health. \nHe regularly communicates with them by phone as a dutiful son. His sister is a citizen \n\n \n6 \n \nand resident of Turkey. He has extremely limited contact with her. He regularly \ncommunicates with no one else in Turkey. He provides occasional care and comfort to \nhis parents during crises. Applicant\u2019s foreign contacts create a potential conflict of \ninterest and a heightened risk of foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, \npressure, and coercion, both directly and through his family members. AG \u00b6\u00b6 7(a) and \n7(b) are implicated by the evidence. Applicant divested himself of his real estate in \nTurkey. AG \u00b6 7(f) is no longer a security concern.  \n \n \nConditions that could potentially mitigate foreign influence security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 8. The following are potentially applicable:  \n \n(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in \nwhich these persons are located, or the positions or activities of those \npersons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be \nplaced in a position of having to choose between the interests of a foreign \nindividual, group, organization, or government and the interests of the \nUnited States;  \n \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of \nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, or allegiance to the group, \ngovernment, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such deep and \nlongstanding relationships and loyalties in the U.S., that the individual can \nbe expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the U.S. interest;  \n \n(c) contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and   \ninfrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign \ninfluence or exploitation; and  \n \n(f) the value or routine nature of the foreign business, financial, or property \ninterests is such that they are unlikely to result in conflict and could not be \nused effectively to influence, manipulate, or pressure the individual.  \n \nApplicant has demonstrated a long-standing preference for working and living in \nthe U.S. since 1996. He earned a doctorate degree from a U.S. institution and he has \nbeen a valuable member of the corporate workforce since 2000. He needs a security \nclearance to enable him to work for a federal contractor in direct support of DOD efforts \nglobally. The value of his U.S. assets eclipses the value of his former real estate \nholdings in Turkey, which he has now transferred to his sister. Although he is presumed \nto have strong bonds of affection with his parents and sibling in Turkey, these bonds are \nnot sufficient to offset or overcome his demonstrated, long-term commitment to the U.S. \nApplicant has effectively rebutted the presumption under all of the circumstances.  \n \n \nI considered the totality of Applicant\u2019s foreign contacts and interests. Guideline B \nis not limited to countries hostile to the United States:  \n \nThe United States has a compelling interest in protecting and \nsafeguarding classified information from any person, organization, or \n\n \n7 \n \ncountry that is not authorized to have access to it, regardless of whether \nthat person, organization, or country has interests inimical to those of the \nUnited States.2  \n \n \nThe distinctions between friendly and unfriendly governments must be made with \ncaution. Relations between nations can shift, sometimes dramatically and unexpectedly. \nFurthermore, friendly nations can have profound disagreements with the U.S. over \nmatters they view as important to their vital interests or national security. Finally, we \nknow friendly nations have engaged in espionage against the United States, especially \nin the economic, scientific, and technical fields. The nature of a nation\u2019s government, its \nrelationship with the U.S., and its human rights record are relevant in assessing whether \nan applicant\u2019s family members are vulnerable to government coercion. The risk of \ncoercion, persuasion, or duress is significantly greater if the foreign country has an \nauthoritarian government, a family member is associated with or dependent upon the \ngovernment, the country is known to conduct intelligence operations against the U.S., or \nthe foreign country is associated with a risk of terrorism.  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s parents and sister are Turkish citizens residing in Turkey, which is an \nunstable regime. His contact with them is limited, as needed, by telephone, and annual \nvisits. There is no indication that they were ever affiliated with the Turkish government \nor intelligence services. Applicant\u2019s foreign family members do not pose an \nunacceptable security risk. There is sufficient evidence to conclude that Applicant would \nreport contacts with his relatives by foreign intelligence agents, and that he has a long-\nterm commitment and exclusive loyalty to the U.S. All of the mitigating conditions in AG \n\u00b6 8 are applicable.  \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.        \n                                                          \n2 ISCR Case No. 02-11570 at 5 (App. Bd. May 19, 2004).  \n \n\n \n8 \n \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments \nunder Guideline B in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were \naddressed under that guideline. Applicant is 48 years old. He is married to a U.S. \ncitizen, educated in the U.S., and owns property here. Virtually all of his adult work life \nwas spent in supporting U.S. interests. He is committed to his profession and life in the \nU.S. His foreign contacts are minimal and he no longer has foreign real estate. He has \nno conflict of interest.    \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with no questions or doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude Applicant  \nmitigated foreign influence security concerns.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n                      Paragraph 1, Guideline B:                         FOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.d:                             For Applicant \n \n \n \n \n \n               Conclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is  \nclearly consistent with the national interest to continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \n \n \n \n \n \n      \n ________________________ \n \n \n \n \n      Robert J.

Eligibility for access to classified information is \ndenied.  \n \n \n \n \n \n Statement of the Case \n \nApplicant submitted security clearance applications (SCA) on December 20, \n2005, and September 19, 2016. On January 31, 2018, the Department of Defense \nConsolidated Adjudications Facility (DOD CAF) issued him a Statement of Reasons \n(SOR) detailing security concerns under Guideline H (Drug Involvement), Guideline E \n(Personal Conduct), and Guideline F (Financial Considerations). The action was taken \nunder Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry \n(February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel \nSecurity Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the \nadjudicative guidelines (AG) effective within the DOD on June 8, 2017.  \n \n    12/17/2018\n\n \n2 \n \n \n \nApplicant answered the SOR on March 27, 2018, and elected to have his case \ndecided on the written record. He did not submit any documentation with his Answer. \nOn July 11, 2018, Department Counsel submitted the Government\u2019s file of relevant \nmaterial (FORM). Applicant received it on July 17, 2018. The FORM notified Applicant \nthat he had an opportunity to file objections and submit material in refutation, \nextenuation, or mitigation within 30 days of his receipt of the FORM. The Government\u2019s \nevidence is identified as Items 1 through 9. Applicant did not provide a response to the \nFORM, object to the Government\u2019s evidence, or submit documents. The Government\u2019s \nevidence is admitted. The case was assigned to me on October 16, 2018.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nAfter a thorough and careful review of the pleadings and exhibits submitted, I \nmake the following findings of fact. \n \n \nApplicant is 49 years old. He has been employed by his present employer, a \nfederal contractor, since 2005. He earned a bachelor\u2019s of science in business \nmanagement in October 2004. He has been married since 2000 and has two children, \nages 18 and 15. He enlisted in the U.S. Air Force in March 1988. In June 1991, he \nreceived a general discharge due to his marijuana use while in the military. (Items 4, 5) \n \n \nApplicant was interviewed in September 2017 by an authorized DOD investigator \nfor his background security clearance investigation. He told the investigator that he \nbegan using marijuana in 1986 while he was in high school. He admitted using \nmarijuana on approximately three occasions while he was in the military. Since his \ndischarge from the military in 1991, he admitted that he continued to smoke marijuana \non a monthly basis to the present time. Prior to October 2015, Applicant would purchase \nmarijuana from an individual\u2019s home. Since October 2015, he obtained a medical \nmarijuana card and now purchases his marijuana from the dispensary, since it is legal \nto do so in his state. Applicant admitted he falsified his drug answers on the SCA \nbecause he was afraid the information would have an adverse impact on his security \nclearance. Applicant stated that he no longer plans to use marijuana because he now \nhas no desire to use it. (Item 9) \n \n \nOn the 2005 SCA, Applicant only disclosed marijuana use in March 1990. He \nintentionally failed to disclose his current use of marijuana, and that he used cocaine in \nat least 2000. Applicant voluntarily entered treatment in 2000 due to his use of cocaine, \nbut he did not disclose that information either. On the 2016 SCA, Applicant disclosed \nthat he used marijuana in the military, and he disclosed his voluntary treatment in 2000 \nfor his use of cocaine. Applicant intentionally failed to disclose his current use of \nmarijuana, to include after he was granted a DOD security clearance in January 2007. \n(Items 4, 5) \n \n \nThe DOD investigator also questioned Applicant about the delinquent accounts \nhe listed on his 2016 SCA. Applicant stated that beginning in about December 2010, he \ncould no longer afford to make regular payments on these financial accounts after his \n\n \n3 \n \n \nspouse had her hours reduced by her employer. Applicant admitted that he has not paid \nany of his delinquent creditors. He was currently doing research into the possibility of \nconsolidating his delinquent debt, but he had not yet taken any action to do so. (Item 9) \n \nDrug Involvement \n \n  \nSOR \u00b6 1.a alleges that while Applicant was on active duty in the U.S. Air Force, \nand after being granted a DOD security clearance, he used marijuana between August \n1990 and June 1991. Applicant admitted this allegation in his SOR response. (Items 1, \n3) \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.b alleges that Applicant tested positive for marijuana while on active \nduty in April 1991. He received non-judicial punishment and the U.S. Air Force gave \nApplicant a general, under honorable conditions discharge (misconduct \u2013 drug use), in \nJune 1991. Applicant admitted this allegation in his SOR response. (Items 1, 3) \n \n \nThe third SOR allegation (\u00b6 1.c) alleges that Applicant continued to use and \npurchase marijuana from June 1991 to at least September 2017, to include after he had \nbeen granted a DOD security clearance in January 2007. Applicant admitted this \nallegation in his SOR response. (Items 1, 3) \n \nPersonal Conduct \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 2.a alleges that Applicant falsified his 2016 SCA by intentionally failing to \ndisclose that he had used marijuana within the last seven years, and he deliberately \nfailed to divulge he had continued to use marijuana after he had been granted a DOD \nsecurity clearance in January 2007. Applicant admitted this allegation in his SOR \nresponse. (Items 1, 3) \n \n \nThe second SOR allegation (\u00b6 2.b) alleges that Applicant deliberately failed to \ndisclose on his 2005 SCA that he had used marijuana within the last seven years, and \nthat he had also used cocaine in at least 2000. Applicant admitted this allegation in his \nSOR response. (Items 1, 3) \n \nFinancial Considerations \n \n \nThe SOR alleges that Applicant is indebted on six delinquent accounts in the \ntotal approximate amount of $24,292. (Items 1, 6-8) \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 3.a alleges that Applicant is indebted on a credit card account that has \nbeen placed for collection in the approximate amount of $8,708.00. As of January 2018, \nthe account remained delinquent. Applicant admitted this allegation in his SOR \nresponse. (Items 1, 3) \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 3.b alleges that Applicant is indebted on a credit card account that has \nbeen charged off in the approximate amount of $4,898.00. As of January 2018, the \n\n \n4 \n \n \naccount remained delinquent. Applicant admitted this allegation in his SOR response. \n(Items 1, 3) \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 3.c alleges that Applicant is indebted on a credit card account that has \nbeen placed for collection in the approximate amount of $4,283.00. As of January 2018, \nthe account remained delinquent. Applicant admitted this allegation in his SOR \nresponse. (Items 1, 3) \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 3.d alleges that Applicant is indebted on a credit card account that has \nbeen placed for collection in the approximate amount of $4,172.00. As of January 2018, \nthe account remained delinquent. Applicant admitted this allegation in his SOR \nresponse. (Items 1, 3) \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 3.e alleges that Applicant is indebted on a credit card account that has \nbeen charged off in the approximate amount of $2,041.00. As of January 2018, the \naccount remained delinquent. Applicant admitted this allegation in his SOR response. \n(Items 1, 3) \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 3.f alleges that Applicant is indebted for a utility service account that has \nbeen placed for collection in the approximate amount of $190.00. As of January 2018, \nthe account remained delinquent. Applicant admitted this allegation in his SOR \nresponse. (Items 1, 3) \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the AG. In addition to brief introductory explanations \nfor each guideline, the AG list potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating \nconditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified \ninformation. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n\n \n5 \n \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 an \u201capplicant is responsible \nfor presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate \nfacts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the ultimate \nburden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\u201d  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk that an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline H: Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \n \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse is set out in AG \u00b6 24:  \n \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior \nmay lead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations.  \n \n \nAG \u00b6 25 provides conditions that could raise security concerns. The following is \npotentially applicable:  \n \n(a) any substance misuse;  \n \n(b) testing positive for an illegal drug; \n \n\n \n6 \n \n \n(c) illegal possession of a controlled substance, including cultivation, \nprocessing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of \ndrug paraphernalia; and \n \n(f) any illegal drug use while granted access to classified information or \nholding a sensitive position. \n \n \nApplicant used and purchased marijuana beginning in 1986 until September \n2017, including while he in the military and after having been granted a DOD security \nclearance in January 2007. The above disqualifying conditions apply.  \n \n \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns \narising from drug involvement. The following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 26 are \npotentially applicable: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \nand \n \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, provides evidence of actions to overcome the problem, \nand has established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not limited to: \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; (2) changing \nor avoiding the environment where drugs were being used; and (3) \nproviding a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug involvement \nand substance misuse, acknowledging that any future involvement or \nmisuse is grounds for revocation of national security eligibility; and \n \n(d) satisfactory completion of a prescribed drug treatment program, \nincluding, but not limited to, rehabilitation and aftercare requirements, \nwithout recurrence of abuse, and a favorable prognosis by a duly qualified \nmedical professional. \n \n \nApplicant used marijuana for 31 years, ending in September 2017. Applicant has \nnot submitted any evidence of his abstinence from using marijuana. Although \nApplicant\u2019s recent use of marijuana was permitted under state law, such conduct \nnonetheless violated Federal law and DOD policies.1 There is no documentation that \nApplicant has completed, or is currently involved in, a recognized substance abuse \ntreatment program. Mitigating conditions AG \u00b6 26(a), (b) and (d) do not apply.  \n \n \n \n                                                          \n1 The Director of National Intelligence reaffirmed that the disregard of federal law concerning use, sale, or \nmanufacture of marijuana is relevant in national security determinations regardless of changes to state laws \nconcerning marijuana use in a memorandum dated October 24, 2014. \n\n \n7 \n \n \nGuideline E: Personal Conduct \n \n \nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the security concern for personal conduct:  \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during the national \nsecurity investigative or adjudicative processes. . . . \n \n \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. I find the following potentially applicable:  \n \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or \nsimilar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment \nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine national security \neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities. \n \n \nApplicant deliberately failed to disclose his illegal drug use on an SCA he \ncompleted in 2005, and on another SCA he completed in 2016. The above disqualifying \ncondition applies. \n \n \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns \narising from personal conduct. I have considered the following mitigating conditions \nunder AG \u00b6 17:  \n \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; and \n \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment. \n \n \nApplicant knew that he was required to list his illegal drug history on his SCAs. \nHe did not make prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the falsifications on his 2005 SCA \nand 2016 SCA. He eventually disclosed his marijuana use during his September 2017 \nbackground interview, but over a year had passed since the submission of his falsified \n2016 SCA. Applicant admitted to the DOD investigator that he did not want to disclose \nhis adverse illegal drug use information on the SCA due to the possible negative \nconsequences to his DOD security clearance. Applicant\u2019s deliberate omissions \ndemonstrate a pattern of deception, and his conduct casts doubt on his reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and good judgment. There is insufficient evidence to apply mitigating \nconditions AG \u00b6\u00b6 17(a), and (c). \n\n \n8 \n \n \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \n \n \nAG \u00b6 18 articulates the security concern for financial problems: \n \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. . . .  \n \n \nAG \u00b6 19 includes two disqualifying conditions that could raise a security concern \nand may be disqualifying in this case: \u201c(a) inability to satisfy debts\u201d; and \u201c(c) a history of \nnot meeting financial obligations.\u201d The evidence established AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a), and 19(c). \nFurther inquiry about the applicability of mitigating conditions is required. \n \n \n \nFive financial considerations mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially \napplicable:  \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control;  \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \n\n \n9 \n \n \n  \n \nApplicant failed to provide any documentary evidence of payments, payment \narrangements, or other debt-resolution efforts. Similarly, he provided no documentary \nevidence demonstrating financial responsibility and good judgment. None of the \nmitigating conditions apply. Financial considerations security concerns are not \nmitigated.   \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.  \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments \nunder Guidelines H, E, and F in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 \n2(d) were addressed under that guideline, but some warrant additional comment. \n \nApplicant is 49 years old and has worked for his current employer since January \n2005. He was issued a DOD security clearance in January 2007. In light of his lengthy \ndrug history, Applicant\u2019s recent decision to abstain from marijuana does not mitigate the \ndrug involvement and substance misuse security concerns. Applicant\u2019s repeated \nfalsifications cast serious doubt on his trustworthiness and judgment. There is no \ndocumentary efforts showing that Applicant has acted responsibly in addressing his \ndelinquent debts. For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant failed to mitigate the \nsecurity concerns arising under Guideline H (Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse), \nGuideline E (Personal Conduct), and Guideline F (Financial Considerations). \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n10 \n \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline H:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.c: \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 2.a-2.b: \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nParagraph 3, Guideline F:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 3.a-3.f: \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national security to grant Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security \nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n \n \n                                            \n \n \n \nPAMELA C. BENSON \nAdministrative Judge \n",

    "summary": "Findings of Fact In his answer to the SOR, Applicant admits to the allegations. Applicant is a 49-year-old senior-level employee for a DOD contractor who seeks a security clearance. He has been employed with the DOD contractor since June 2013. He has held a top secret security clearance since 2008. He has a bachelor\u2019s degree and has also attended executive-education courses. He is married and has three children. Two are in college and the youngest is in high school. (Tr.17-22, 34, 53; Gov 1) (Note: The facts in this decision do not specifically describe employment, names of witnesses, or locations in order to protect Applicant and his family\u2019s privacy. The cited sources contain more specific information.) Under the drug involvement concern, the SOR alleged Applicant used marijuana in February 2014 and in January 2016 after being granted a security clearance in 2008.

Glassman, Esquire \n______________ \nDecision \n______________ \nHOGAN, Erin C., Administrative Judge: \nApplicant submitted an application for a security clearance (e-QIP) on February \n23, 2017. On February 28, 2018, the Department of Defense Consolidated \nAdjudications Facility (DOD CAF) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant \ndetailing the security concerns under Guideline H, Drug Involvement; and Guideline E, \nPersonal Conduct. The action was taken under Executive Order (EO) 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; \nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security \nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the \nadjudicative guidelines (AG) implemented within the Department of Defense on June 8, \n2017.  \nOn April 3, 2018, Applicant answered the SOR and requested a hearing before \nan administrative judge. Department Counsel was ready to proceed on May 10, 2018. \nAnother administrative judge was assigned the case on August 9, 2018.  On September \n21, 2018, a Notice of Hearing was issued, scheduling the hearing on October 25, 2018. \nThe case was transferred to me on October 10, 2018, because of the unavailability of \nthe assigned administrative judge. The hearing was held as scheduled. During the \nhearing, the Government offered five exhibits which were admitted as Government \n(Gov) Exhibits 1 - 5. Applicant testified, called one witness, and offered one exhibit \nwhich is admitted as Applicant Exhibit (AE) A (consisting of a green notebook containing \n01/24/2019\n\n2 \n \na brief from Applicant\u2019s counsel and five attached exhibits), without objection. The \ntranscript was received on November 2, 2018. Based upon a review of the case file, \npleadings, and exhibits, eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn his answer to the SOR, Applicant admits to the allegations.    \n \nApplicant is a 49-year-old senior-level employee for a DOD contractor who seeks \na security clearance. He has been employed with the DOD contractor since June 2013. \nHe has held a top secret security clearance since 2008. He has a bachelor\u2019s degree \nand has also attended executive-education courses. He is married and has three \nchildren. Two are in college and the youngest is in high school. (Tr.17-22, 34, 53; Gov \n1) (Note: The facts in this decision do not specifically describe employment, names of \nwitnesses, or locations in order to protect Applicant and his family\u2019s privacy. The cited \nsources contain more specific information.)  \n \nUnder the drug involvement concern, the SOR alleged Applicant used marijuana \nin February 2014 and in January 2016 after being granted a security clearance in 2008.  \nThe same conduct is cross-alleged under the personal conduct concern. In his \nresponse to the SOR, Applicant admits the allegations, but states he did not believe he \nwas committing a crime because marijuana use occurred in a state where marijuana \nuse is legal. (Response to SOR, dated April 3, 2018)  \n \nOn September 25, 2014, Applicant submitted an electronic questionnaire for \ninvestigations processing (e-QIP) for a periodic reinvestigation.  In response to Section \n23 \u2013 Illegal Use of Drugs or Drug Activity, Applicant listed that he used marijuana once \non vacation. He believed marijuana was legal in the state where he used it. Applicant \nindicated on his e-QIP application that \u201cIt was legal in [state redacted], or so I thought at \nthe time.\u201d (Gov 2, section 23)  \n \nOn August 29, 2014, Applicant submitted a Standard Form 86 (SF 86), seeking \nto upgrade his security clearance for access to sensitive compartmented information \n(SCI). His sponsor was another government agency who sponsored him for his work as \na contractor with the agency. In response to questions regarding illegal drug use, he \nlisted marijuana use in January 2013 in a state where marijuana use was legal and \nmarijuana use in June 2014 with his former college roommate. The location as to where \nthe use occurred in June 2014 was cut off on the SF 86. (Item 5 b) The January 2013 \nand June 2014 marijuana usage was not alleged in the SOR.  As such, it will not be \nconsidered under the disqualifying factors, but will be considered when applying matters \nof extenuation and mitigation.   \n \nAs part of processing for SCI access, the other government agency had \nApplicant execute a Personnel Security Policy Advisory on August 29, 2014, which \nstates: \n \nAs a condition of receiving or retaining security clearance with [other \ngovernment agency], you are required to adhere to various personnel \n\n3 \n \nsecurity policies. These policies are in effect to provide NSA affiliates from \nbeing targets of espionage and other hostile activities carried out by or on \nbehalf of foreign intelligence entities.\u201d The policies included: \n \nImproper Use of Drugs \u2013 The improper usage of drugs by [other \ngovernment \nagency \naffiliates] \n(e.g., \n[other \ngovernment \nagency] \nemployees, \nmilitary \nassignees \nor \nrepresentatives, \ncontractors, \nconsultants, and experts) and applicants is strictly prohibited. Improper \nuse includes the illegal use of controlled substances as will as the use, \ntransfer, possession, sale or purchase of any drug for purposes other than \ntheir intended medical use. . . .  \n \nFailure to observe the policies summarized above may constitute grounds \nfor disqualification from initial or continued access to [other government \nagency] information and facilities. Your signature below indicates your \nunderstanding and willingness to comply with these policies. \n \nWhile the actual statement signed by Applicant is not in the record, the \nClearance Decision statement of the other government agency indicates he signed the \nstatement on August 29, 2014.  (Gov 5a)   \n  \nApplicant was interviewed by an investigator conducting a background \ninvestigation on June 12, 2015. I considered the summary of the interview, but gave it \nless weight because it is unsworn and unauthenticated. (See Directive, enclosure 3, \npara 1.20) Applicant\u2019s 2014 marijuana use was discussed during the interview.  The \ninvestigator\u2019s summary of the interview states that Applicant had no desire to try \nmarijuana again because he now realizes marijuana use remains illegal under federal \nlaw. (Gov 4)  Applicant did not recall this interview or making the above statement. He \nconceded under cross-examination that if it was in the statement he probably said it. \n(Tr. 59)  \n \nOn January 11, 2016, Applicant underwent a counterintelligence polygraph. \nDuring the pre-polygraph interview, Applicant told the polygrapher that he used \nmarijuana in 2014 and 2016 while on vacation in a state where marijuana use was legal.  \nHis most recent use of marijuana occurred about two weeks before the polygraph. He \nbelieved that it was okay to use marijuana because it was legal in the state where he \nused it. The polygrapher told him that the use of marijuana was not okay because \nmarijuana use was still illegal under federal law. Applicant claimed that he was not \naware of this until he was so advised by the polygrapher. Applicant testified the \npolygrapher told him something to the effect that they would not be having this \nconversation a year from now, implying that marijuana may become legal nationwide. \n(Tr. 35-36; Gov 3 at 9-10 )  \n \nThe polygrapher asked Applicant if he intended to use marijuana in the future.  \nApplicant responded, \u201cI don\u2019t know that I\u2019d never use it again.\u201d Applicant testified he \nintended to be honest and meant that he might possibly use marijuana again if it \nbecame legal under federal law or if he retired and traveled to a place where marijuana \nis legal. He stressed that he had no intentions of using marijuana while possessing a \n\n4 \n \nsecurity clearance and while working for the U.S. government. He believes the \npolygrapher mischaracterized his answer. (Tr. 38-39, 60-61; Gov 3 at 10)  \n \nThe polygrapher summarized the interview as follows: \n \n[Applicant] reported that from approximately January 2013 to January \n2016, he smoked marijuana approximately twice a year. In each instance, \nhe was given marijuana free of charge from a friend. He reported that the \nlast time he smoked marijuana was \u201cthis past Thursday,\u201d which was 7 \nJanuary 2016. He reported that he had an active security clearance at the \ntime. [Applicant] initially reported that he is likely to smoke marijuana again \nin the future; however, when asked if he would cease smoking the \nsubstance as a condition of employment, he stated, \u201cyes.\u201d  (Gov 5a at 2)   \n \nApplicant disputed the polygrapher\u2019s assertion that he used marijuana \napproximately twice a year from 2013 to January 2014.  Applicant testified there were a \nnumber of statements reflected in the report that were not factual or were taken out of \ncontext. (Tr. 59-61) On October 17, 2016, the other government agency denied \nApplicant access to SCI. (Gov 5a)  \n   \nOn February 23, 2017, Applicant submitted an e-QIP. He listed that he used \nmarijuana on two occasions in February 2014 and January 2016. On both occasions, he \nwas on vacation with friends. Marijuana use was legal in the state where he vacationed \nwith friends. Applicant later indicated in response to the question regarding future use \u201cI \nnow understand that was in violation of a federal statute by doing so.\u201d (Gov 1, section \n23) \n \nIn response to Section 25 \u2013 Investigations and Clearance Record on the same e-\nQIP application, Applicant answered \u201cYes\u201d in response to \u201cHave you EVER had a \nsecurity clearance eligibility/access authorization denied, suspended, or revoked?\u201d  He \nexplained: \n \nI smoked marijuana in a state where it was considered legal, while not \nrealizing that I was violating the terms of my clearance given the federal \nnature of the action. I made it clear that if my employment status was \ncontingent upon not smoking marijuana I would refrain. I have also \ncompletely refrained (January 2016) since I became aware that I violated \nthe terms of my clearance.  \n \n(Gov 1, section 25)  \n  \nApplicant has not used marijuana since January 2016.  He is not a habitual user. \nHe claims all marijuana use occurred with friends while on vacation in a state where \nmarijuana was legalized in 2013. He provided a statement on October 25, 2018, \nindicating that he does not intend to use marijuana in the future and is aware that any \nfuture involvement or misuse is grounds for revocation of national security eligibility.  \n(Tr. 39; AE A, exhibit 3)  \n \n\n5 \n \nApplicant no longer attends his friends\u2019 annual vacation. He avoids situations \nwhere friends may use marijuana. Applicant testified that he was not addicted to \nmarijuana. His marijuana usage never created problems in his life. He believed it was \nlegal to use marijuana in the state where he was on holiday and only partook in the \nmarijuana that was being passed around at the house where he and his friends were \nstaying before they went out to dinner. If he was informed that marijuana use remained \nillegal under federal law, he would not have used it.  (Tr. 36-37, 42-45, 71 ) \n \nWhen asked why he was surprised to learn that marijuana was illegal under \nfederal law in his 2017 background investigation, Applicant testified: \n \nThere are - - you hear constant stories in the media about what is and is \nnot legal, factual. There is so much conflicting information. And by the \nway, as my OPM investigator said to me, there is so much conflicting \ninformation out there that there is not a clear story as to what\u2019s legal, \nwhat\u2019s not, and as with any element of life, things constantly evolve and \nchange. And, as I understood, that is the case.  (Tr. 62-63)  \n \nApplicant is remorseful about his marijuana use. He would never have used \nmarijuana had he known the seriousness of his actions. He does not believe any of his \nfriends would pressure him to use marijuana again. His family, several of his closest \nfriends, and some of his colleagues at work are aware of his past marijuana use. His \nmarijuana use cannot be used to blackmail him. (Tr. 36, 49-50; AE 3 at 10)  \n \nThe Facility Security Officer (FSO) of Applicant\u2019s employer (FSO A) testified \nduring the hearing. He is a vice-president of administration and also serves as the FSO \nas an additional duty. The company has 21 people who have or need security \nclearances. In 2015, he trained to be an FSO by taking online training offered by the \nCenter for Defense Security Excellence. During the online self-paced training, FSO A \nclaims there was no discussion about the use of marijuana and the impact on security \nclearances. He never told Applicant about the adverse consequences of using \nmarijuana while possessing a security clearance. (Tr. 72-77)  \n \nFSO A claimed he only learned there was an issue about using marijuana while \npossessing a security clearance after Applicant told him about it after his background \ninvestigation interview. The Defense Security Service (DSS) sends out monthly e-mails \nabout high-level facility security updates and changes in policy. FSO A cannot recall any \nof the e-mails containing information about the use of marijuana while possessing a \nsecurity clearance. (Tr. 73-77)   \n \n \nFSO A is familiar with the SF 86.  He is aware that the questionnaire contains \nquestions regarding illegal drug use. If an employee came to him and told him of their \nmarijuana use, he would file an incident report. He testified he is required to report the \nuse because marijuana remains illegal at the federal level. He is aware of that the policy \nregarding marijuana use has not changed. He never told Applicant or employees of the  \ncompany that it was okay to use marijuana. He is aware of the statutory law on a federal \ndrug-free workplace. He is aware that employees are subject to urinalysis. Applicant \nnever came to him to inquire about the use of marijuana, how it relates to federal law, or \n\n6 \n \nthe affect it would have on his security clearance. He does not recall if he received any \nupdates on DoD policy regarding the state legalizations of marijuana and how it affects \nfederal law.  (Tr. 78-86)     \n \nWhole-Person Factors \n \n \nMr. M. met Applicant through a young leader\u2019s business association. Applicant \nhas been the leader of the organization over the past five years. Mr. M. is the president \nof a $6 billion privately-held company and holds a top secret security clearance. He \nbelieves Applicant is worthy of holding a security clearance because of the tremendous \nvalue his company provides to the U.S. government. If his privileged access is removed, \nit would be harmful to his business and its over 130 employees.  He strongly \nrecommends Applicant be allowed to maintain a security clearance. (AE A, exhibit 4)  \n \nMr. A. is a long-time friend, neighbor and associate of Applicant\u2019s. He describes \nApplicant as \u201can astute and responsible professional\u201d and a wonderful father and \nhusband. They have been neighbors for seven years. They attend the same church, \nhealth club as well as social events. Applicant\u2019s reputation is \u201cimpeccable.\u201d He is highly \nregarded in the community. He describes Applicant as a loyal U.S. citizen who \npossesses the necessary judgment to be trusted with matters of national security. He is \na man of high integrity and good moral character. (AE A, exhibit 5)  \n \nNumerous business colleagues of Applicant provided favorable comments about \nApplicant on his Linkedin page. (AE A, exhibit 1)  \n  \n \nDOD and Federal Government Policy on Marijuana Use  \n \n  \nOn October 25, 2014, the Director for National Intelligence, issued a \nmemorandum titled, \u201cAdherence to Federal Laws Prohibiting Marijuana Use\u201d addressing \nconcerns raised by the decriminalization of marijuana use in several states and the \nDistrict of Columbia. The memorandum states that changes to state and local laws do \nnot alter the existing National Security Adjudicative Guidelines. \u201cAn individual\u2019s \ndisregard for federal law pertaining the use, sale, or manufacture of marijuana remains \nadjudicatively relevant in national security determinations.\u201d  \n \n  \nOn May 26, 2015, the Director of the United States Office of Personnel \nManagement (OPM) issued a memorandum titled, \u201cFederal Laws and Policies \nProhibiting Marijuana Use.\u201d The Director of OPM acknowledged that several \njurisdictions have decriminalized the use of marijuana, allowing the use of marijuana for \nmedicinal purposes and/or for limited recreational use but states that Federal law on \nmarijuana remains unchanged. Marijuana is categorized as a controlled substance \nunder Schedule I of the Controlled Substances Act. Thus knowing or intentional \nmarijuana possession is illegal, even if the individual has no intent to manufacture, \ndistribute, or dispense marijuana.  \n    \n \n \n \n\n7 \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s over arching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record.  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nas to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n  \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information).   \n \n \n \n \n \n\n8 \n \nGuideline H, Drug Involvement \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Drug Involvement is set out in \nAG & 24:       \n \n \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of  \nprescription drug and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other \nsubstances that cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a \nmanner inconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about \nan individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior \nmay lead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions questions about a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with \nlaws, rules and regulations. Controlled substance means any \u201ccontrolled \nsubstance\u201d as defined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic \nterm adopted in this guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed \nabove.  \n \nThe guideline notes several disqualifying conditions that could raise security \nconcerns. I find the following drug involvement disqualifying conditions apply to \nApplicant\u2019s case.  \n \nAG & 25(a) any substance misuse; \n \nAG & 25(c) illegal possession of a controlled substance, including \ncultivation, processing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or \npossession of drug paraphernalia; and  \n \nAG & 25(f) any illegal drug use while granted access to classified \ninformation or holding a sensitive position.  \n \nThe SOR alleges and Applicant admits he used marijuana once in 2014 and \nonce in 2016, both times while on vacation with friends in a state where marijuana use \nis legal. AG & 25(a) and AG & 25(c) apply.  His use occurred while he held a security \nclearance. AG & 25(f) applies.  \n  \nThe Government\u2019s substantial evidence and Applicant\u2019s own admissions raise \nsecurity concerns under Guideline H, Drug Involvement. The burden shifted to Applicant \nto produce evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the security concerns. \n(Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15) An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, and \nthe burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. (See ISCR Case No. 02-\n31154 at 5 (App. Bd. September 22, 2005))  \n  \nGuideline H also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns arising from drug involvement. The following mitigating conditions potentially \napply to the Applicant\u2019s case:  \n \nAG \u00b6 26(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not \n\n9 \n \ncast doubt on the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; and \n  \nAG & 26(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this \nproblem, and has established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not \nlimited to: (1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; (2) \nchanging or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; and (3) \nproviding a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug involvement \nand substance misuse, acknowledging that any future involvement or \nmisuse is grounds for revocation of national security eligibility. \n    \n \nAG \u00b6 26(a) applies because three years have passed since Applicant\u2019s last use \nof marijuana. At the time of use, Applicant believed his conduct was not illegal, because \nthe state legalized the use of marijuana. He was unaware that marijuana use remained \nillegal under federal law.  Applicant disclosed marijuana use on several security \nclearance applications in 2013, 2014, and 2016 while in a state where marijuana use \nwas legal. Although there was an additional admitted use of marijuana in 2013 by \nApplicant that was not alleged in the SOR, I find the discrepancies in the number of \ntimes used to be minimal. Once he learned marijuana use was illegal under federal law, \nhe stopped using marijuana. Applicant has not used marijuana for over three years, and \nhe was forthcoming about his marijuana use, which shows trustworthiness.  \n \n \nAG \u00b6 26(b) applies. Applicant stopped using marijuana in January 2016, when he \ndiscovered marijuana use remains illegal under federal law even though it is legal in the \nstate where he used it. He was not a regular user. Although he attended the annual trip \nfor ten years, he stopped attending to avoid being around his friends who use \nmarijuana. He no longer associates with anyone who uses marijuana or any other illegal \nnarcotic, On October 25, 2018, he provided a signed statement of intent to refrain from \nall drug involvement and substance misuse. Applicant was truthful about his marijuana \nuse and demonstrated an appropriate pattern of abstinence.  \n \n \nApplicant met his burden to mitigate the security concerns raised under Guideline \nH, Drug Involvement. Applicant is warned that any future illegal marijuana use will result \nin the revocation of his security clearance.  \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \n \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Personal Conduct is set out in \nAG &15: \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during the national \nsecurity or adjudicative processes.  \n \n\n10 \n \n \nThe following disqualifying conditions potentially apply to Applicant\u2019s case: \n \nAG \u00b6 16(c) credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue \nareas that is not sufficient for an adverse determination under any other \nsingle guideline, but which, when considered as a whole, supports a \nwhole-person assessment of questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, \nunreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and \nregulations, or other characteristics indicating that the individual may not \nproperly safeguard classified or sensitive information; \n \nAG & 16(e) personal conduct, or concealment of information about one\u2019s \nconduct , that creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or \nduress by a foreign intelligence entity or other individual or group. Such \nconduct includes: \n \n(1) engaging in activities which, if know, could affect the person\u2019s \npersonal, professional, or community standing.   \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 16(c) applies to Applicant\u2019s marijuana use while entrusted with a security \nclearance. Applicant\u2019s past conduct raises issues about his judgment, reliability, and \nwillingness to comply with rules and regulations. This raises doubts as to Applicant\u2019s \nability to protect classified information.   \n \n \nAG & 16(e) applies because Applicant\u2019s illegal marijuana use has the potential to \naffect his personal, professional, or community standing. As a senior leader of his \ncompany, Applicant should have demonstrated better judgment when opting to use \nmarijuana even though it was legal in the state where he used it. He should have \nresearched whether there would be security concerns raised when using marijuana \neven in a state where marijuana was legalized.   \n \n \nUnder Guideline E, the following mitigating conditions potentially apply in \nApplicant\u2019s case: \n \nAG \u00b6 17(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the \nbehavior is so infrequent, or it happened under such unique \ncircumstances that is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the \nindividual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n \n  \nAG \u00b6 17(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained \ncounseling to change the behavior or taken other positive steps to \nalleviate the stressors, circumstances or factors that contributed to \nuntrustworthy, unreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such \nbehavior is unlikely to recur; and  \n \nAG & 17(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate \nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress.  \n \n\n11 \n \n \nAll above mitigating conditions apply. Applicant used marijuana because it was \nlegal under the state law. He was not aware that it was illegal under federal law. Upon \nlearning it was illegal under federal law, Applicant immediately stopped using marijuana. \nHe no longer attends the annual trip where the marijuana use occurred. Applicant was \nhonest about his marijuana use and once he understood that his marijuana use was an \nissue, he stopped. He has not used marijuana in three years.  He was not addicted to \nmarijuana. He learned a difficult lesson, and his past marijuana use no longer casts \ndoubt on his reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.    \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept.        \n \nThere are reasons that support not granting a security clearance to Applicant.  \nQuestions are raised about Applicant\u2019s judgment because of his failure to look into \nwhether marijuana use in state where it was legalized would raise a security concern. \nHaving held a security clearance since 2008, he should have known better. There is \nsome evidence that he was told during a 2015 background investigation interview that \nmarijuana remained illegal under federal law, yet he used marijuana in January 2016.  \n \nI find the mitigating reasons outweigh the disqualifying reasons in Applicant\u2019s \ncase.  His honesty in disclosing his marijuana use during the security clearance process \nsupports that he is trustworthy. At the location where he used the marijuana it was legal \nunder state law.  Once he understood that marijuana remained illegal under federal law \nand was incompatible with holding a security clearance, he stopped using marijuana \nand has not used marijuana for over three years. He signed a statement of intent to \nrefrain from all drug involvement and substance misuse and acknowledged that any \nfuture substance misuse would result in the revocation of his security clearance. \nApplicant is a successful businessman who is highly regarded among his peers. He is a \nfamily man. He and his wife have three children.     \n \n\n12 \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant has learned a significant \nlesson.  Having been denied access to SCI in October 2016, he learned from his \nmistake in judgment and took steps to demonstrate his intent to refrain from illegal \nmarijuana use. Concerns raised by Applicant\u2019s illegal marijuana use are mitigated. \nApplicant is warned that any future illegal marijuana use will result in the revocation of \nApplicant\u2019s security clearance.   \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the \nSOR, as required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline H:  \n \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:   \n \n \nFOR APPLICANT  \n \n \n \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \n \n \nFor Applicant  \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is  \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is granted.  Applicant is warned \nthat any future use of illegal substances will result in the revocation of his security \nclearance.  \n \n \n \n                                           \n \n \n \n_________________ \nERIN C.

Based on a \nreview of the pleadings and exhibits, national security eligibility for a position of trust is \ngranted.  \nStatement of the Case \nOn January 25, 2018, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications \nFacility (DOD CAF) issued to Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR), detailing \ntrustworthiness concerns under Guideline F, Financial Considerations. The action was \ntaken under DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance \nReview Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the Adjudicative \nGuidelines (AG) effective within the DOD on June 8, 2017.  \nApplicant submitted an Answer to the SOR on May 8, 2018, and elected to have \nher case decided on the written record in lieu of a hearing. Department Counsel submitted \nits file of relevant material (FORM) on August 23, 2018. Applicant received it on \nSeptember 19, 2018. The Government\u2019s evidence is identified as Items 1 through 8. The \n01/16/2019\n\n \n \n2 \n \n \nFORM notified Applicant that she had an opportunity to file objections and submit material \nin refutation, extenuation, or mitigation within 30 days of her receipt of the FORM. \nApplicant submitted responses to the FORM on October 17 and 18, 2018 (Reply). Items \n1 through 8 and Applicant\u2019s Reply are admitted into the record, without objection. The \ncase was assigned to me on January 8, 2019.                           \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant admitted the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.e, with explanations. \n(Answer.) The allegations are supported by credit reports dated November 21, 2017, and \nJune 7, 2018. (Item 6; Item 7.) \n \n \nApplicant is 23 years old. She is single and resides with her mother to save money. \nShe was enrolled in classes from June 2013 to May 2014 at a university, and then \ntransferred to a college in October 2015. As of July 2016, she was still enrolled in classes \nat the college. She worked part time as a clerk in a discount retail store from November \n2014 to present. Prior to that, she was an unemployed student. (Reply; Answer; Item 4; \nItem 7.) \n \n \nApplicant is indebted on a lease agreement in the amount of $5,771, as stated in \nSOR \u00b6 1.a. This debt was for student housing while attending the university and became \ndelinquent in 2014. Initially, she did not realize that this loan was separate from her \nstudent-loan accounts addressed below. However, when she realized it was a separate \ndebt, she contacted this creditor and set up an arrangement to pay $150 monthly until \nthis debt is resolved. She provided the name of her point of contact and a phone number \nto verify her payments under the agreement. While she did not provide documentation of \npayments under this agreement, she appears to be resolving this debt. (Reply.) \n \n \nApplicant is indebted on three student-loan accounts held by the same creditor in \nthe total amount of $10,547, as stated in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b, 1.d, and 1.e. These loans became \ndelinquent in 2016 and 2017. Applicant entered into a repayment agreement with this \ncreditor to resolve these delinquencies through monthly payments of $149. She did not \nestablish a repayment agreement until after receiving the SOR, because she originally \nthought that he mother was repaying this debt. She documented that she has made six \nmonthly payments according to this agreement. These debts are being resolved. (Reply; \nItem 7.) \n \n \nApplicant was indebted on a charged-off account in the amount of $369, as stated \nin SOR \u00b6 1.c. This was a credit card account that became delinquent in 2016. Applicant \nsettled this debt for less than the balance due, as documented in a May 2018 letter from \nthis creditor. It is resolved. (Item 3.) \n \n \nApplicant is addressing her delinquent debts as best she can with the funds that \nshe has available. She lives \u201cpaycheck to paycheck\u201d but is dedicated to resolving her \ndebts in full. (Reply.) \n\n \n \n3 \n \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility, the administrative judge \nmust consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief introductory explanations \nfor each guideline, the AG list potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating \nconditions, which are to be used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a position of \ntrust. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. The entire \nprocess is a conscientious scrutiny of applicable guidelines in the context of a number of \nvariables known as the whole-person concept. The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n \n  \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. I have not drawn inferences based on mere speculation or \nconjecture. \n \n \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.14 requires the Government to present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. According to Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, \u201c[t]he applicant \nis responsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable [trustworthiness] decision.\u201d \n \n \nA person applying for a position of trust seeks to enter into a fiduciary relationship \nwith the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship transcends \nnormal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government reposes a \nhigh degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants national security \neligibility. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the applicant \nmay deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard sensitive information. Such \ndecisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather \nthan actual, risk of compromise of sensitive information.  \n \n \n \n\n \n \n4 \n \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \n \n \nThe trustworthiness concerns relating to the guideline for financial considerations \nare set out in AG \u00b6 18, which reads in pertinent part:  \n \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise trustworthiness concerns \nunder AG \u00b6 19. Two are potentially applicable in this case:   \n \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \n \n  \nApplicant was delinquent on three student loans, a lease agreement, and a credit \ncard in the total amount of $11,022. Her oldest debt has been delinquent since 2014. The \nevidence is sufficient to raise these disqualifying conditions.  \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20 provides conditions that could mitigate trustworthiness concerns. I \nconsidered all of the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20, including the following: \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \n \n \nApplicant has resolved her credit card debt, and documented that she is making \npayments on her three student loans. She has made six payments under that agreement. \nWhile she failed to document payments on the lease, she provided contact information to \nverify her payments and credibly averred that she is paying that debt. There is evidence \nof mitigation under AG \u00b6 20(d), with respect to these debts. \n \n \n\n \n \n5 \n \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s national security eligibility by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct \nand all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \n \nAccording to AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant national \nsecurity eligibility must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \n \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \npertinent facts and circumstances surrounding this case. The Appeal Board has \naddressed a key element in the whole-person analysis in financial cases, stating:  \n \nIn evaluating Guideline F cases, the Board has previously noted that the \nconcept of \u201cmeaningful track record\u201d necessarily includes evidence of actual \ndebt reduction through payment of debts. However, an applicant is not \nrequired, as a matter of law, to establish that he has paid off each and every \ndebt listed in the SOR. All that is required is that an applicant demonstrates \nthat he has \u201c. . . established a plan to resolve his financial problems and \ntaken significant actions to implement that plan.\u201d The Judge can reasonably \nconsider the entirety of an applicant\u2019s financial situation and his actions in \nevaluating the extent to which that applicant\u2019s plan for the reduction of his \noutstanding indebtedness is credible and realistic. See Directive \u00b6 E2.2 (a) \n(\u201cAvailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, \nfavorable and unfavorable, should be considered in reaching a \ndetermination.\u201d) There is no requirement that a plan provide for payments \non all outstanding debts simultaneously. Rather, a reasonable plan (and \nconcomitant conduct) may provide for the payment of such debts one at a \ntime. Likewise, there is no requirement that the first debts actually paid in \nfurtherance of a reasonable debt plan be the ones listed in the SOR.1 \n \n                                                 \n1ISCR Case No. 07-06482 at 2-3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008) (internal citations omitted). \n\n \n \n6 \n \n \n \nApplicant was young when she incurred the alleged delinquencies and relied on \nher mother to manage her finances. She has since matured and began addressing her \ndelinquent accounts. She provided sufficient evidence to demonstrate a plan to resolve \nher outstanding delinquent debts within the standard defined in the above case. The \nlikelihood that financial problems will recur, or Applicant will stop making payments on the \nplans she has initiated, is minimal based on her efforts to date and her knowledge that \nsimilar problems could jeopardize her employment. The potential for pressure, coercion, \nor duress is eliminated by Applicant\u2019s efforts to resolve her debt. Overall, the record \nevidence leaves me without doubt as to Applicant\u2019s judgment, eligibility, and suitability for \na position of trust. She met her burden to mitigate the trustworthiness concerns arising \nunder the guideline for financial considerations. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \n \nFor Applicant                    \n                    Subparagraph 1.b:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n         Subparagraph 1.c:  \n \n \nFor Applicant  \n \n         Subparagraph 1.d:  \n \n \nFor Applicant  \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.e:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a public trust position. \nNational security eligibility for access to sensitive information is granted. \n \n                                            \n \n \n \n \n \nJennifer Goldstein \nAdministrative Judge \n",

The evidence is not sufficient to mitigate his history of \nfinancial problems, which is ongoing. He has not taken any substantial affirmative action \nto resolve more than $20,000 in delinquent debt. Accordingly, this case is decided \nagainst Applicant.    \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nApplicant completed and submitted a Standard Form (SF) 86, Questionnaire for \nNational Security Positions, the official form used for personnel security investigations, \non September 1, 2016. (Exhibit 1) This document is commonly known as a security \nclearance application. Thereafter, on January 26, 2018, after reviewing the application \nand the information gathered during a background investigation, the Department of \nDefense Consolidated Adjudications Facility, Fort Meade, Maryland, sent Applicant a \nstatement of reasons (SOR), explaining it was unable to find that it was clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant him eligibility for access to classified \n\n \n2 \n \ninformation. The SOR is similar to a complaint. It detailed the factual reasons for the \naction under the security guideline known as Guideline F for financial considerations.   \n \nApplicant answered the SOR on February 19, 2018. He admitted the nine \ndelinquent debts alleged in the SOR. He also requested a hearing before an \nadministrative judge. In addition, he provided a brief explanation that he was currently \nworking on repaying his overdue creditors by paying off the smallest debt first and then \nmoving to the next, and he stated that he would present proof of payment at the \nhearing.   \n \nThe case was assigned to another judge on May 15, 2018, and then reassigned \nto me on May 22, 2018. The hearing took place as scheduled on September 19, 2018. \nApplicant appeared without counsel. Both Department Counsel and Applicant offered \ndocumentary exhibits, which were admitted as Exhibits 1-5 and A, respectively. \nApplicant relied on his own testimony and called no other witnesses. The hearing \ntranscript (Tr.) was received on September 26, 2018.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant is a 35-year-old employee who is seeking to retain a security clearance \nat a higher level than previously granted to him in 2008. (Tr. 7) He is employed as a \nsystem administrator for a company in the defense industry. He has been so employed \nsince November 2015; he transferred to his current location in July 2016.

He worked overseas until about May 2014 when the \ncontract ended. He was then out of work for about three months, from May 2014 to \nAugust 2014. During that time, he enjoyed spending time with his family, including two \ntrips to Hawaii to visit family. He returned to work as a system administrator in August \n2014 and had that job until September 2015, when he was laid off. He was then out of \nwork for about two months, from September 2015 to November 2015, when he began \nworking for his current employer. Other than those three periods, Applicant has had full-\ntime employment in his field since at least June 2006.  \n \nThe SOR concerns a history of financial problems consisting of nine delinquent \naccounts, in collection or charged off, in amounts ranging from $88 to $10,593 for a total \nof about $21,674. The two largest debts, for $10,593 and $6,158, stem from automobile \nloans that ended in repossession resulting in deficiency balances. None of the nine \ndelinquent debts are medical collection accounts. Applicant admitted all the SOR \n\n \n3 \n \nallegations in his answer to the SOR and during his hearing testimony. In addition, the \ndelinquent debts are established by credit reports from 2016, 2017, and 2018. (Exhibits \n2-5). None of the nine delinquent debts were paid, settled, entered into a repayment \narrangement, forgiven, cancelled, or otherwise resolved. (Tr. 31)  \n \nOverall, Applicant attributed his financial problems or difficulties to unemployment \nand the expenses associated with providing for his fianc\u00e9e and young child. He \naccepted the job in Afghanistan, where he earned more than $100,000 annually, not \nincluding a substantial bonus, in order to focus on reducing his student loan debt. (Tr. \n25, 35-36) He stated that he reduced the balance from about $40,000 to $11,000. (Tr. \n35) The most recent credit report from September 2018 shows a balance of $19,818 \nwith $0 past due. (Exhibit 5) Applicant described his current financial situation as living \npaycheck to paycheck. (Tr. 44) He estimated a checking account balance of $1,000 and \na savings account balance of $0. (Tr. 37-38) The September 2018 credit report shows a \nnew collection account for $680 stemming from an apartment lease. (Exhibit 5; Tr. 36-\n37) \n \nIn September 2018, a few days before the hearing in this case, Applicant \nretained the services of a firm that specializes in credit repair and optimization. (Exhibit \nA; Tr. 27-29) He pays a monthly fee of $100 for the service. His goal is to restore his \ncredit to good standards.  \n  \nLaw and Policies \n \n \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (E.O.) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of \nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review \nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the National Security \nAdjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information or \nEligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position (AG), effective June 8, 2017. \n \nIt is well-established law that no one has a right to a security clearance.1 As \nnoted by the Supreme Court in Department of the Navy v. Egan, \u201cthe clearly consistent \nstandard indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the \nside of denials.\u201d2 Under Egan, Executive Order 10865, and the Directive, any doubt \nabout whether an applicant should be allowed access to classified information will be \nresolved in favor of protecting national security. In Egan, the Supreme Court stated that \nthe burden of proof is less than a preponderance of evidence.3 The Appeal Board has \n                                                          \n1 Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988) (\u201cit should be obvious that no one has a \n\u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance\u201d); Duane v. Department of Defense, 275 F.3d 988, 994 (10th Cir. 2002) (no \nright to a security clearance).  \n \n2 484 U.S. at 531. \n \n3 484 U.S. at 531. \n \n\n \n4 \n \nfollowed the Court\u2019s reasoning, and a judge\u2019s findings of fact are reviewed under the \nsubstantial-evidence standard.4 \n \n \nThere is no presumption in favor of granting, renewing, or continuing eligibility for \naccess to classified information.5 Under the Directive, the parties have the following \nburdens: (1) Department Counsel has the burden of presenting evidence to establish \nfacts alleged in the SOR that have been controverted; (2) an applicant is responsible for \npresenting evidence to refute, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts that have been \nadmitted or proven; and (3) an applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain \na favorable clearance decision.6 \n \nDiscussion \n \n \nUnder Guideline F for financial considerations, the suitability of an applicant may \nbe questioned or put into doubt when that applicant has a history of excessive \nindebtedness or financial problems or difficulties. The overall concern is set forth in AG \n\u00b6 18 as follows: \n \nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. . . . \n \n \nThe concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified or sensitive information to obtain money or something else of \nvalue. It encompasses concerns about a person\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other \nimportant qualities. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified or sensitive \ninformation. \n \n \nIn analyzing the facts of this case, I considered the following disqualifying and \nmitigating conditions as most pertinent:  \n \nAG \u00b6 19(a) inability to satisfy debts;  \n \nAG \u00b6 19(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations;  \n \nAG \u00b6 20(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were \nlargely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce, or \n                                                          \n4 ISCR Case No. 01-20700 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002) (citations omitted).  \n \n5 ISCR Case No. 02-18663 (App. Bd. Mar. 23, 2004). \n \n6 Directive, Enclosure 3, \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.14 and E3.1.15. \n \n\n \n5 \n \nseparation, clear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity \ntheft), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; and  \n \nAG \u00b6 20(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to \nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.  \n \n \nThe evidence supports a conclusion that Applicant has a history of financial \nproblems that is sufficient to raise a security concern under Guideline F. The \ndisqualifying conditions noted above apply to this case.  \n \n \nApplicant is in a difficult situation dealing with a large amount of indebtedness \nwith a number of creditors or collectors. His problematic financial history is traceable to \nthree relatively brief periods of unemployment during 2012-2015. One of those periods \nalso served as rest and recreation after returning from his job in Afghanistan. The job \nlayoffs and periods of unemployment were circumstances largely beyond his control. He \nused the additional income he earned working in Afghanistan during 2012-2014 to \nattack the large balance on his student loan, which was not unreasonable.  \n \n \nNevertheless, what is missing here is obvious; namely, Applicant failed to take \nany substantial affirmative action (\u201ca good-faith effort\u201d) to resolve the nine delinquent \ndebts for more than $20,000 in the SOR. Not even the smallest collection account for \n$88 was paid. This lack of action occurred despite his full-time employment since \nNovember 2015, and earning a decent income ranging from $65,000 to $78,000 at \npresent. His action in September 2018 in retaining a credit-repair firm cannot be \nconsidered a good-faith effort at this time. It is an initial step in the right direction, but it \nis too soon to tell if it will result in either a large or small reduction of his indebtedness. \nGiven the totality of facts and circumstances, the evidence is not sufficient to mitigate \nthe security concern stemming from his long-standing history of financial problems, \nwhich is ongoing and likely to continue for the foreseeable future.  \n \n \nFollowing Egan and the clearly consistent standard, I have doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, good judgment, and ability to protect classified or \nsensitive information. In reaching this conclusion, I weighed the evidence as a whole \nand considered if the favorable evidence outweighed the unfavorable evidence or vice \nversa. I also considered the whole-person concept. I conclude that he has not met his \nultimate burden of persuasion to show that it is clearly consistent with the national \ninterest to grant him eligibility for access to classified information.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nThe formal findings on the SOR allegations are: \n \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nAgainst Applicant  \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a -- 1.i:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n\n \n6 \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIt is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for \naccess to classified information.

The action was taken under DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive), and the adjudicative guidelines (AG\u2019s) effective within \nthe DOD for SORs issued after June 8, 2017.  \nApplicant timely answered the SOR on March 1, 2018, and elected to have a \nhearing before an administrative judge. The case was assigned to me on April 16, 2018. \nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Notice of Hearing \n(NOH) scheduling the hearing on August 8, 2018. Government Exhibits (GE) 1 \u2013 2 and \n09/17/2018\n\n \n2 \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s Exhibit (AE) A were admitted without objection. DOHA received the \ntranscript of the hearing (Tr.) on August 21, 2018. \n \n \n \n                   .    \n \n  \nApplicant is 55 years old. She graduated from high school in 1980. She has been \nemployed as a team lead for support staff at a federal contractor since 2007. (Tr. 10) \nApplicant married in 1985 and divorced in 1995. She has a 28-year-old daughter.   \n \n \n \nApplicant disclosed that she used marijuana (MJ) twice in section 23 of her May \n12, 2017, Electronic Questionnaires for Investigations Processing, also known as her \nsecurity clearance application (SCA). She testified that she smoked MJ on her \nhouseboat on a lake over the July 4th weekend in 2016 when a cigarette-joint was \nprovided by her boyfriend. (Tr. 14-16) It was Applicant\u2019s opinion that MJ should be \nlegalized. So, she thought she would try it to see what she was promoting. The MJ \ncigarette had no discernible effect on Applicant. (Tr. 16) She continues to see her \nboyfriend approximately once a week. (Tr. 17) Applicant attended a Christmas evening \nparty in  2016 with the same boyfriend, and somebody provided hard candy laced with \nMJ. Applicant ingested the candy. Again, it had no impact on her. (Tr. 18) She did not \npurchase the MJ on either occasion.  \n \n \n \nThe SOR contains two allegations under Guideline H, drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse. Applicant admitted both allegations in her Answer to the SOR, \nincluding SOR \u00b6 1.b, which alleged that she used MJ, from about July 2016 to August \n2017, while holding a position of trust. She testified that she did not even think about her \nfederal position of trust when she used MJ, and it was just \u201cbad judgment.\u201d (Tr. 20) It is \nunclear that Applicant understood that use of illegal drugs was prohibited by her public \nposition of trust before she completed the SCA in May 2017. Applicant explained that \nwhen she filled out the SCA, it then became obvious to her that such illegal drug use \nwas a concern to the federal government, based on the questions in section 23 of the \nSCA. (Tr. 22-23) She answered \u201cno\u201d to the question about any intentions to use illegal \ndrugs in the future. Applicant was aware that her employer maintained a drug-free \nworkplace and required her to have a drug screen as part of the in-processing when she \nobtained her job as a team-lead for support staff in 2007. (Tr. 22) \n \n \n \nApplicant testified that she used MJ with her boyfriend a third time in August \n2017, after she completed the SCA and became aware of the government\u2019s concern. \n(Tr. 24) Again, it occurred on their houseboat on the lake when her boyfriend \nencouraged Applicant to try a stronger MJ cigarette to see if it would have any \nphysiological impact. (Tr. 24) It did not, but it does impact her eligibility for a public \nposition of trust. Consistent with her answer in section 23 of the SCA, Applicant testified \nthat she has no intention to use MJ again in the future. (Tr. 21) She also completed a \n                                                          \n2 Unless otherwise indicated, these facts were taken from Applicant\u2019s Electronic Questionnaires for \nInvestigations Processing (e-QIP) also known as a security clearance application (SCA) dated May 12, \n2017 (GE 1), and the summary of Applicant\u2019s enhanced subject interview conducted on October 19, 2017 \n(GE 2). \n \n\n \n3 \n \n \nhand-written statement at the hearing to the effect that she agreed to abstain from all \nfuture use of MJ subject to revocation of her public position of trust if she violated this \nagreement. (AE A) Applicant testified that her boyfriend is not a frequent MJ user and \nshe admits she made \u201ca bad choice\u201d and learned a valuable lesson. (Tr. 34) She never \nused MJ until age 54, and used it fewer than five times total. (Answer)  \n \n \n        \nPolicies \n \n \nPositions designated as ADP I and ADP II are classified as \u201csensitive positions.\u201d \n(See Code of Federal Regulations Title 32 \u2013 National Defense, part 154.13 and part \n154, Appendix J \u2013 ADP Position Categories and Criteria for Designating Positions)  \n\u201cThe standard that must be met for . . . assignment to sensitive duties is that, based on \nall available information, the person\u2019s loyalty, reliability, and trustworthiness are such \nthat . . . assigning the person to sensitive duties is clearly consistent with the interests of \nnational security.\u201d The Deputy Under Secretary of Defense (Counterintelligence and \nSecurity) Memorandum, dated November 19, 2004, indicates trustworthiness \nadjudications will apply to cases forwarded to DOHA by the Defense Security Service \nand Office of Personnel Management. Department of Defense contractor personnel are \nafforded the right to the procedures contained in DOD Directive 5220.6 before any final \nunfavorable access determination may be made.  \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a public trust position, the \nadministrative judge must consider the disqualifying and mitigating conditions in the AG. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of \nhuman behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the \nadjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, \nimpartial and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a \nconscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d \nThe administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the \nperson, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \n[sensitive] information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable trustworthiness decision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to sensitive information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \ngovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to sensitive information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \n\n \n4 \n \n \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nsensitive information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of sensitive information. \n \nAnalysis \n  \nGuideline H, Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \n \nThe trustworthiness concern for drug involvement and substance misuse is set \nout in AG \u00b6 24:   \n \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior \nmay lead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. Controlled substance means any \u201ccontrolled substance\u201d \nas defined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term \nadopted in this guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above. \n \nThe guideline notes conditions that could raise security concerns under AG \u00b6 25. \nThe following are potentially applicable in this case:   \n \n(a) any substance misuse (see above definition); and \n \n(f) any illegal drug use while granted access to classified information \n    or holding a sensitive position.  \n \nApplicant deliberately ingested MJ three times in the presence of her boyfriend. \nThe third time was after she became aware of the government\u2019s concern that this was a \nbreach of her public position of trust. The above disqualifying conditions are applicable \nsince she intended to ingest the MJ while holding a public position of trust.  \n \nAG \u00b6 26 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. The following \nare potentially applicable:  \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \nand \n \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this \n\n \n5 \n \n \nproblem, and has established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not \nlimited to: \n \n     (1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; \n \n     (2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; and \n \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that any future \ninvolvement or misuse   is grounds for revocation of national security \neligibility.  \n \nApplicant provided credible testimony that she believes MJ should be legalized \nand she wanted to experience the drug\u2019s effect. While she is not a habitual user, this \nwas not a one-time innocent ingestion. She testified that she has not completely \ndisassociated from friends, such as her boyfriend, who use illegal drugs. Although she \nsigned a statement of her intent to abstain from future use, she violated that same \nassurance when she re-offended after answering the questions in section 23 of her \nSCA. Since she used MJ as recently as August of 2017, there has been insufficient \npassage of time to confidently conclude that she will not violate again. I have remaining \nconcerns about her reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. AG \u00b6 26(a) is not \napplicable, and AG \u00b6 26(b) is only partially applicable.  \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a position of trust by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nThe ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a public trust position \nmust be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the \nguidelines and the whole-person concept.  \n       \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments \nunder Guideline H in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were \naddressed under those guidelines. Applicant has served for 11 years as a team-lead for \n\n \n6 \n \n \na federal contractor. She self-disclosed her MJ use, and cooperated fully in the process. \nYet, in her own words she exercised bad judgment and made a mistake, learning a hard \nlesson.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s drug use remains a trustworthiness concern. She has not met her \nburden of persuasion. The record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s suitability for a public trust position. For all these reasons, I conclude \nApplicant failed to mitigate the drug involvement and substance misuse trustworthiness \nconcerns. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline H:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.b:                         Against Applicant \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   Conclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a public trust \nposition. Eligibility for access to sensitive information is denied. \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \n                                                      Robert J.

Cervi, Administrative Judge \nThis case involves security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial \nConsiderations). Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nStatement of the Case \nApplicant submitted a security clearance application (SCA) on October 23, 2016. \nOn February 2, 2018, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications Facility \n(DOD CAF) sent him a statement of reasons (SOR) alleging security concerns under \nGuideline F.1 Applicant answered the SOR and requested a hearing. \nThe case was assigned to me on August 3, 2018. The Defense Office of Hearings \nand Appeals (DOHA) issued a notice of hearing on November 8, 2018, scheduling the \n1 The DOD CAF acted under Executive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \nIndustry (February 20, 1960), as amended; and DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel \nSecurity Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive). The Adjudicative \nGuidelines (AG) were revised effective June 8, 2017, and apply herein. \n02/27/2019\n\n \n2 \n \nhearing for November 19, 2018. The hearing was convened as scheduled. Government \nExhibits (GE) 1 through 4 were admitted in evidence without objection. Applicant testified. \nThe record was held open to permit Applicant to submit documentary evidence in \nmitigation, but no evidence was submitted. DOHA received the hearing transcript (Tr.) on \nNovember 29, 2018. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant is a 32-year-old firearms instructor, employed by a defense contractor \nsince January 2017. He graduated from high school in 2004. He married in 2005 and \ndivorced in 2007, and has one 11-year-old child. He served in the Army National Guard \nfrom 2003 until being honorably discharged in 2009. Applicant held a security clearance \nfrom 2004 to 2009. \n \nThe SOR alleges Applicant is delinquent on three debts totaling approximately \n$40,000; defaulted on a mortgage and the home was foreclosed in 2013; and failed to file \nFederal and state income tax returns for tax years 2015 and 2016. The SOR allegations \nare supported by substantial evidence. Applicant admitted the SOR allegations with \nexplanations. \n \nApplicant\u2019s financial problems began after he divorced in 2007. He incurred sole \nresponsibility for a child-support obligation, home mortgage and other expenses. He was \nunable to make the mortgage payments, defaulted in about 2008 and the home was \nforeclosed in 2013. (SOR \u00b6 1.f) No deficiency is owed and his credit report no longer \nshows the debt.  \n \nOther debts include a $39,633 car loan that was reported in his 2017 credit report \nas $2,192 past-due. (SOR \u00b6 1.c) Applicant stated that he used the loan payments to pay \nfor trips to visit his ill father from 2017 until he passed away in 2018. He testified that he \nwas eight months behind in payments and owed about $32,000. He did not have an \nagreement to resolve the delinquent account. Applicant claimed that he paid two small \ndebts listed in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d and 1.e, in February or March 2017 with a debit card. No record \nof the payments was submitted, but they are no longer reflected in his most current credit \nreport. \n \nApplicant testified that he failed to file Federal and state income tax returns for tax \nyears 2015 to 2017 because of stress from a custody dispute with his ex-spouse, and \nthat he is waiting to accumulate sufficient funds to pay a tax lawyer or someone to assist \nhim, and to pay approximately $3,000 in taxes owed. He noted in testimony that he is \nunfamiliar with how to file delinquent tax returns and he could not find a tax preparer \noutside of tax season, but admitted that he had not been diligent in that effort. \n \nApplicant earns about $80,000 per year, has a monthly net remainder of about \n$800, and $1,000 in savings. He has not sought financial counseling. \n \n \n\n \n3 \n \nLaw and Policies \n \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 2. \n \nNational security eligibility is predicated upon the applicant meeting the criteria \ncontained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. \nInstead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge applies \nthese guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative \njudge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider a person\u2019s stability, trustworthiness, reliability, \ndiscretion, character, honesty, and judgment. AG \u00b6 1(b). \n \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865  \n\u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \n \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \u201cSubstantial \nevidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. Washington \nMetro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines presume a \nnexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria listed \ntherein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 12-01295 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Jan. 20, 2015). \n \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition,  \n \n\n \n4 \n \nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. \n02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \n \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01- \n20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see, AG \u00b6 1(d). \n \nAnalysis \n \nFinancial Considerations \n \nThe security concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \n \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. . . .  \n \nThe relevant disqualifying conditions under AG \u00b6 19 include: \n \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \n \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired. \n \nApplicant\u2019s admissions and the documentary evidence are sufficient to establish \nthe disqualifying conditions above. \n \nThe following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially relevant: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n\n \n5 \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue; and \n \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority \nto file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \n \nApplicant\u2019s financial status was likely negatively impacted by his divorce. He \ntestified that his divorce resulted in increased expenses, child support, and an inability to \nmeet the mortgage payments. He also attributed his inability to pay debts such as his car \nloan, on the need for the money to attend to his father. His reasons for not filing income-\ntax returns when due is less clear.  Applicant has known of his debts and the need to file \nincome tax returns for some time, but has not taken action to address them. In addition, \nhe testified that he owes past-due taxes. He has not provided a financial statement to \nshow his current financial status, and he has not taken action to resolve his tax issues. \nTwo small debts he claimed to have paid are no longer reflected in his latest credit report, \nand are presumed to be resolved. \n \nApplicant\u2019s lack of financial responsibility with regard to tax obligations, and the car \nloan is particularly concerning. He showed an inability or unwillingness to engage his \ncreditor and the IRS to resolve these accounts. He has not sought financial counseling, \nand has not disputed his debts or the amounts owed.  \n \nThe Appeal Board has long held: \n \nSecurity requirements include consideration of a person\u2019s judgment, \nreliability, and a sense of his or her legal obligations. Cafeteria & Restaurant \nWorkers Union, Local 473 v. McElroy, 284 F.2d 173, 183 (D.C. Cir. 1960), \naff\u2019d, 367 U.S. 886 (1961). Failure to comply with Federal tax laws suggests \nthat an applicant has a problem with abiding by well-established \ngovernment rules and regulations. Voluntary compliance with rules and \nregulations is essential for protecting classified information. See, e.g., \nISCR Case No. 14-04437 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 15, 2016). \n \nOverall, I find that Applicant has not adequately addressed his delinquent debt and \ntax obligations, nor has he shown the financial responsibility expected of security \n\n \n6 \n \nclearance applicants. I find insufficient evidence that his financial status is under control \nand that similar problems are unlikely to recur. No conditions apply to mitigate his \ndelinquent tax obligations and car loan. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6\u00b6 2(a), 2(c), and 2(d), the ultimate determination of whether to grant \nnational security eligibility must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. Under the whole-person \nconcept, the administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security \nclearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process \nfactors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d).2 Although adverse information concerning a single criterion \nmay not be sufficient for an unfavorable eligibility determination, the individual may be \nfound ineligible if available information reflects a recent or recurring pattern of \nquestionable judgment, irresponsibility, or unstable behavior. AG \u00b6 2(e). \n \nI considered all of the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of \nall the facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my findings of \nfact and comments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. Applicant\u2019s military \nservice and personal difficulties do not overcome his history of financial irresponsibility. \n \nAccordingly, I conclude Applicant has not carried his burden of showing that it is \nclearly consistent with the national security interests of the United States to grant him \neligibility for access to classified information. \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a - 1.c:   \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nSubparagraphs 1.d - 1.f: \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \n \n                                                     \n2 (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to \ninclude knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age \nand maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence \nor absence of rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or \nrecurrence. \n\n \n7 \n \nConclusion \n \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national security interests of the \nUnited States to grant Applicant eligibility for access to classified information.

Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nStatement of the Case \nOn March 21, 2018, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications \nFacility (DOD CAF) sent Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) alleging security \nconcerns under Guideline H. The DOD CAF acted under Executive Order 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended \n(Exec.

By email dated July 12, 2018, he admitted both \nallegations.  \n \nDepartment Counsel submitted the Government\u2019s written case on August 13, \n2018. A complete copy of the file of relevant material (FORM) was provided to Applicant, \nwho was afforded an opportunity to file objections and submit material to refute, \nextenuate, or mitigate the security concerns. Applicant received the FORM on August 21, \n2018. His response was undated. It was received by the Defense Office of Hearings and \nAppeals (DOHA) on September 17, 2018. Department Counsel did not object to \nApplicant\u2019s response to the FORM, and it is admitted into the record. In his response to \nthe FORM, Applicant did not object to the Government\u2019s evidence, which was attached \nto Department Counsel\u2019s FORM as Items 1 through 6. In his September 2018 FORM \nresponse, Applicant updated his comments from his November 9, 2017 background \ninterview with his current views on the use of illegal drugs. He also provided a signed \nstatement in which he agreed to the revocation of his security clearance in the event he \nhas any future involvement with illegal drugs.

Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline H (Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse) \n \nThe concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 24:  \n \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual's reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior may \nlead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. Controlled substance means any \u201ccontrolled substance\u201d as \ndefined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term adopted in \nthis guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s admissions and the documentary evidence in the FORM establish the \npotentially disqualifying condition in AG \u00b6 25(a) (any substance misuse (see above \ndefinition)). \n \n \n\n \n5 \n \n \nThe following mitigating conditions under Guideline H are potentially applicable: \n \nAG \u00b6 26(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \nhappened under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not \ncast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \nAG \u00b6 26(b): the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this \nproblem, and has established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not \nlimited to: \n \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; \n \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; \nand \n \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that any future \ninvolvement or misuse is grounds for revocation of national security \neligibility. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 26(a) is not established. Applicant\u2019s last illegal use of a controlled substance \noccurred after he submitted his SCA and less than one year before his response to \nDepartment Counsel\u2019s FORM. This period of abstinence suggests that the behavior may \nnot recur, but is not long enough to establish that it is unlikely to recur. Applicant\u2019s choice \nto waive a hearing gave me no opportunity to assess his sincerity in committing to abstain \nfrom using marijuana in the future. Also, the recency of his last use of marijuana continues \nto cast doubt on his reliability and judgment. The fact that he first expressed his change \nin attitude about marijuana use after he received Department Counsel\u2019s FORM in August \n2018 also supports this conclusion.  \n \n \nAG \u00b6 26(b) is partially established. Applicant has established a pattern of \nabstinence, however, he continued to use marijuana after submitting his SCA and has \nonly abstained after being advised by an investigator that he could not qualify for a \nclearance if he continued to use marijuana in the future. It is well established, however, \nthat \u201cdrug involvement after having completed an SCA draws into serious question the \napplicant\u2019s judgment, reliability, and willingness to follow rules and regulations, insofar as \n[the SCA] placed the applicant on notice of the consequences of such misconduct.\u201d ISCR \nCase No. 16-02877 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct. 2, 2017) citing ISCR Case No. 14-03450 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Sep. 11, 2015). As noted, the period of his abstention is insufficient to constitute \na pattern of abstention. Applicant has represented that he has taken steps referred to in \nthe three subparagraphs of this mitigating condition. Without a longer period of \nabstinence, however, it is too early to conclude that these steps will be sufficient to ensure \nthat Applicant will continue to abstain from illegal drug use. \n \n\n \n6 \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-\nperson concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances and applying the adjudicative factors in AG \u00b6 2(d).2  \n \n \nI have incorporated my comments under Guideline H in my whole-person analysis \nand applied the adjudicative factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). In particular, I have considered \nApplicant\u2019s young age at the time he smoked marijuana and the fact that he was in college \nfor much of the period of his use of marijuana. I cannot conclude, however, that these \nfactors provide sufficient mitigation under the facts of this case largely because \ninsufficient time has passed since Applicant\u2019s last use of marijuana. Applicant has the \nburden of persuasion to establish mitigation, and his evidence, without appearing in \nperson at a hearing, fell short of meeting that burden. After weighing the disqualifying and \nmitigating conditions under Guideline H, and evaluating all the evidence in the context of \nthe whole person, I conclude Applicant has not mitigated the security concerns raised by \nhis past actions. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \n \n \nParagraph 1. Guideline H:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a and 1.b: \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national security interests of the \nUnited States to grant Applicant eligibility for access to classified information. Clearance \nis denied. \n \n \n \n \nJohn Bayard Glendon \nAdministrative Judge \n                                                          \n2 The factors are: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding \nthe conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which participation is voluntary; (6) \nthe presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for \nthe conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of \ncontinuation or recurrence.  \n",

Foreman, Esq., Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro se \n______________ \nDecision \n______________ \nCERVI, Gregg A., Administrative Judge \nThis case involves security concerns raised under Guideline E (Personal Conduct) \nand Guideline F (Financial Considerations). Eligibility for access to classified information \nis denied. \nStatement of the Case \nApplicant submitted a security clearance application (SCA) on December 21, 2016. \nOn March 15, 2018, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications Facility (DOD \nCAF) sent him a Statement of Reasons (SOR) alleging security concerns under \nGuidelines E and F.1 \nApplicant responded to the SOR on April 9, 2018, and requested a hearing before \nan administrative judge. The case was assigned to me on June 18, 2018. The Defense \n1 The DOD CAF acted under Executive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \nIndustry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security \nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the revised adjudicative \nguidelines (AG) effective on June 8, 2017. \n02/15/2019\n\n \n2 \n \nOffice of Hearings and Appeals issued a notice of hearing on July 31, 2018, and the \nhearing was convened on August 28, 2018. Government Exhibits (GE) 1 through 3 were \nadmitted into evidence without objection. Applicant testified at the hearing, but did not \nintroduce any documentary evidence. DOHA received the hearing transcript (Tr.) on \nSeptember 6, 2018. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant is a 62-year-old industrial engineer for a defense contractor, employed \nsince 2004.  Applicant received a bachelor\u2019s degree in 1983 and a master\u2019s degree in \n1985. He married in 1978 and divorced in 1987, and married in 2002 and divorced in \n2015. He has one adult child. He has held a DOD security clearance for 32 years. \n \nThe SOR alleges under Guideline E that Applicant met a woman online that he \nhas not met in person, and borrowed and sent approximately $65,670 to her in Nigeria. \nAs a result, Applicant became delinquent on financial obligations and filed a Chapter 13 \nbankruptcy petition in 2016. The bankruptcy is pending a final discharge. These \nallegations are cross-alleged under Guideline F (financial considerations). Applicant \nadmitted the SOR allegations, and provided explanations in his Answer. \n \nApplicant divorced from his second spouse in October 2015, incurred responsibility \nfor nearly all of the marital debt, and gave up about half of his bank assets and retirement \nfund. His household income was reduced once his spouse left. At the same time, \nApplicant believed he was providing financial assistance to a woman, \u201cK,\u201d whom he met \nthrough an online dating site. K was supposedly an American citizen traveling to Nigeria \nfor business. Applicant never met K, but spoke with her in two short phone calls, and often \ntexted with her from 2015 to 2018. During this period, K provided many requests for \nApplicant to send her cash, including problems with getting medically cleared to leave the \ncountry, visa issues, etc. Applicant wanted to help her, so he began sending money via \nWestern Union. In the summer of 2016, Western Union suspected fraud, and prohibited \nhim from sending money to Nigeria with their service. Applicant then used Money Gram \nuntil they refused to continue to send money, also suspecting fraud. Applicant resorted to \nbuying $100 gift cards and sending them to K on his own. Next, K directed Applicant to \ndeposit money into U.S. bank accounts in other people\u2019s names. At first, Applicant sent \n$10,000, but was required to complete a federal financial transaction form for the bank. \nTo avoid completing the form, he sent no more than $6,000 at a time. Applicant borrowed \nabout $69,000 in loans to send to K in Nigeria, and sent another $100,000 over time. \n \nApplicant became delinquent on his mortgage loan and other debts, causing him \nto declare bankruptcy and file a Chapter 13 case in 2016. The Chapter 13 requires a five \nyear payment plan, to be completed in 2021. Applicant declared about $115,000 in debt.  \n \nK was aware of Applicant\u2019s financial distress and bankruptcy, but continued to \npress him for money. He stopped sending cash at the end of 2016 on the warning of his \nbankruptcy attorney, but continued the relationship to the summer of 2018, even after \nreceiving the SOR. Applicant told K where he worked and his job title. However, Applicant \n\n \n3 \n \nnever notified his employer\u2019s facility security officer (FSO), law enforcement, or the dating \nwebsite of the fraud scheme, even by the time of the hearing, but he testified that he is \nconsidering it. \n \nApplicant has not sought psychological counseling, but is considering using the \nservices provided by his employer. He was required to utilize financial counseling before \nfiling bankruptcy. Applicant described his actions with regard to K and his finances as \n\u201clack of good judgment.\u201d He stated he was emotionally involved, was in denial, and \nwanted to believe her. He ended the relationship after it became \u201cpainfully obvious\u201d to \nhim that it was fraudulent. \n \nPolicies \n \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v.

As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527.

Or. 10865 \u00a7 2. \n \nNational security eligibility is predicated upon the applicant meeting the criteria \ncontained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. \nInstead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge applies \nthese guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person.

Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see, AG \u00b6 1(d). \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline E; Personal Conduct \nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the personal conduct security concern: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. \n \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying in this case. The following disqualifying condition are potentially applicable: \n \n(d) credible adverse information that is not explicitly covered under any \nother guideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an adverse \ndetermination, but which, when combined with all available information \nsupports a whole-person assessment of questionable judgment, \nuntrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with \nrules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that the person may \nnot properly safeguard protected information. This includes but is not limited \nto consideration of: \n \n(1) untrustworthy or unreliable behavior to include breach of client \nconfidentiality, release of proprietary information, unauthorized \n\n \n5 \n \nrelease of sensitive corporate or other government protected \ninformation . . .  \n \n(e) personal conduct, or concealment of information about one\u2019s conduct, \nthat creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress by a \nforeign intelligence entity or other individual or group. Such conduct \nincludes:  \n \n(1) engaging in activities which, if known, could affect the person\u2019s \npersonal, professional, or community standing; and  \n \n(g) association with persons involved in criminal activity. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying in this case. The personal conduct alleged is generally sufficient to implicate \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 16 (d), (e), and (g). \n \nGuideline E includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising from \npersonal conduct. I have considered all of the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 17 and \nfound the following relevant: \n \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, \nunreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to \nrecur;  \n \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate vulnerability \nto exploitation, manipulation, or duress; and \n \n(g) association with persons involved in criminal activities was unwitting, \nhas ceased, or occurs under circumstances that do not cast doubt upon the \nindividual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, judgment, or willingness to comply \nwith rules and regulations. \nApplicant participated in the scheme to transfer money to a possible foreign \nnational was initially unwittingly, however, once money transfer companies began to \nquestion the transactions, he should have known that the scheme was likely fraudulent. \nHis inability to realize the fraudulent nature of the relationship early on, exposes a long \nseries of errors in judgment, and calls into question Applicant\u2019s willingness and ability to \nsafeguard protected information. Although he has now acknowledged the relationship \n\n \n6 \n \nwas likely fraudulent, he continued to have contact with K long after he was notified of the \nlikely fraudulent nature of the relationship. He disclosed his employment and job title, and \nhas been reluctant to report the relationship to his employer\u2019s FSO, the dating website, \nor law enforcement. He has not sought counseling to assist him in preventing similar \nconduct in the future. Based on his significant loss of good judgment and secretive nature \nof his relationship, Applicant has not shown sufficient evidence of mitigation. I am not \nconvinced that this incident is behind him or that similar high-risk and irresponsible \nbehavior will not recur. No mitigation fully applies. \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \n \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. . . .  \n \nThe relevant disqualifying conditions under AG \u00b6 19 include: \n \n(a) inability to satisfy debts;  \n \n(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so; and \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \n \nApplicant\u2019s admissions, testimony, and the documentary evidence in the record \nare sufficient to establish the disqualifying conditions AG \u00b6\u00b6 18 (a), (b), and (c). \n \nThe following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially relevant: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; \n\n \n7 \n \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue. \n \nApplicant\u2019s involvement in a thinly-veiled relationship to fraudulently extract money \nfrom him was at first unwitting; however, it quickly became apparent to be a fraudulent \nscheme with a possible foreign national. His continued involvement with borrowing money \nand transferring about $169,000 to a \u201cperson\u201d he never met invokes a significant degree \nof poor self-control, lack of judgment, and an intent to hide his relationship from \nappropriate authorities. His lack of financial control is troubling, and raises significant \ndoubts about his overall financial management decisions and personal financial \nresponsibility. I am not convinced Applicant is financially responsible or makes good \nfinancial decisions. No mitigation fully applies. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6\u00b6 2(a), 2(c), and 2(d), the ultimate determination of whether to grant \nnational security eligibility must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. Under the whole-person \nconcept, the administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security \nclearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process \nfactors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d). \n \nI considered all of the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my findings of fact \nand comments under Guidelines E and F, in my whole-person analysis. I also considered \nApplicant\u2019s long history of employment and security eligibility. However, his involvement \nin the fraudulent relationship, borrowing money to send to an unknown foreign person, \nbankrupting himself to continue the scheme, and continued participation even after being \nwarned about the scheme and after receiving the SOR in this case, shows a complete \nlack of awareness and judgment expected of a person entrusted with classified \ninformation. I remain unconvinced of his financial responsibility, good judgment, and \nability to resist further high-risk activity. \n \nAccordingly, I conclude Applicant has not carried his burden of showing that it is \nclearly consistent with the national security interests of the United States to grant him \neligibility for access to classified information. \n \n \n \n\n \n8 \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline E:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n  Subparagraphs 1.a - 1.d:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n   \nParagraph 2, Guideline F:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n  Subparagraph 2.a:  \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national security interests of the \nUnited States to grant Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nApplicant\u2019s security clearance is denied. \n \n \n   _______________________ \nGregg A.

Eligibility to continue working in a \npublic trust position is denied.   \nStatement of the Case \nOn May 4, 2018, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications Facility \n(DOD CAF) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant, detailing the \ntrustworthiness concerns under Guideline F, financial considerations, explaining why it was \nunable to find it clearly consistent with the national interest to grant him a position of trust. \nThe DOD CAF took the action under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, \nDefense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as \namended (Directive); and the Security Executive Agent Directive 4, effective June 8, 2017. \nOn May 21, 2018, Applicant answered the SOR, admitting the allegations, and \nrequesting a decision based on the administrative record instead of a hearing. On June 19, \n2018, Department Counsel prepared a File of Relevant Material (FORM). Applicant \n03/29/2019\n\n2 \n \nreceived a copy of the FORM on July 31, 2018, and was informed that he had through \nSeptember 14, 2018 to file a response. He did not file a response. The case was assigned \nto me on September 20, 2018.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \n Applicant is a 26-year-old single man with a high school diploma. He has been \nworking for a defense contractor as a water blaster since 2013. (Item 4 at 10) \n \n \nApplicant has been smoking marijuana approximately once every three months \nsince he was 20 years old. He did not disclose his marijuana use, as required on his 2016 \nSCA, explaining that he was worried that if he did so, he would lose his job. (Item 4 at 11)   \n \n \nApplicant continued to use marijuana for approximately 18 months after completing \nhis security clearance application. His last use was in December 2017. He has no intention \nof using marijuana in the future. (Item 4 at 2) \n \n \nPolicies \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a trustworthiness position, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative \njudge\u2019s overall adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. The \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, past \nand present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence \nto establish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant \nis responsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable trustworthiness determination. \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must consider the totality \nof an applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant circumstances in light of the nine adjudicative \nprocess factors in AG \u00b6 2(d).1  \n                                                 \n1 The factors under AG \u00b6 2(d) are as follows: \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the \nconduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the \n\n3 \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline H, Drug Involvement and Substance Abuse \n \n \nThe trustworthiness concerns under this guideline are set forth in AG \u00b6 18: \n \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of prescription \nand non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances that cause \nphysical or mental impairment or are used in a manner inconsistent with their \nintended purpose can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability and \ntrustworthiness, both because such behavior may lead to physical or \npsychological impairment, and because it raises questions about a person\u2019s \nability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s history of marijuana use triggers the application of AG \u00b6 25(a), \u201cany \nsubstance misuse.\u201d The following mitigating condition under AG \u00b6 26 is potentially \napplicable: \n \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and substance \nmisuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and \nhas established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not limited to: \n \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs are \nused; and \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all \ndrug involvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that \nany future involvement or misuse is grounds for revocation of \nnational security eligibility. \n \n  \nApplicant contends he will never use marijuana again. However, he did not \nmemorialize his intent not to use it again in a signed, sworn statement. Moreover, he \nprovided no information about whether he will disassociate himself from his marijuana-\nusing friend, or whether he will avoid the environment where marijuana is used. \nConsequently, AG \u00b6 26(b) is only applicable insofar as he acknowledged his history of \nmarijuana use and expressed an intent not to use in the future. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s last use of marijuana was in December 2017, 18 months after he \ncompleted SCA. Under these circumstances, it is too soon to conclude that his \n                                                                                                                                                             \nconduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other \npermanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for \npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or \nrecurrence. \n \n\n4 \n \nhistory of marijuana use no longer poses a trustworthiness concern. Applicant failed \nto mitigate the trustworthiness concern. \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \n \n \nUnder this guideline, \u201c[c]onduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, \ndishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions about \nan individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified or sensitive \ninformation.\u201d Applicant\u2019s falsification of his 2016 SCA triggers the application of AG \u00b6 16(a), \n\u201cdeliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from any personnel \nsecurity questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar form used to conduct \ninvestigations, determine employment qualifications, award benefits or status, determine \nnational security eligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities.\u201d \n \n \nApplicant falsified his SCA because he was afraid he would lose his job if his \nemployer discovered he had been using marijuana. Intentionally omitting or falsifying \nrelevant information to conceal derogatory information from a trustworthiness application \nout of fear of losing one\u2019s job does not mitigate falsification.  None of the mitigating \nconditions apply. Applicant has failed to mitigate the personal conduct trustworthiness \nconcern. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nI considered the whole-person concept factors in my analysis of the disqualifying \nand mitigating conditions, and they do not warrant a favorable conclusion. \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings for against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline H:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \n \n \nAGAINST Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraphs 2.a \u2013 2.b:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n5 \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the interests of the United States to grant Applicant eligibility for a \nposition of trust. Eligibility for a position of trust is denied. \n \n \n_____________________ \nMarc E. Curry \nAdministrative Judge \n",

Nagel, Esq., Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Ryan C. Nerney, Esq.   \n \n \n08/29/2019 \n______________ \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \n \n \nLEONARD, Michael H., Administrative Judge: \n \nApplicant contests the Defense Department\u2019s intent to deny his eligibility for \naccess to classified information. The conditions that resulted in his financial problems \nwere largely beyond his control, and he acted responsibly under the circumstances. He \nhas also initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay his delinquent debts. \nThe evidence is sufficient to mitigate his history of financial problems. Accordingly, this \ncase is decided for Applicant.    \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nApplicant completed and submitted a Standard Form (SF) 86, Questionnaire for \nNational Security Positions, the official form used for personnel security investigations, \non May 1, 2016. (Exhibit 2) This document is commonly known as a security clearance \napplication. Thereafter, on March 22, 2018, after reviewing the application and the \ninformation gathered during a background investigation, the Department of Defense \nConsolidated Adjudications Facility, Fort Meade, Maryland, sent Applicant a statement \nof reasons (SOR), explaining it was unable to find that it was clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant him eligibility for access to classified information. The SOR is \n\n \n2 \n \nsimilar to a complaint. It detailed the factual reasons for the action under the security \nguideline known as Guideline F for financial considerations.  \n \nWith assistance of counsel, Applicant answered the SOR on April 30, 2018. \nAlthough his formal responses were \u201cadmit in part and deny in part,\u201d he essentially \nadmitted the six debts alleged and provided explanations and current information. His \nanswer consisted of a seven-page memorandum along with proposed Exhibits A-R. He \nrequested a hearing before an administrative judge.  \n  \nThe case was assigned to me on September 24, 2018. The hearing took place \non December 4, 2018. Applicant appeared with counsel. Department Counsel offered \ndocumentary exhibits, which were admitted as Exhibits 1-8. Applicant offered \ndocumentary exhibits, which were admitted as Exhibits A-X. Other than Applicant, no \nwitnesses were called. The hearing transcript (Tr.) was received on December 12, \n2018. \n \nThe record was kept open until December 14, 2018, to provide Applicant an \nopportunity to submit additional documentation in support of his case. Applicant made a \ntimely submission, and the three additional documents are admitted without objections \nas Exhibits Y, Z, and AA.     \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant is a 52-year-old employee who is seeking to retain a security \nclearance. He works as a consultant in the fields of proposal management, capture \nmanagement, and business development for various companies in the defense industry. \n(Tr. 18-19; Exhibit C) His formal education includes a bachelor\u2019s degree from a \nprestigious private university. He married in 1999, and he and his spouse have two \nteenage children from the marriage.  \n   \n \nThe SOR alleged and Applicant admitted a history of financial problems. In \naddition to his admissions, the six delinquent financial accounts in the SOR are \nestablished by the documentary evidence. (Exhibits 3-8) In particular, the SOR \nconcerns a past-due mortgage loan in the amount of $3,890 with a total balance of \n$948,215, and five charged-off accounts in the total amount of about $64,433. Three of \nthe charged-off accounts are credit card accounts, and two charged-off accounts are \nunsecured loans from peer-to-peer lending companies.   \n \nIn general, Applicant attributed his financial problems to circumstances \nsurrounding his wife\u2019s mental-health condition (bipolar disorder) in 2016, and a business \ndownturn in 2017 due to the transition of presidential administrations, leaving delays in \nlarge government procurement programs. His wife\u2019s mental-health condition is long-\nstanding; the first undiagnosed manic episode occurred in 2007-2008; and she was first \ndiagnosed with bipolar disorder and had court-ordered treatment in 2011. (Tr. 53-54) \nHer most recent manic episode was in 2016. Her condition has stabilized since the last \nepisode with no further incidents, and she remains under the care of a psychiatrist. (Tr. \n43-44) \n\n \n3 \n \nThe 2016 episode resulted in, among other things, Applicant and his wife \nentering into a written partial marital settlement agreement in April 2016. (Exhibit AA) \nThe agreement summarized the relevant circumstances surrounding his wife\u2019s mental-\nhealth condition as follows: \n \nWHEREAS, the Wife has been hospitalized several times during the \nparties\u2019 marriage which has resulted in periods of marital separation, and it \nappears that in order for the parties to continue their marriage and to \ncontinue to reside in the same residence and to protect the safety of the \nchildren, the parties have agreed that a marital agreement is necessary for \nthem to live together as husband and wife. Specifically, [Applicant\u2019s \nspouse] suffers from significant mental illness. To date, she has been \nhospitalized (involuntarily and/or voluntarily) four (4) times since 2011. \nThis includes four (4) court supervised hospitalizations and multiple court \nsupervised medical treatment plans. Manic attacks preceded each of \nthese hospitalizations, and local law enforcement/crisis prevention \nauthorities deemed her to be a possible danger to herself or others. In two \n(2) of these hospitalizations, different medical teams have diagnosed her \nas having Bi-polar disorder with manic tendencies. \n \nAs \npart \nof \nthe \nmania \nprocess, \n[Applicant\u2019s \nspouse] \nhas \ndamaged/attempted to destroy personal property belonging to her family. \nFor example, in 2011, she destroyed office equipment used by her \nhusband and attempted to give away family possessions (including \nvaluable jewelry). And in 2013, she locked out her husband and children \nfrom their family home during another manic attack. Also, on or about in \n2008/2009, she also locked out her husband from the family home until \nlocal law enforcement were able to gain access to the house for the \nhusband. \n \nDuring manic attacks, [Applicant\u2019s spouse] has shown disregard for the \nsafety of family financial assets. For example, in 2011 she wrote a check \nfor $100,000 on the family account which if cashed would have bounced. \nIn 2011, she also tried to give away assets of the family to realize a \ndelusional vision of good fortune. And in 2013, she emptied out joint bank \naccounts, which created a dangerous situation for the husband and \nchildren who were at that point outside the home area. (Exhibit AA at 1-2) \n \nAmong other things, Applicant and his wife agreed that he has sole legal and \nphysical custody of their minor children and his wife had liberal access to the children so \nlong as she remains in the marital home. His wife agreed to continue treatment, follow \nall doctor\u2019s recommendations, and take all prescribed medications. She also agreed to \nhave no further contact with a named paramour or any subsequent paramour and cease \nall contact, direct or indirect, with such persons. Applicant and his wife also agreed that \nthey will have one joint checking or savings account with a particular bank and all other \njoint accounts will be closed.  \n \n\n \n4 \n \nIrresponsible spending was a feature of Applicant\u2019s wife\u2019s manic episodes. The \nindebtedness reflected in the five charged-off accounts in the SOR stems from her \nirresponsible spending with three credit card accounts, spending to pay for medical care \nand treatment for her, or both. Applicant has taken steps to reduce the likelihood of \nrecurrence of a similar event. (Tr. 46-47) To address the irresponsible spending, \nApplicant and his wife have one joint account, which allows him to monitor ongoing cash \nflow, and he has taken her off of all his business accounts. (Tr. 48-50) Together, they \nhave three bank accounts with the same bank; she has her own checking account; they \nhave a joint account; and he has an account for household expenses. (Tr. 50) Most of \nthe money is in the household account, which she does not have access to while he has \naccess and transparency for all three accounts. (Tr. 50-51) In addition to the financial \naccounts, his spouse does not have access to matters related to his work in the defense \nindustry. (Tr. 63-64)  \n \nTurning to the delinquent debts in the SOR, the first concerns the past-due \nmortgage loan for a home in their state of current residence. Applicant fell behind on the \nloan due to a tenant defaulting on his rental obligation while Applicant and his family \nwere living and working in another state during 2014-2017. (Tr. 25-32) The tenant made \ntwo payments on a 24-month lease before defaulting and eventual eviction. In addition \nto the lack of a monthly rental payment, which was used to cover the mortgage \npayment, the tenant damaged the property to an extent that the cost to repair and \nrehabilitate the home was about $40,000.  \n \nIn April 2018, Applicant entered into a repayment plan agreement for the \nmortgage loan, which then was past due in the amount of $12,028, with a payment \nschedule calling for six monthly payments ending in September 2018. (Exhibit M)  \n \nIn October 2018, the mortgage lender agreed to extend the plan for another six \nmonths ending in March 2019. (Exhibit W) As of October 2018, the past-due amount \nwas $5,376.  \n \nA November 16, 2018 account statement reflects the following: (1) the amount \ndue on December 1, 2018, was $16,043; (2) the unpaid principal balance was \n$905,116; (3) past payments year-to-date include $12,994 in principal, $13,685 in \ninterest, $9,174 in escrow, and $2,668 in unapplied funds, for a total of $38,552; and (4) \nthe current amount due consisted of $1,463 in principal, $1,501 in interest, $1,127 in \nescrow for a monthly payment of $4,092, plus a past-due amount of $11,951. (Exhibit Z)  \n \nA December 8, 2018 account statement shows an unpaid principal balance of \n$903,661 with a past-due balance of $12,059. (Exhibit Y) Applicant anticipates the \nmortgage loan will be current by approximately March 2019. (Tr. 31) \n \nTurning next to the charged-off accounts, the $23,957 charged-off credit card \naccount was settled in 2017, when Applicant agreed to make two payments totaling \n$13,954, and a pending collection lawsuit against Applicant was dismissed with \nprejudice in early 2018. (Tr. 32-36; Exhibit N) \n \n\n \n5 \n \nThe $17,051 charged-off credit card account was settled in 2017, when Applicant \nagreed to make 12 monthly payments of $1,222 ending in October 2018 for a full \nsettlement amount of $14,675. (Tr. 36-37; Exhibits O and U) \n \nThe $13,323 charged-off unsecured loan was settled in 2018, when Applicant \nagreed to make three payments for a total of $4,000 ending in May 2018. (Tr. 38-39; \nExhibit P) \n \nThe $8,866 charged-off unsecured loan was resolved by a repayment \narrangement calling for $100 monthly payments beginning in October 2017. (Tr. 39-41; \nExhibits Q and V) The account has not been settled for a lesser amount, and Applicant \nintends to adhere to the payment arrangement until the account is paid.  \n \nThe $1,236 charged-off credit card account was settled in November 2017 for a \nlump-sum payment of $1,512, and a pending collection lawsuit against Applicant was \ndismissed with prejudice in early 2018. (Tr. 37-38; Exhibit R)   \n \nApplicant is a high-earner, averaging about $20,000 monthly in billable revenue. \n(Tr. 42)  A self-prepared financial statement shows the following: (1) monthly income of \n$15,000; (2) monthly expenses of $8,090; (3) monthly debt payments of $3,332; and (4) \na monthly net remainder of $3,578; and listed assets (excluding real estate) of \n$263,000. (Exhibits K and S) In addressing his indebtedness to recover from the 2016 \nincident, Applicant has followed a four-step plan: (1) relocating to their current home \nand state of residence in mid-2017, which resulted in a reduced cost-of-living; (2) \nfocusing on the key accounts to obtain settlements; (3) establishing a three-month \nfinancial reserve, which is still a work in progress; and (4) paying off their current debt \nby the spring of 2020, all of which would result in a full recovery. (Tr. 41-42) In addition \nto the above matters, Applicant had credit counseling from a consumer credit \ncounseling organization in April 2018. (Exhibit J)  \n \nLaw and Policies \n \n \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (E.O.) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of \nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review \nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the National Security \nAdjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information or \nEligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position (AG), effective June 8, 2017. \n \nIt is well-established law that no one has a right to a security clearance.1 As \nnoted by the Supreme Court in Department of the Navy v. Egan, \u201cthe clearly consistent \nstandard indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the \n                                                          \n1 Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988) (\u201cit should be obvious that no one has a \n\u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance\u201d); Duane v. Department of Defense, 275 F.3d 988, 994 (10th Cir. 2002) (no \nright to a security clearance).  \n \n\n \n6 \n \nside of denials.\u201d2 Under Egan, Executive Order 10865, and the Directive, any doubt \nabout whether an applicant should be allowed access to classified information will be \nresolved in favor of protecting national security. In Egan, the Supreme Court stated that \nthe burden of proof is less than a preponderance of evidence.3 The DOHA Appeal \nBoard has followed the Court\u2019s reasoning, and a judge\u2019s findings of fact are reviewed \nunder the substantial-evidence standard.4 \n \n \nThere is no presumption in favor of granting, renewing, or continuing eligibility for \naccess to classified information.5 Under the Directive, the parties have the following \nburdens: (1) Department Counsel has the burden of presenting evidence to establish \nfacts alleged in the SOR that have been controverted; (2) an applicant is responsible for \npresenting evidence to refute, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts that have been \nadmitted or proven; and (3) an applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain \na favorable clearance decision.6 \n \nDiscussion \n \n \nUnder Guideline F for financial considerations, the suitability of an applicant may \nbe questioned or put into doubt when that applicant has a history of excessive \nindebtedness or financial problems or difficulties. The overall concern is set forth in AG \n\u00b6 18 as follows: \n \nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. . . . \n \n \nThe concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified or sensitive information to obtain money or something else of \nvalue. It encompasses concerns about a person\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other \nimportant qualities. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified or sensitive \ninformation. \n \n \nIn analyzing the facts of this case, I considered the following disqualifying and \nmitigating conditions as most pertinent:  \n \n                                                          \n2 484 U.S. at 531. \n \n3 484 U.S. at 531. \n \n4 ISCR Case No. 01-20700 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002) (citations omitted).  \n \n5 ISCR Case No. 02-18663 (App. Bd. Mar. 23, 2004). \n \n6 Directive, Enclosure 3, \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.14 and E3.1.15. \n \n\n \n7 \n \nAG \u00b6 19(a) inability to satisfy debts;  \n \nAG \u00b6 19(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations;  \n \nAG \u00b6 20(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were \nlargely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce, or \nseparation, clear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity \ntheft), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; and \n \nAG \u00b6 20(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to \nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.  \n \n \nThe evidence supports a conclusion that Applicant has a history of financial \nproblems that is sufficient to raise a security concern under Guideline F. The \ndisqualifying conditions noted above apply to this case.  \n \n \nTurning to the matters in mitigation, Applicant\u2019s financial problems are due to a \ncombination of factors: (1) his wife\u2019s last manic episode in 2016, her related \nirresponsible spending, and expenses for her care and treatment; (2) the business \ndownturn in 2017; and (3) the tenant who defaulted on the lease and damaged their \nhome while they were living and working in another state. Those circumstances were \nlargely beyond his control. Applicant acted responsibly under the circumstances, as \nevidenced by the remedial actions taken in 2017 and 2018 to address his indebtedness. \nHe also acted responsibly by taking steps to rehabilitate his marriage and care for his \nspouse, protect his minor children, and prevent his spouse from engaging in further \nirresponsible spending. Given the circumstances, the mitigating condition at AG \u00b6 20(b) \napplies in Applicant\u2019s favor.   \n \n \nApplicant has initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to resolve his \nindebtedness. He receives substantial credit for addressing all the debts in the SOR. \nThe past-due mortgage loan is still past due, but Applicant has paid tens of thousands \nof dollars on the loan during 2017-2018, and he anticipates being current on the loan by \nMarch 2019. He also paid a total of $34,141 to settle four of the five charged-off \naccounts, and he is making monthly payments per a repayment arrangement for the \nother. Moreover, it does not appear that Applicant was slow to act. He has being \nworking on these matters since the mid-2017 relocation to his state of current \nresidence. Given the circumstances, the mitigating condition at AG \u00b6 20(d) applies in \nApplicant\u2019s favor. \n \n \nApplicant presented a good but less than perfect case in mitigation, but, as in all \nhuman affairs, perfection is not the standard. A security clearance case is not a debt-\ncollection procedure. It is a procedure designed to evaluate an applicant\u2019s judgment, \nreliability, and trustworthiness. See ISCR Case No. 09-02160 (App. Bd. Jun. 21, 2010). \nAn applicant is not required, as a matter of law, to establish resolution of every debt \nalleged in the SOR. An applicant need only establish a plan to resolve the financial \nproblems and take significant actions to implement the plan. There is no requirement \n\n \n8 \n \nthat an applicant make payments on all the delinquent debts simultaneously, nor is \nthere a requirement that the debts alleged in the SOR be paid first. See ISCR Case No. \n07-06482 at 2-3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008). \n \n \nHere, I am persuaded that Applicant is making an honest effort to be financially \nresponsible and repay his creditors. He\u2019s not running from or avoiding his debts. There \nare clear indications that he is repaying his creditors, and his financial problems appear \nto be under control. With additional time coupled with his ability as a high-earner, it is \nprobable that he will continue to make the required mortgage loan payments and \nadhere to the repayment arrangement for the unresolved charged-off account. It is also \nprobable that he will meet his financial goal of full recovery by spring 2020. Taking \neverything into account, Applicant demonstrated good judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness by persevering under difficult and trying circumstances that were largely \nbeyond his control. The financial considerations concern is mitigated.  \n \n \nFollowing Egan and the clearly consistent standard, I have no doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, good judgment, and ability to protect classified or \nsensitive information. In reaching this conclusion, I weighed the evidence as a whole \nand considered if the favorable evidence outweighed the unfavorable evidence or vice \nversa. I also considered the whole-person concept. I conclude that he met his ultimate \nburden of persuasion to show that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to \ngrant him eligibility for access to classified information.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nThe formal findings on the SOR allegations are: \n \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nFor Applicant  \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a--1.f: \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIt is clearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant Applicant \neligibility for access to classified information.

Edmunds. Esq. \n     11/08/2019 \n______________ \nDecision \n______________ \nMASON, Paul J., Administrative Judge: \nApplicant exercised seriously poor judgment by misusing a controlled substance \nto curb her appetite so that she could become pregnant. However, the passage of time \nand her credible medical evidence in mitigation is sufficient to overcome the remaining \nsecurity concerns raised by the guideline for drug involvement and substance misuse. \nEligibility for classified information is granted. \nStatement of Case \nOn June 30, 2016, Applicant certified and signed an Electronic Questionnaires \nfor Investigations Processing (e-QIP) to obtain a security clearance required for \nemployment with a defense contractor. On October 7, 2016, Applicant provided a \nsummary interview (PSI) to an investigator from the Office Personnel Management \n(OPM). After examining the background investigation and PSI, the Department of \nDefense (DOD) could not make the affirmative findings to issue a security clearance. \nOn March 1, 2018, DOD issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing \nsecurity concerns under misuse of prescription drugs (Guideline H, \u00b6 1) and personal \nconduct (Guideline E, \u00b6 2). The action was taken under Executive Order (E.O.) 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; \n\n \n  2 \n \nDOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review \nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and Security Executive Agent \nDirective 4, establishing in Appendix A the National Security Adjudicative Guidelines for \nDetermining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information or Eligibility to Hold a \nSensitive Position (AGs), made effective in the DOD on June 8, 2017.  \n \n \nApplicant answered the SOR on March 14, 2018, and requested a hearing. I was \nassigned the case on July 28, 2018. On March 28, 2019, the Defense Office of \nHearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a notice of hearing for April 15, 2019. The \nGovernment\u2019s two exhibits and Applicant\u2019s 15 exhibits were admitted without objection. \nOn April 30, 2019, DOHA received a copy of the transcript (Tr.); the record closed the \nsame day.  \n \nRulings on Evidence \n \n \nBefore opening statement, the Government moved to withdraw \u00b6 2 (Guideline E) \nof SOR. The motion was granted. (Tr. 5) \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn Applicant\u2019s answer to the SOR, she admitted misuse of prescription drugs as \nalleged under \u00b6 1.a.  \n \n \nApplicant is 38 years old. She married in May 2015 and gave birth to a daughter \non August 26, 2017. She has owned her home since March 2011. In May 2003, \nApplicant received a bachelor\u2019s degree in history; in August 2004, she earned a \nmaster\u2019s degree in cultural studies; and in May 2009, she was awarded a law degree. \nFrom 2009 to September 2010, she clerked for a federal district court judge. She was a \nlaw firm associate for three years before landing her current job in 2014 where she is \npresently a senior contract attorney. She is a member of two state bars. Applicant has \nnever been investigated or held a security clearance. She has no criminal record and \nthe only drug she has used in her life is Adderall. (GE 1 at 9-14, 22, 69, 72; GE 2 at 16; \nAE B; AE C; AE F; AE G; AE N at 2-3; AE O) \n \n \nIn her October 2016 PSI, Applicant indicated she used Adderall about two times \na month beginning in January 2016, when she was 34 years old. The controlled \nsubstance was prescribed to her brother for his attention deficit disorder. She began \ntaking the drug to curb her appetite. She indicated that the drug never had an adverse \neffect on her judgment, her work, or her finances. She informed the OPM investigator \nthat she intended to continue using the drug unless required to stop to obtain a security \nclearance. (GE 2 at 16) \n \n \nIn her interrogatory answers dated and notarized on February 9, 2018, Applicant \nnoted several minor changes in her October 2016 PSI. She then disclosed that her \n\n \n  3 \n \ndaughter was born in August 2017. She also indicated that she used Adderall about 30 \ntimes from January 2016 to February 9, 2018. (GE 2 at 1-5, 16)  \n \n \nThough not mentioned in her October 2016 PSI or her February 2018 \ninterrogatory answers, she informed a licensed clinical social worker (LCSW) in April \n2019 that during her pregnancy and nursing of her daughter from December 2016 to \napproximately February 2018, she used no Adderall. (AE N at 2-3) \n \n \nThe LCSW conducted a full evaluation of Applicant in April 2019. For part of the \nevaluation, she administered the drug assessment screening test (DAST) to Applicant. \nShe conducted an examination using the 11-point screening criteria of Diagnostic and \nStatistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5). She conducted a mental status exam \nfollowed by a clinical interview. After referencing the AGs for security clearance \neligibility and reviewing the pertinent sections of the DSM-5, the LCSW diagnosed \nApplicant as having no substance abuse disorder. (AE N at 1-4) \n \n \nAt the hearing, Applicant explained that her obesity was the reason she started \nusing Adderall in January 2016. Over the next several months, she lost 70 pounds and \nbecame pregnant in December 2016. She indicated that she did not use Adderall during \nher pregnancy (December 2016 to August 2017) and while she was nursing her \ndaughter for the next four months. Applicant resumed her Adderall use in January 2018 \nbecause she wanted to lose weight again, a decision she regrets. She discontinued use \nin February 2018 \u201cbecause that\u2019s when I received the Government\u2019s Statement of \nReasons.\u201d (Tr. 33) (She is mistaken as the SOR was not issued until March 1, 2018.) \nApplicant did not know the drug was a controlled substance until a later date. (SOR; Tr. \n22-28; 33) \n \nThe circumstances in Applicant\u2019s life have changed since the birth and nursing of \nher daughter. She is no longer trying to lose weight to achieve pregnancy. She pledged \nnot to use Adderall or another person\u2019s prescription drugs in the future. Applicant\u2019s six \ndrug tests from October 2018 through March 2019 registered negative results. On \nDecember 11, 2018, she signed a statement of intent to abstain from future misuse of \nprescription drugs, realizing that future misuse of prescription medication is grounds for \nrevocation of national security eligibility. (Tr. 22-28; AE L; AE M) \n \n \nIn November 2018, Applicant\u2019s treating psychiatrist recalled that that she told him \nin August 2016 she was using Adderall though he was unable to conclude \u201cduring that \ntime\u201d or \u201csince that time\u201d that she was addicted to the drug. Applicant\u2019s weight loss \ndoctor, who she has been consulting occasionally for four years, discouraged her from \nusing Adderall. She has never tried to obtain a prescription for the drug from a medical \nprofessional. She has had some success with other prescribed weight-loss drugs, but \nstopped using one of those drugs because of the risk of birth defects. (Tr. 31-33, 35-38; \nAE K) \n \n\n \n  4 \n \n \nApplicant selected Adderall to control her appetite because somehow she knew \nthe drug could subdue hunger desires and she was aware her brother had a \nprescription for the drug. She did not know if the drug had any side effects or a negative \ninfluence on her fertility. (Tr. 36-37, 42-43) \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s fear of not being granted a security clearance was one reason she \nstopped using Adderall. However, when she received the SOR labeling her a national \nsecurity concern, she knew she had to strengthen her resolve for continued abstinence \nfrom Adderall misuse or misuse of another\u2019s prescription drugs. (Tr. 37)   \n \nCharacter Evidence \n \nApplicant\u2019s colleague (Mr. R3) at her current employer testified that he has been \nworking with Applicant for three years. In his daily contact with her, he has found her to \nbe very professional and a trustworthy attorney. Applicant expressed her remorse to Mr. \nR3 for having used Adderall that was prescribed to her brother. She was trying to lose \nweight so that she could become pregnant. (Tr. 11-19)  \n \nApplicant submitted nine character references. A program manager (Mr. R1) has \nknown Applicant since 2011 because they worked together on government contracts at \na law firm until she accepted her present job in 2014. Applicant\u2019s professionalism and \ntrustworthiness is based on Mr. R1\u2019s regular interaction with her. Mr. R2 has known \nApplicant for nine years and believes that she is a diligent worker. Mr. R3, corporate \ncounsel who testified at the hearing, indicated that Applicant is involved in a \nneighborhood charity that provides scholarships to worthy candidates from the area. \n(AE H; AE J) \n \nMr. R4, a contractor, has known Applicant professionally and socially for four \nyears. He believes she is a knowledgeable member of the government contractor \ncommunity. Ms. R5 has known Applicant since they were in law school in 2006. Ms. R5 \nand Applicant have maintained friendship over the years. Mr. R6, an associate law \nschool professor, was a law clerk with Applicant in 2009. They have remained friends \nwith Mr. R6 and Applicant socializing often. (AE H) \n \nMr. R7, who has known Applicant for five years, worked with her for a period of \ntime at her current employer. He found her to be honest, dedicated, and a team player. \nMr. R8, currently a police officer, worked with Applicant at her employer\u2019s industrial \nsecurity office. He personally observed her trustworthiness and high caliber of her work \nproduct. (AE H) \n \nMrs. R9, a lawyer, has known Applicant since 2012, when Mrs. R9 was hired at a \ncontracts law firm, and Applicant was assigned to be her adviser. Applicant\u2019s mentoring \nhelped Mrs. R9 manage her time  more effectively and stimulate her professional \ndevelopment. Applicant is an honest person, a responsible wife, and attentive mother. \n\n \n  5 \n \n(AE H) None of the nine glowing character endorsements, not even the reference from \nMr. R3, make any reference to Applicant\u2019s misuse of prescription drugs.  \n \nPolicies \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines, which should be applied \nwith common sense and the general factors of the whole-person concept. The \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. The protection of the \nnational security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(d) requires that \u201c[a]ny doubt \nconcerning personnel being considered for national security eligibility will be resolved in \nfavor of the national security.\u201d  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . . .\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion in seeking a favorable security decision. \n \nAnalysis \n \nDrug Involvement and Substance Misuse \n \nThe security concern under the Drug Involvement/Substance Abuse Guideline is \nset forth in AG \u00b6 24: \n \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual's reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior \nmay lead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. Controlled substance means any \"controlled substance\" \nas defined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term \nadopted in this guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above. \n \nAG \u00b6 25. Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying \ninclude: \n \n(a) any substance misuse (see above definition). \n \nThe record evidence indicates that Applicant misused Adderall, a schedule II \ncontrolled substance (stimulant) as defined 21 United States Code (U.S.C.) 802. By \n\n \n  6 \n \nobtaining the drug that was prescribed to her brother for his attention deficit disorder, \nApplicant misused a legal drug in a manner inconsistent with the drug\u2019s intended \npurpose.  \n \nApplicant began misusing Adderall in January 2016 at a frequency of about twice \na month. After reporting her history of misuse during an October 2016 PSI, she \ninformed the OPM investigator that she would continue to misuse Adderall unless she \nwas required to stop to receive a security clearance.  \n \nApplicant continued to misuse Adderall until December 2016, when she became \npregnant. After the birth of her daughter in August 2017, and a four-month period of \nnursing, she resumed misuse of the drug in January 2018, and used the drug until \nFebruary 2018. AG \u00b6 25(a) applies.  \n \nAG \u00b6 26. Conditions that could mitigate security concerns include: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \nand \n \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this \nproblem, and has established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not \nlimited to: \n \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; \n \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; \nand \n \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that any future \ninvolvement or misuse is grounds for revocation of national security \neligibility; and \n \n(c) abuse of prescription drugs was after a severe or prolonged illness \nduring which these drugs were prescribed, and abuse has ended; and \n \n(d) satisfactory completion of a prescribed drug treatment program, \nincluding, but not limited to, rehabilitation and aftercare requirements, \nwithout recurrence of abuse, and a favorable prognosis by a duly qualified \nmedical professional. \n \n\n \n  7 \n \nAG \u00b6 26(a) applies in part because Applicant\u2019s substance misuse is unlikely to \nrecur. I find that Applicant no longer has a reason to use Adderall because she has \ngiven birth and knows that she can curb her appetite and weight with other prescription \ndrugs as she has in the past. Additionally, she did not know the drug was a controlled \nsubstance.  \n \nApplicant receives some mitigation from AG \u00b6 26(b) because she provided \ncredible testimony of her intention not to misuse prescription drugs in the future. Her \nintention is supported by her responsible decision to self-report her substance misuse to \nthe OPM investigator, her abstinence from substance misuse since February 2018, and \nher signed statement of intention to forego future misuse of prescription drugs.  \n \nAG \u00b6 26(c) applies in part because Applicant wanted to have a baby and her \nweight was preventing her procreation. Applicant does not receive full credit under the \ncondition because after she completed nursing she again used poor judgment in \nresuming misuse of Adderall.  \n \nWhile Applicant has not completed a substance abuse program, she did undergo \na comprehensive evaluation by a LCSW in April 2019. After administering a DAST, an \n11-point evaluation under the DSM-5, a mental health status exam, a clinical interview, \nand assessing the AGs for security clearance eligibility, the LCSW diagnosed Applicant \nas having no substance abuse disorder. AG \u00b6 26(d) applies in part. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \nI \nhave \nexamined \nthe \nevidence \nunder \nthe \nguideline \nfor \ndrug \ninvolvement/substance misuse in the context of the nine general factors of the whole-\nperson concept listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for \naccess to classified information must be an overall common-sense judgment based \nupon careful consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \n  \nApplicant provided positive evidence that weighs in her favor. She is 38 years \nold. She has been married for four years and has a young daughter. She has a \nbachelor\u2019s degree, a master\u2019s degree, and a law degree. Since her graduation from law \n\n \n  8 \n \nschool, she has developed a respected reputation from former and current coworkers \nfor her intelligence, team player attitude and professionalism.  \n \nWhen Applicant was interviewed by the OPM investigator in October 2016, she \nexercised good judgment by volunteering her Adderall use before being questioned \nabout any drug abuse or misuse. But then she displayed poor judgment by announcing \nthat she planned to continue using the drug unless the use prevented her from receiving \na security clearance. Even though she did not know the drug was a controlled \nsubstance, she knew (at ages 34-36) that she was misusing a drug prescribed to her \nbrother. She continued using the drug until she became pregnant in December 2016, \nand resumed use for a short period in early 2018, after a four months of nursing. \n \nJudging by the totality of all the evidence, Applicant\u2019s fear of not receiving \nsecurity clearance eligibility was a critical consideration in her decision to stop using \nAdderall. However, her subsequent understanding of the drug\u2019s classification as a \ncontrolled substance, along with the impropriety of using another person\u2019s prescription \ndrugs, were two other factors that caused her to stop. I find that there has been no use \nof this drug since February 2018. In April 2019, following a complete diagnostic \nevaluation encompassing alcohol tests, and a clinical interview, the LCSW found no \nsubstance abuse disorder that is recognized by the DSM-5. Considering the evidence \nas a whole, particularly the favorable character and medical evidence, Applicant has \novercome the security concerns raised by the guideline for drug involvement and \nsubstance abuse. \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline H:  \n \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \n \n \nWITHDRAWN \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with the national security interests of the United States to grant \nApplicant eligibility for access to classified information. Eligibility for access to classified \ninformation is granted.  \n \n___________ \nPaul J. Mason \nAdministrative Judge \n",

In addition, the Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining \nEligibility for Access to Classified Information (AG), effective within the Defense Department on June 8, \n2017. \n \n\n \n2 \n \n \nThe case was assigned to me on January 24, 2019. The hearing was held as \nscheduled on April 5, 2019. After the hearing and receipt of the transcript, I proposed to \nthe parties that this case was appropriate for a summary disposition in Applicant\u2019s favor.  \nDepartment Counsel had 10 days to consider the matter and provide written notice that \nDepartment Counsel did or did not object to the summary disposition. On April 29, 2019, \nDepartment Counsel forwarded an e-mail to the parties, indicating they had no objection \nto the summary disposition.   \n \nThe SOR consisted of two allegations. SOR 1.a alleged Applicant\u2019s grandmother \nis a citizen and resident of Syria. SOR 1.b alleged Appellant\u2019s father-in-law is a citizen \nand resident of Syria. She admitted both allegations.  \n \nApplicant has worked for a DOD contractor and has held a security clearance \nsince July 2013 without incident. Her co-workers attest to her excellent work ethic and \nthe positive contributions that she makes to the work environment. (AE A; AE B; AE E) \n \nApplicant\u2019s parents immigrated to the United States in the late 1980s and \nbecame U.S. citizens in 1991. Their two children, Applicant and her brother, were born, \nraised, and educated in the United States. Applicant\u2019s parents both served as DOD \ncontractors and have been granted security clearances in the past. After 9-11, her \nfather volunteered to deploy to Iraq in 2003. He served as a linguist and cultural advisor \nto several of the top generals for 22 months. Her father is currently a DOD contractor \nand holds a top secret clearance. (Tr. 20-38; AE D) \n \n \nApplicant met her husband in the United States. He attended medical school in \nSyria, but moved to the United States in 2011 to complete his residency. At present, he \npractices medicine in United States. He became a U.S. permanent resident in February \n2018 and intends to apply for U.S. citizenship when he is eligible. They married in \nOctober 2016, and Applicant recently gave birth to their first child, a son. They intend to \nlive in the United States. Their financial assets are located in the United States. \nApplicant votes in the United States. (Tr. 40-43, 66-78; Gov 2) \n \nSOR 1.a:  Applicant has limited contact with her grandmother because her \ngrandmother does not speak English and Applicant is not fluent in Arabic. She has \ncontact with her a few times a year during the holidays such as Christmas and Easter. \nFrom 1994 to 2015, her grandmother was a permanent resident in the United States. In \n2013, she returned to Syria to sell some property.  Her chronic illness worsened and \nshe became too ill to travel to the United States. As a result, her permanent residency \nexpired. Her grandmother is 83. She has a 24-hour caregiver and cannot feed herself. \nShe has never worked outside the home. (Tr. 27-30; 69) \n \nSOR 1.b: Applicant has met her father-in-law but has limited interaction with him \nbecause of the language barrier. Applicant\u2019s father-in-law currently lives part of the year \nin Syria and part of the year in the United States.  He is 78. He served in the military as \na result of a military draft.  He retired in January 2001.  His wife passed away in \nSeptember 2001.  He has five sons. Applicant\u2019s husband is the youngest. Three of his \n\n \n3 \n \n \nolder sons are medical doctors. Two work and reside in the United States with their \nfamilies and are U.S. citizens. His eldest son practices medicine in Canada. He and his \nfamily are French and Canadian citizens. He and his family recently moved to the U.S \nbecause he accepted a research position.  Another son resides in Germany with his \nfamily.  He owns a restaurant in Syria. He hired someone to oversee the restaurant in \nSyria. He travels to Syria several times a year to check up on the restaurant. He would \nlike to open a restaurant in Germany. (Tr. 45-63) \n \nBetween 2003 and 2014, Applicant\u2019s father-in-law visited his sons in the U.S. for \nextended periods.  He became a permanent resident of the U.S. in March 2018.  He is \nin the process of selling his property in Syria and will move to the United States to live \nwith his family once the sale of the property is complete. At the time of the hearing, he \nwas living with one of his son\u2019s in the United States. (Tr. 48-56; AE G) \n \n \nWhile Guideline B security concerns were appropriately raised related to \nApplicant\u2019s relatives who are citizens of and reside in Syria, the concerns are mitigated  \nbased on Applicant\u2019s longstanding connection to the United States.  In reaching this \nconclusion, I weighed the evidence as a whole and concluded the favorable evidence \noutweighed the unfavorable evidence. I also considered the factors under the whole-\nperson concept. I conclude Applicant met her ultimate burden to show that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant her eligibility for access to classified \ninformation. \n \nThe concerns over Applicant\u2019s family members living and residing in Syria do not \ncreate doubt about her current reliability, trustworthiness, good judgment, and ability to \nprotect classified information. In reaching this conclusion, I weighed the evidence as a \nwhole and considered if the favorable evidence outweighed the unfavorable evidence or \nvice versa. I also gave due consideration to the whole-person concept. Accordingly, I \nconclude that Applicant met her ultimate burden of persuasion to show that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant her eligibility for access to classified \ninformation. This case is decided for Applicant.  \n \n \n \n \nErin C. Hogan \nAdministrative Judge \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n",

In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n                                                          \n5 Tr. at 23-27; AE L. \n \n6 Tr. at 27-46; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 2, 4; AE A-K, M-O. \n \n7 Tr. at 17-19, 45; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 3; AE F. \n\n \n4 \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.  \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18:       \n \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds.  \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n5 \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case:   \n \n(a) inability to satisfy debts;  \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \n \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired. \n \nApplicant has a history of financial problems, including unpaid taxes, judgments, \nand delinquent debts. The evidence is sufficient to raise the above disqualifying \nconditions.  \n \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c and 1.e are duplicate accounts. SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.h and 1.k are also \nduplicate accounts. When the same conduct is alleged twice in the SOR under the \nsame guideline, one of the duplicative allegations should be resolved in Applicant\u2019s \nfavor. See ISCR Case No. 03-04704 at 3 (App. Bd. Sep. 21, 2005). SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.e and 1.h \nare concluded for Applicant. \n \n  \nConditions that could mitigate the financial considerations security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 20. The following are potentially applicable:  \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment;  \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts;  \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue; and \n \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax \nauthority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \n \n\n \n6 \n \n \nApplicant attributed his financial problems primarily to his wife losing her job in \n2013. His mother and a sibling both passed away within the last four years. He also \nadmitted that he \u201cwas not watching the shop as closely as [he] should have and things \ngot out of hand.\u201d  \n \n \nAll of the non-tax debts are in payment plans or otherwise resolved. While he still \nowes an extensive amount on all of those debts, I believe he will continue to address \nthose debts, and they are mitigated. However, his tax problems precede his wife losing \nher job and the tragic loss of his mother and sibling. He owes the IRS more than \n$116,000 for tax years 2010 through 2015.  \n \n \nFailure to comply with tax laws suggests that an applicant has a problem with \nabiding by well-established government rules and systems. Voluntary compliance with \nrules and systems is essential for protecting classified information. See, e.g., ISCR \nCase No. 16-01726 at 5 (App. Bd. Feb. 28, 2018). A person who fails repeatedly to fulfill \nhis or her legal obligations, such as paying taxes when due, does not demonstrate the \nhigh degree of good judgment and reliability required of those granted access to \nclassified information. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 17-01382 at 4 (App. Bd. May 16, \n2018).  \n \nThere is insufficient evidence for a determination that Applicant\u2019s tax problems \nwill be resolved within a reasonable period. I am unable to find that he acted responsibly \nunder the circumstances. His financial issues are recent and ongoing. They continue to \ncast doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. I find that the \nsecurity concerns arising out of Applicant\u2019s unpaid taxes are not mitigated. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the \npotentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and \ncircumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \n\n \n7 \n \nGuideline F in my whole-person analysis. I also considered Applicant\u2019s honorable \nmilitary service and his long tenure as an employee of defense contractors. \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude Applicant did not \nmitigate the financial considerations security concerns.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.k: \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIt is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for \na security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n \n________________________ \nEdward W. Loughran \nAdministrative Judge \n",
