This is his first time applying for a security clearance. He is single and has two adult children. (Item 4) The SOR alleged that Applicant failed to timely file his federal income tax returns for tax years 2019 and 2020 (SOR \u00b6 1.a: Item 4 at 34; Item 5); he failed to timely file his state tax returns for tax years 2019 and 2020 (SOR \u00b6 1.b: Item 4 at 34; Item 5); and he owes the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) approximately $5,945 in delinquent taxes. (SOR \u00b6 1.c: Item 5 at 25) In his SOR answer, Applicant admits to all SOR allegations. (Item 2) On his security clearance application dated December 16, 2021, Applicant listed that he failed to file his 2019 federal income tax returns.

On April 5, 2023, the Defense Counterintelligence and Security Agency \nConsolidated Adjudication Services (DCSA CAS) sent him a Statement of Reasons \n(SOR) alleging security concerns under Guideline F. The CAS acted under Executive \nOrder (EO) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, \n1960), as amended; Department of Defense (DOD) Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial \nPersonnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended \n(Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) implemented by the DOD on June 8, \n2017. \nApplicant timely answered the SOR on date uncertain, and requested a decision \nbased on the written record in lieu of a hearing. On May 18, 2023, the Government sent \nApplicant a complete copy of its written case, a file of relevant material (FORM), including \npleadings and evidentiary documents identified as Items 1 through 6. He was given an \nopportunity to submit a documentary response setting forth objections, rebuttal, \nextenuation, mitigation, or explanation to the Government\u2019s evidence.

Items \n4 through 6 are admitted into evidence. Applicant\u2019s Response to Form is part of the \nrecord. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant, age 44, is an employee of a DOD contractor seeking to obtain a security \nclearance. He has worked for the same employer since October 2021. This is his first \ntime applying for a security clearance. He is single and has two adult children. (Item 4) \nThe SOR alleged that Applicant failed to timely file his federal income tax returns \nfor tax years 2019 and 2020 (SOR \u00b6 1.a: Item 4 at 34; Item 5); he failed to timely file his \nstate tax returns for tax years 2019 and 2020 (SOR \u00b6 1.b: Item 4 at 34; Item 5); and he \nowes the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) approximately $5,945 in delinquent taxes. \n(SOR \u00b6 1.c: Item 5 at 25) In his SOR answer, Applicant admits to all SOR allegations. \n(Item 2) \nOn his security clearance application dated December 16, 2021, Applicant listed \nthat he failed to file his 2019 federal income tax returns. The reason for not filing was due \nto procrastination. He mentioned that he was working with a new tax agent to resolve and \nbring current all necessary taxes. (Item 4 at 34) In Response to Interrogatories, dated \nAugust 25, 2022, Applicant discovered he did not file federal and state income tax returns \nfor tax years 2019 and 2020. He mentioned he was unable to file his income tax returns \nbecause he had COVID-19. A tax professional was currently working on his tax issues. \nHe also provided documentation indicating he owed the IRS, $5,945 in delinquent taxes. \nIn February 2023, he applied for an installment agreement with the IRS. He paid the IRS \n$3,000 up front in conjunction with this installment agreement application. (Item 5) \nApplicant indicated that he understands the importance of filing his taxes and \nadmits he failed to file his tax returns for 2019 and 2020. In the future, he intends to file \nhis tax returns in a timely manner unless a natural disaster or illness prevents him from \nfiling his tax returns. He understands the importance of timely filing his income tax returns \nand is aware that failure to do so may affect his eligibility for a security clearance. He \nmentioned that he filed his taxes for 2021 and hired a tax professional to help with his \n2019 and 2020 income tax returns. (Item 5 at 8) \nThe state tax board where Applicant works and resides provided a statement dated \nFebruary 15, 2023, indicating Applicant filed state tax returns for 2018, 2021, and 2022 \nand that he has no liability or pending assessments for those years. He did not file state \nincome tax returns for tax year 2019 and 2020.

He did not owe \nfederal income taxes for tax year 2020. Both federal income tax returns were received by \nthe IRS before the date of the SOR. (Item 3) \nIn his Response to the FORM, Applicant states he was unable to file his federal \nand state income tax returns because he was ill with COVID 19. He had a severe case of \nCOVID and struggled to survive. He was working with tax professionals to file his returns. \nHis first tax professional passed away. In February 2022, he hired another tax \nprofessional who did nothing for him. Applicant then hired another tax professional who \nwas reliable and filed his federal income tax returns and then his state income tax returns. \nApplicant provided a statement from his state tax board, dated June 19, 2023, which \nindicated he filed state income tax returns for tax years 2019, 2020, 2021 and 2022 and \nhe does not have pending assessments for those tax years. (Response to FORM; Item 5 \nat 7) \nRegarding his installment agreement for delinquent taxes, Applicant mentions that \nhe paid $3,000 on February 3, 2023, at the beginning of the installment agreement. (Item \n5 at 26) After this occurred, he received an unexpected monetary bonus from his \nemployer. He applied the bonus towards his remaining Federal tax debt. Applicant paid \nthe IRS $4,338 on May 31, 2023. He provided a receipt showing proof of payment. The \nreceipt revealed that the installment agreement related to tax year 2017. In the future, \nApplicant intends to file all federal and state income tax returns in a timely manner. \n(Response to FORM) \nPolicies \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d (Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988)). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d (Egan at 527). \nThe President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant \napplicants eligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d (EO 10865 \u00a7 2) \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the AG. These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, \nrecognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge applies these \nguidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative \njudge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available and reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d (EO 10865 \u00a7 \n7). Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant has \nnot met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established \nfor issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. (Egan, 484 U.S. at 531). \u201cSubstantial \nevidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d (See v. Washington \nMetro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994)). The guidelines presume a \nnexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria listed \ntherein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. ISCR Case No. 15-01253 at 3 (App. Bd. \nApr. 20, 2016). Once the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. (Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15). An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, \nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. (ISCR Case No. 02-31154 \nat 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005)) \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d (ISCR Case No. 01-\n20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002)). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d (Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; AG \u00b6 2(b)) \nAnalysis \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nThe concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified information to raise money. It encompasses concerns about a \nperson\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting classified \ninformation. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information. (ISCR \nCase No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \nAG \u00b6 19 notes several disqualifying conditions that could raise security concerns. \nThe disqualifying conditions that are relevant to Applicant\u2019s case include: \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired. \nAG \u00b6 19(f) is the applicable disqualifying factor regarding Applicant\u2019s failure to file \nfederal and state income tax returns for tax years 2019 and 2020. AG \u00b6 19(f) also applies \nregarding Applicant\u2019s $5,945 federal income tax debt as alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.c. \nAG \u00b6 20 describes conditions that could mitigate security concerns. The following \nare potentially applicable in this case: \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority \nto file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \nAG \u00b6 20(b) applies because Applicant suffered a serious case of COVID in 2020 \nwhich prevented him from filing his 2019 and 2020 income tax returns. Once his health \nimproved. He hired a tax professional to help with him file the 2019 and 2020 federal and \nstate income tax returns. It took longer than expected because his first tax professional \npassed away. The second tax professional did nothing to help him so he retained a third \ntax professional who was finally able to help with filing his tax returns. Based on what he \nencountered, Applicant acted responsibly under the circumstances. I also note that he \nfiled his 2021 and 2022 income tax returns. \nAG \u00b6 20(d) applies because Applicant initiated a good-faith effort to resolve his tax \ndebts. It took some time, but he diligently pursued resolving his tax situation. All \ndelinquent taxes are resolved. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(g) applies because Applicant filed his federal and state income tax returns \nfor 2019 and 2020. He entered into an installment agreement with the IRS to resolve his \ndelinquent tax debts. He paid $3,000 towards the debt initially in February 2023. On May \n31, 2023, he was able to resolve tax debt in full when he received a bonus from his \nemployer. \nApplicant bears the burden of production and persuasion in mitigation. He \nsuccessfully met this burden, by filing his state and federal income tax returns for 2019 \nand 2020 and resolving his delinquent tax debt. Applicant worked on resolving his tax \nissues for several years. The first two tax professionals did not work out for Applicant. He \nfinally found a tax professional who assisted him with filing his federal and state income \ntax returns for 2019 and 2020. He timely filed his federal and state income tax returns for \ntax years 2021 and 2022. He resolved his delinquent tax debt. Applicant mitigated the \nconcerns raised under Financial Considerations. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether the granting or continuing \nof national security eligibility is clearly consistent with the interests of national security \nmust be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful consideration of the \nadjudicative guidelines, each of which is to be evaluated in the context of the whole \nperson. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process factors \nlisted at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nI have incorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis, \nand I have considered the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). After weighing the disqualifying and \nmitigating conditions under Guideline F, and evaluating all the evidence in the context of \nthe whole person, I conclude that Applicant has mitigated the security concerns raised \nunder financial considerations. Applicant is fully aware that he must timely file all state \nand federal income tax returns. He is aware that failure to timely file his federal; and state \nincome tax returns will result in the loss of his security clearance. Accordingly, Applicant \nhas carried his burden of showing that it is clearly consistent with the interests of national \nsecurity to grant him eligibility for access to classified information. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required by Section \nE3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:   \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.c:  \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nI conclude that it is clearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant \nApplicant eligibility for access to classified information.

The case was \nassigned to me on November 9, 2023. \nAdministrative Notice \nDepartment Counsel requested that I take administrative notice of relevant facts \nabout the Philippines, based on the U.S. Department of State, Philippines Travel \nAdvisory, October 5, 2022; and various country reports on terrorism for the years 2020, \n2021, and 2022. I have taken notice as requested. In addition, I have sua sponte taken \nadministrative notice of the facts set out in the U.S. Department of State Bilateral Fact \nSheet, dated February 23, 2023, regarding the relations between the United States and \nthe Philippines. The facts administratively noticed are set out below in my findings of fact. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant is a 48-year-old systems engineer employed by a defense contractor \nsince January 2006. He received a security clearance in December 2013. (FORM Item 4) \nHe is a native-born U.S. citizen. In January 2000, he married a naturalized U.S. citizen \nwho was born in the Philippines, and they have two children, ages 16 and 12, who were \nborn in the United States. \nApplicant\u2019s father-in-law and mother-in-law are citizens and residents of the \nPhilippines. His father-in-law is self-employed in an engineering and trading business. \nThe record does not reflect the occupation, if any, of his mother-in-law. His brother-in-law \nis a dual U.S.-Philippine citizen, residing in the Philippines and serving as an elected \nofficial of a province, similar to a county commissioner in the United States. Applicant\u2019s \nin-laws all reside in a northern province of the Philippines. He states that his wife and her \nbrother are estranged, but he provided no details of the nature or reasons for their \nestrangement. \nIn Applicant\u2019s answer to the SOR, he stated that he and his father-in-law do not \nspeak, \u201cas it is our nature.\u201d He and his mother-in-law \u201ccordially greet each other\u201d when \nhis wife talks with her mother. He declared that he has no meaningful contact with his in-\nlaws, and he has no emotional ties to them. His wife speaks with her mother weekly, her \nfather monthly, and her estranged brother quarterly. \nThe Philippines is a multi-party, constitutional republic with a bicameral legislature. \nThe United States recognized the Philippines as an independent state and established \ndiplomatic relations in 1946. The United States has designated the Philippines as a major \nnon-NATO ally, and there are close and abiding security ties between the two nations, \nbased on strong historical and cultural links and a shared commitment to democracy and \nhuman rights. The Manila Declaration of 2011 reaffirmed the 1951 U.S. Philippines Mutual \nDefense Treaty as the foundation for a robust, balanced, and responsive security \npartnership. The U.S.-Philippine Bilateral Strategic Dialogue (BSD) is an annual forum for \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nforward planning across the spectrum of the relationship. The most recent BSD was in \nJanuary 2023, when senior Philippine and U.S. foreign affairs and defense officials \nconvened in Manila. There is no evidence that the Philippines engages in economic or \nmilitary intelligence activity directed toward the United States. \nThe United States is among the Philippines\u2019 top trading partners, and it traditionally \nhas been the Philippines\u2019 largest foreign investor. The United States and the Philippines \nhave a bilateral trade and investment framework and a tax treaty. Philippine imports from \nthe United States include raw and semi-processed materials for the manufacture of \nsemiconductors, electronics and electrical machinery, transport equipment, cereals, and \ncereal preparations. \nPhilippine national elections have been generally free and fair, but independent \nobservers have noted widespread vote buying, and dynastic political families have \nmonopolized elective offices at the national and local level. \nThe most significant human rights problems in the Philippines are extrajudicial \nkillings, enforced disappearances undertaken by security forces and vigilante groups, a \nweak and overburdened criminal justice system, widespread official corruption and abuse \nof power, and impunity from prosecution for human rights abuses. Other human rights \nproblems include prisoner and detainee torture and abuse by security forces, violence \nand harassment against human rights activists by security forces, warrantless arrests, \nlengthy pretrial detentions, poor prison conditions, killings and harassment of journalists, \nviolence against women, abuse and sexual exploitation of children, and trafficking in \npersons. \nMore than four million Filipino-Americans live in the United States, and almost \n300,000 U.S. citizens reside in the Philippines, including a large number of U.S. military \nveterans. Additionally, Manila is home to the only Veterans Administration regional office \noutside the United States, and the American Cemetery in Manila is the largest American \nmilitary cemetery outside the United States. \nMuslim separatists, communist insurgencies, and terrorist organizations are active \nin the Philippines; and they have killed Philippine security forces, local government \nofficials, and other civilians. Through joint U.S.-Philippine cooperation, the ability of these \nvarious groups to operate in the Philippines has been constrained but not eliminated. \nGangs of kidnappers have targeted foreigners, including Filipino-Americans. \nThe State Department has issued a Level 2 travel advisory (exercise increased \ncaution) for the Philippines. It has issued a Level 4 travel advisory (do not travel) for the \nSulu Archipelago and areas of Mindanao province, located in the southern Philippines, \ndue to the high threat of kidnapping and violent activities of terrorist and insurgent groups. \nIn Applicant\u2019s response to the FORM, he attached a map of the Philippines and pointed \nout that his wife\u2019s family members live in a northern province of the Philippines, and the \nLevel 4 travel advisory pertains only to the Sulu Archipelago and Mindanao areas, about \n640 miles away from where his wife\u2019s family members live and work.

He admitted this allegation in his \nanswer to the SOR. He described his experience with marijuana as \u201cfake happiness for \none hour,\u201d followed by a return to reality. He explained that he was in deep grief after the \nloss of both parents and was under stress from having tendered a resignation from his \nemployment due to a conflict with his boss. He asked his wife to purchase edible \nmarijuana for him, and she complied. He admitted using the marijuana more than once \nduring October 2021, \u201cout of a silly notion of not wasting resources.\u201d He returned to his \njob when his coworkers and a new boss invited him back before his resignation was \naccepted. In Applicant\u2019s response to the FORM, he submitted a statement promising to \nabstain from future illegal drug involvement and substance abuse, with the understanding \nthat failure to uphold his promise to abstain from drug involvement and substance abuse \nwill be grounds for revocation of his national security eligibility. (AX A at 2) \nPolicies \nThe standard set out in the adjudicative guidelines for assignment to sensitive \nduties is that the person\u2019s loyalty, reliability, and trustworthiness are such that assigning \nthe person to sensitive duties is clearly consistent with the interests of national security. \nSEAD 4, \u00b6 E.4. A person who seeks access to sensitive information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, \nby necessity, consideration of the possible risk the applicant may deliberately or \ninadvertently fail to safeguard sensitive information.  \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a public trust position, the \nadministrative judge must consider the disqualifying and mitigating conditions in the \nadjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, \nrecognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in \nconjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. Under AG \n\u00b6 2(b), any doubt will be resolved in favor of national security. The Government must \npresent substantial evidence to establish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \n\u00b6 E3.1.14. Once the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. \nAn applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, and the burden of \ndisproving it never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. \nBd. Sep. 22, 2005). An applicant has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly \nconsistent with national security to grant or continue eligibility for access to sensitive \ninformation. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAnalysis \nGuideline B, Foreign Influence \nThe trustworthiness concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 6: \nForeign contacts and interests, including, but not limited to, business, \nfinancial, and property interests, are a national security concern if they result \nin divided allegiance. They may also be a national security concern if they \ncreate circumstances in which the individual maybe manipulated or induced \nto help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a way \ninconsistent with U.S. interests or otherwise made vulnerable to pressure \nor coercion by any foreign interest. Assessment of foreign contacts and \ninterests should consider the country in which the foreign contact or interest \nis located, including, but not limited to, considerations such as whether it is \nknown to target U.S. citizens to obtain classified or sensitive information or \nis associated with a risk of terrorism. \nThe following disqualifying conditions are relevant: \nAG \u00b6 7(a): contact, regardless of method, with a foreign family member, \nbusiness or professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen \nof or resident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk \nof foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; \nAG \u00b6 7(b): connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country \nthat create a potential conflict of interest between the individual's obligation \nto protect classified or sensitive information or technology and the \nindividual's desire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing \nthat information or technology; and \nAG \u00b6 7(e): shared living quarters with a person or persons, regardless of \ncitizenship status, if that relationship creates a heightened risk of foreign \ninducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion. \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 7(a) and (e) require substantial evidence of a \u201cheightened risk.\u201d The \n\u201cheightened risk\u201d required to raise one of these disqualifying conditions is a relatively low \nstandard. \u201cHeightened risk\u201d denotes a risk greater than the normal risk inherent in having \na family member living under a foreign government. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 12-05839 \nat 4 (App. Bd. Jul. 11, 2013). It is not a high standard. See, e.g., ISCR Case No.17-03026 \nat 5 (App. Bd. Jan. 16, 2019). It is a level of risk one step above a State Department Level \n1 travel advisory (\u201cexercise normal precaution\u201d) and equivalent to the Level 2 advisory \n(\u201cexercise increased caution\u201d). \nWhen family ties are involved, the totality of an applicant\u2019s family ties to a foreign \ncountry as well as each individual family tie must be considered. ISCR Case No. 01-\n22693 at 7 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2003). There is a rebuttable presumption that a person has \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nties of affection for, or obligation to, the immediate family members of the person's \nspouse. ISCR Case No. 01-03120 (App. Bd. Feb. 20, 2002); see also ISCR Case No. 09-\n06457 at 4 (App. Bd. May 16, 2011). Applicant\u2019s declared lack of meaningful contact with \nhis in-laws is sufficient to rebut this presumption.  \nGuideline B is not limited to countries hostile to the United States. \u201cThe United \nStates has a compelling interest in protecting and safeguarding classified or sensitive \ninformation from any person, organization, or country that is not authorized to have \naccess to it, regardless of whether that person, organization, or country has interests \ninimical to those of the United States.\u201d ISCR Case No. 02-11570 at 5 (App. Bd. May 19, \n2004). \nFurthermore, \u201ceven friendly nations can have profound disagreements with the \nUnited States over matters they view as important to their vital interests or national \nsecurity.\u201d ISCR Case No. 00-0317 (App. Bd. Mar. 29, 2002). Finally, we know friendly \nnations have engaged in espionage against the United States, especially in the economic, \nscientific, and technical fields. Nevertheless, the nature of a nation\u2019s government, its \nrelationship with the United States, and its human-rights record are relevant in assessing \nthe likelihood that an applicant\u2019s family members are vulnerable to government coercion. \nThe risk of coercion, persuasion, or duress is significantly greater if the foreign country \nhas an authoritarian government, a family member is associated with or dependent upon \nthe government, or the country is known to conduct intelligence operations against the \nUnited States. In considering the nature of the government, an administrative judge must \nalso consider any terrorist activity in the country at issue. See generally ISCR Case No. \n02-26130 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 7, 2006). \nAn applicant\u2019s ties, either directly or through a family member, to persons of high \nrank in a foreign government or military are of particular concern, insofar as it is \nforeseeable that through an association with such persons the applicant could come to \nthe attention of those interested in acquiring U.S. protected information. See, e.g., ISCR \nCase No. 08-10025 at 2 and 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 3, 2009) (Applicant\u2019s brother was a high-\nlevel foreign government official); ISCR Case No.11-04980 at 2 and 6 (App. Bd. Sep. \n21,2012) (Applicant\u2019s sister-in-law was married to a retired high-ranking official in a \nforeign army); and ISCR Case No. 11-12632 at 2 and 5 (App. Bd. Feb. 2, 2015) \n(Applicant\u2019s niece was an employee of a high-ranking foreign government official). In this \ncase, Applicant\u2019s brother-in-law occupies a local government position, but not one in \nwhich foreign policy or national security matters are involved. \nBased on all the above considerations, I conclude that the low threshold of \nevidence required to raise \u201cheightened risk\u201d under AG \u00b6\u00b6 7(a) and 7(e), and the potential \nconflict of interest under AG \u00b6 7(b) is established. \nThe following mitigating conditions are potentially applicable: \nAG \u00b6 8(a): the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country \nin which these persons are located, or the positions or activities of those \npersons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be placed \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nin a position of having to choose between the interests of a foreign \nindividual, group, organization, or government and the interests of the \nUnited States; \nAG \u00b6 8(b): there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s \nsense of loyalty or obligation to the foreign person, or allegiance to the \ngroup, government, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such deep \nand longstanding relationships and loyalties in the United States, that the \nindividual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the \nU.S. interest; and \nAG \u00b6 8(c): contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and \ninfrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign \ninfluence or exploitation. \nBased on all the evidence, I conclude that all three mitigating conditions are \nestablished, based on Applicant\u2019s lack of a meaningful connection with his in-laws, the \ngeographical separation of his in-laws from the areas where insurgents and terrorists are \nactive, the lack of evidence that the Philippines targets the United States for economic or \nmilitary information, and Applicant\u2019s deep and longstanding relationships and loyalties in \nthe United States. \nGuideline H, Drug Involvement and Substance Abuse \nThe trustworthiness under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 24: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual's reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior may \nlead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. Controlled substance means any \"controlled substance\" as \ndefined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term adopted in \nthis guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above. \nThe following disqualifying conditions under this guideline are relevant: \nAG \u00b6 25(a): any substance misuse (see above definition); \nAG \u00b6 25(c): illegal possession of a controlled substance, including cultivation, \nprocessing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of drug \nparaphernalia; and \nAG \u00b6 25(f): any illegal drug use while granted access to classified information or \nholding a sensitive position. \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 25(a) and 25(c) are established by Applicant\u2019s admissions. However, AG \u00b6 \n25(f) is not established, because the evidence does not establish that Applicant had \nactual access to classified information when he used marijuana. His response to the SOR \nindicates that he used marijuana while he was on leave and waiting for his tendered \nresignation to be accepted. There is no evidence that he used marijuana after he returned \nto work. See ISCR Case No. 20-03111 at 3 (App. Bd. Aug. 10, 2022). \nThe following mitigating conditions are relevant: \nAG \u00b6 26(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \nhappened under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not \ncast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \nAG \u00b6 26(b): the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this \nproblem, and has established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not \nlimited to: \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; \nand \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that any future \ninvolvement or misuse is grounds for revocation of national security \neligibility. \nAG \u00b6 26(a) is established. Applicant\u2019s marijuana use occurred more than two years \nago, but it was frequent, albeit for a short duration, during the month of October 2021. It \nhappened under a confluence of stressful situations which are not likely to recur, i.e, the \ndeath of both parents and his belief that he had lost a job that he had held since 2006. \nAG \u00b6 26(b) is partially established. Applicant has not changed his associates or \nhis environment. Applicant\u2019s wife was complicit in his marijuana use, and they continue \nto live together. However, he has submitted a statement of intent in accordance with .AG \n\u00b6 26(b)(3). \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \npublic trust position must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-\nperson concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a public \ntrust position by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ncircumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process \nfactors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nI have incorporated my comments under Guidelines H and B in my whole-person \nanalysis. I have noted that Applicant has worked for the same defense contractor since \nJanuary 2006 and has held a security clearance since December 2013, apparently \nwithout incident until his marijuana use in October 2021. Because he requested a \ndetermination on the record without a hearing, I had no opportunity to question him or \nevaluate his credibility and sincerity based on demeanor. See ISCR Case No. 01-12350 \nat 3-4 (App. Bd. Jul. 23, 2003). \nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under Guidelines H and \nB and evaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant \nhas mitigated the trustworthiness concerns based on his foreign family connections and \nshort-lived use of marijuana. Accordingly, I conclude he has carried his burden of showing \nthat it is clearly consistent with national security to grant him eligibility for a public trust \nposition. \nFormal Findings \nParagraph 1, Guideline B (Foreign Influence): \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.c: \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline H (Drug Involvement): \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 2.a: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nI conclude that it is clearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant \nApplicant eligibility for a public trust position.

In his background investigation, he reiterated that he plans to pay these \ndebts but has made no arrangements or agreements to do so. (Item 5.) \nUnder Guideline E, the SOR alleged that Applicant deliberately failed to disclose \nthat his federal student loans and consumer loans were in collection or delinquent. (SOR.) \nApplicant did not respond to this allegation. It is, therefore, deemed a denial. He disclosed \nhis delinquent income tax debt in his SCA. \nSection 26 of Applicant\u2019s SCA asked in pertinent part: \u201cIn the past seven (7) years, \nyou had bills or debts turned over to a collection agency? [and] In the past seven [7], you \nhad any account or credit card suspended, charged off, or cancelled for failing to pay as \nagreed? (Item 3.) He answered \u201cNo\u201d to both questions and did not disclose the status of \nhis student loans or his consumer loans. (Item 3.) He did, however, discuss those loans \nin his background investigation, where he stated: [He was] not aware [he] needed to list \nnon-delinquent student loan payments. As to his consumer loans, he stated that: [He was \nnot] aware [he] needed to list debts more than seven years old. (Item 5.)  \nLaw and Policies \nIt is well-established law that no one has a right to a security clearance. As noted \nby the Supreme Court in Department of the Navy v. Egan, \u201cthe clearly consistent standard\nindicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of\ndenials.\u201d Department of Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988) (\u201cit should be obvious\nthat no one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance\u201d); Duane v. Department of Defense, 275\nF.3d 988, 994 (10th  Cir. 2002) (no right to a security clearance).  \n \n \n \n \nUnder Egan, Executive Order 10865, and the Directive, any doubt about whether \nan applicant should be allowed access to classified information will be resolved in favor \nof protecting national security. A favorable clearance decision establishes eligibility of an \napplicant to be granted a security clearance for access to confidential, secret, or top-\nsecret information. An unfavorable clearance decision (1) denies any application, (2) \nrevokes any existing security clearance, and (3) prevents access to classified information \nat any level Directive, \u00b6 3.2. \nThere is no presumption in favor of granting, renewing, or continuing eligibility for \naccess to classified information. ISCR Case No. 02-18663 (App. Bd. Mar. 23, 2004). The \nGovernment has the burden of presenting evidence to establish facts alleged in the SOR \nthat have been controverted. An applicant is responsible for presenting evidence to refute, \nexplain, extenuate, or mitigate facts that have been admitted or proven. In addition, an \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision. \nDirective, \u00b6 E3.1.14; Directive, Enclosure 3, \u00b6 E3.1.15. \nIn Egan, the Supreme Court stated that the burden of proof is less than a \npreponderance of evidence.

Dec. 19, 2002) (citations omitted). \nDiscussion \nGuideline F - Financial Considerations \nUnder Guideline F for financial considerations, the suitability of an applicant may \nbe questioned or put into doubt when that applicant has a history of excessive \nindebtedness or financial problems or difficulties. \nThe overall concern is: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. AG \u00b6 18. \nThe concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified information to obtain money or something else of value. It \nencompasses concerns about a person\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other important \nqualities. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information. \nIn analyzing the facts of this case, I considered the following disqualifying \nconditions or factors: \nAG \u00b6 19(a) inability to satisfy debts; \nAG \u00b6 19(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \nAG \u00b6 19(f) failure . . . to pay annual Federal . . . income tax as required. \nI also considered the following mitigating- conditions or factors: \nAG \u00b6 20(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not \ncast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment;  \nAG \u00b6 20(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; and \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n Applicant\u2019s admissions and the Government\u2019s credit report supports a conclusion \nthat Applicant has had a problematic financial history. Facts admitted by an applicant in \nan answer to a SOR require no further proof by the Government. ISCR Case No. 94-1159 \nat 4 (App. Bd. Dec. 4, 1995) (\u201cany admissions [applicant] made to the SOR allegations . \n. . relieve Department Counsel of its burden of proof\u201d); ISCR Case No. 94-0569 at 4 and \nn.1 (App. Bd. Mar. 30, 1995) (\u201c[a]n applicant\u2019s admissions, whether testimonial or written, \ncan provide a legal basis for an Administrative Judge\u2019s findings\u201d). The record raises \nsecurity concerns under disqualifying factors AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a), 19(c), and 19(f).  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax \nauthority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \nThe next inquiry is whether any potentially mitigating conditions apply. Applicant\u2019s \ndelinquent consumer debts are numerous and persist to this day. They are recurring. AG \n\u00b6 20(a) does not apply. \nI also considered AG \u00b6 20(b) as a mitigating condition. Applicant alluded generally \nto his lack of a permanent position, layoffs, or insufficient income as causes of his financial \nproblems. Although he provided no concrete details, those factors could be \u201clargely \nbeyond\u201d his control as contemplated by AG \u00b6 20(b). Thus, the first requirement of AG \u00b6 \n20(b) is satisfied. \nThat does not, however, end the inquiry. Applicant must have \u201cacted responsibly\u201d \nunder the adverse conditions he confronted. Here, Applicant\u2019s conduct amounted to \nnothing more than stating his intent to pay in the future. He showed no solid efforts to \naddress debts under his adverse circumstances. What is required is that an applicant \nhave a reasonable plan to pay off his debts and has taken some steps towards execution \nof that plan. Mere promises to pay are insufficient. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 09-08462 \nat 3 (App. Bd. May 3, 2011). AG \u00b6 20(b) does not apply. \nI have considered mitigating condition AG \u00b6 20(g). Applicant admittedly has made \nno plan or arrangement with the federal tax authority to address his delinquent income \ntaxes. Therefore, AG \u00b6 20(g) does not apply. \nApplicant\u2019s federal student loans were in an automatic state of administrative \nforbearance from March 13, 2020 to September 1, 2023. His loans were deferred and not \ndeemed to be in default during that time. I find in favor of Applicant as to his federal \nstudent loans, notwithstanding that they were reported in collections in November 2022. \nGuideline E - Personal Conduct  \nIn assessing an allegation of deliberate falsification, I consider applicant\u2019s answer \nand all relevant circumstances. AG \u00b6\u00b6 2(d)(1)-(9) and 2(f)(1)-(6) (explaining the whole \nperson concept). Under Guideline E for personal conduct, the concern is that \u201c[c]onduct \n5 \n\n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ninvolving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply \nwith rules and regulations can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and ability classified or sensitive information.\u201d A statement is false or \ndishonest when it is made deliberately (knowingly and willfully). An omission of relevant \nand material information is not deliberate if, for example, the person genuinely forgot \nabout it, inadvertently overlooked it, misunderstood the question, reasonably did not know \nthe information, or genuinely thought the information did not need to be reported. \nThe evidence shows that Applicant did not disclose his federal student loans on \nhis SCA. In his background investigations, he explained that he was \u201cnot aware [he] \nneeded to list non-delinquent student loan payments.\u201d Given the evolving history of the \ncurrent student loan program, that was a reasonable and honest answer. I do not find that \nhe deliberately omitted listing his student loans in his SCA. \nThe SOR also alleged that Applicant deliberately omitted his delinquent consumer \nloans from his SCA. He did not disclose those debts in his SCA. Parsed in more detail, \nthe SCA asked: (1) Were any bills or debts turned over to a collection agency; and (2) \nWas any account or credit card suspended, charged off, or cancelled for failing to pay as \nagreed? His Answer failed to respond to this allegation, so it was deemed a denial. In his \nbackground investigation, he denied by saying: \u201c[He was not] aware [he] needed to list \ndebts more than seven years old.\u201d \nApplicant\u2019s state of mind (deliberately) was, therefore, controverted. That the only \ncredit report noted that the consumer loans were in collections is not evidence that he \nknew those accounts were in that status and were so reported or knew they had not been \npaid when he completed his SCA. Nor is his failure to disclose them in his SCA evidence \nof a deliberate state of mind in omitting them. In short, the Government has not carried \nits burden. Guideine E security concerns are not established. I do not find that he \ndeliberately omitted listing his consumer loans in his SCA. \n Whole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances.  \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the potentially \ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and circumstances \nsurrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under Guideline F and Guideline \nE in my whole-person analysis. \nApplicant leaves me with questions about his eligibility and suitability for a security \nclearance. For those reasons, I conclude that Applicant has not mitigated the security \nconcerns arising under Guideline F, financial considerations. Security concerns arising \nunder Guideline E, personal conduct, are not established. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n       \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n          \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n         \n \n           \n \n         \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nFormal Findings \nAs required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, I make the following \nformal findings on the SOR allegations: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.b-1.e,1.g-1q,1.s:  \n(Student Loans) \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.a, 1.f, 1.r, 1.t-1.aa: \n(Consumer Loans) \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.bb.: \n(Taxes) \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline E  \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 2.a.  \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of the record as a whole, it is not clearly consistent with the national \ninterest to grant Applicant access to classified information. \nPhilip J.

(Items 2-4) \nApplicant stated that he began using marijuana while in college in approximately \n2010. He lived in a state where marijuana is legal under state law. He had a medical \nmarijuana license from the state to treat insomnia. He also used marijuana because he \nenjoyed it. He estimated that he used marijuana approximately 1000 times. He used \nmarijuana by smoking it, vaping it, and ingesting THC-laced gummies. His most \nfrequent use was during his college years. Since 2015 to 2016, he claims to have \nsignificantly decreased his use of marijuana. He claims his last use was in April 2022 \nand he no longer associates with people who use or sell marijuana.

(Items \n2-4) \nUse of Alprazolam without a prescription. Applicant admitted using \nAlprazolam without a legal prescription on under 20 occasions between September \n2014 and December 2021. He claims he primarily used it due to his insomnia and stress \nduring his final year of college in 2015. He claims he no longer uses this drug because \nhe has found other ways to deal with his stress and insomnia. He claims he no longer \nassociates with individuals involved with this drug. He listed his use on his SCA. (Items \n2-4) \nCocaine use. Applicant admitted using cocaine approximately 12-17 occasions \nbetween September 2014 and March 2021. He claims he primarily used it during his \ncollege years. He claims he no longer uses this drug and will not use it in the future. He \nclaims he no longer associates with individuals involved with this drug. He listed his use \non his SCA. (Items 2-4) \nCocaine purchase. Applicant admitted purchasing cocaine approximately 10 \ntimes between 2014 and March 2021. He claims his last cocaine purchase was in \nMarch 2021, for his bachelor party. He claims he no longer uses this drug. He claims he \nno longer associates with individuals involved with this drug. He listed his use on his \nSCA. (Items 2-4) \nEcstasy use. Applicant admitted using ecstasy approximately 12-15 times \nbetween June 2010 and April 2016. He claims he primarily used it while attending music \nfestivals.

Applicant admitted using Xanax between \nAugust 2015 and September 2015, without a legal prescription. He pointed out that \nXanax is the brand name for the drug Alprazolam.

Applicant admitted using \nHydrocodone between August 2015 and September 2015, without a legal prescription. \nHe gained access to this drug by stealing it from the pharmacy where he worked. He \nclaims he has no intention of using this drug in the future. He listed his use on his SCA. \n(Items 2-4) \nGuideline E. \nApplicant admitted the Guideline E allegations. He admitted that he stole the \nprescription drugs of Xanax, Oxycodone, and Hydrocodone, while employed at a \npharmacy in approximately September 2015. He obtained the drugs for his personal \nuse without an authorized prescription. After his actions came to light, he left his \nemployment by mutual agreement because of his theft of the drugs. He listed these \ncircumstances on his SCA. (Items 2-4) \nIn about September 2015, Applicant was charged by local authorities with petty \ntheft of the drugs described above. His case was disposed of through a deferred entry \nof judgment. He complied with all the conditions imposed by the court and the charges \nwere then dismissed. The underlying conduct for both SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.a and 2.b is the same \nand the pleadings are therefore duplicitous. I find in favor of Applicant regarding SOR \u00b6 \n2.b. (Items 2-4) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process.

According to AG \u00b6 \n2(a), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk that an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline H, Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nAG \u00b6 24 expresses the security concern pertaining to drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual's reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior \nmay lead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nquestions about a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. Controlled substance means any \"controlled substance\" \nas defined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term \nadopted in this guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above. \nAG \u00b6 25 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. Three conditions are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) any substance misuse; and \n(c) illegal possession of a controlled substance, including cultivation, \nprocessing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of \ndrug paraphernalia. \nApplicant used and purchased marijuana, cocaine, and ecstasy on multiple \noccasions from 2010 to 2022. He also used the prescription drugs Hydrocodone and \nOxycodone without a legal prescription during 2015; and used Xanax without a \nprescription from 2014 to 2021. I find that AG \u00b6\u00b6 25(a) and 25(c) apply. \nAG \u00b6 26 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. Two \npotentially apply in this case: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \nand \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this \nproblem, and has established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not \nlimited to: \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were \nused; and \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all \ndrug involvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that \nany future involvement or misuse is grounds for revocation \nof national security eligibility. \nApplicant\u2019s most recent use and purchase of marijuana was in April 2022, four \nmonths after beginning his employment with a defense contractor. His most recent use \nand purchase of cocaine was in March 2021, and his most recent use and purchase of \necstasy was in 2016. He estimated he used marijuana approximately 1,000 times \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \nthrough the years. He claims his Xanax misuse was primarily during his last year of \ncollege (2015), but he admitted using it as recently as 2021. While he expressed his \nintent not to use illegal drugs or abuse prescription drugs in the future, he did not \nprovide a signed statement of his intent not to use or misuse drugs in the future. He also \nclaimed to disassociate with persons involved with drugs. Since Applicant chose to have \nhis case decided without a hearing, I am unable to make a credibility finding. Applicant\u2019s \nshort abstention involving marijuana, cocaine and Xanax is insufficient to convince me \nthat recurrence is unlikely. AG \u00b6 26(a) does not apply, while AG \u00b6 26(b)(3) has some \napplication. \nApplicant\u2019s use of ecstasy, Hydrocodone, and Oxycodone was much more \nremote and infrequent and is mitigated under AG \u00b6 26(a). \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the personal conduct security concern: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. They include: \n(c) credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is \nnot sufficient for an adverse determination under any other single \nguideline, but which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-\nperson \nassessment \nof \nquestionable \njudgment, \nuntrustworthiness, \nunreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and \nregulations, or other characteristics indicating that the individual may not \nproperly safeguard classified or sensitive information; \nApplicant\u2019s theft of prescription drugs while employed by a pharmacy in 2015 \nreflects questionable judgment and an unwillingness to comply with rules and \nregulations. The conduct alleged under SOR \u00b6 2.a might also be covered under \nGuideline J (Criminal Conduct) at AG \u00b6 30; however, it would likely be mitigated by the \npassage of time. Nonetheless, the alleged conduct is sufficient raises the general \nconcerns about questionable judgment and an unwillingness to comply with rules and \nregulations addressed in AG \u00b6\u00b6 15 and 16(c). \nI have also considered all of the mitigating conditions for personal conduct under \nAG \u00b6 17, and find the following relevant: \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; and  \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, \nunreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely \nto recur. \nAbusing his employer\u2019s trust by stealing drugs for his own personal use certainly \ncalls into question whether he is can be trusted to safeguard classified information. \nHowever, this one-time incident occurred in 2015, and Applicant no longer works at a \npharmacy with availability to prescription drugs. He acknowledged that what he did was \nwrong and listed this misconduct on his SCA. AG \u00b6\u00b6 17(c) and 17(d) substantially apply. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guideline and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I considered that he used marijuana \nas recently as April 2022 and other drugs as recently as 2021. I also considered the \ncircumstances he described surrounding his drug use and his stated intent not to use \ndrugs in the future. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant failed to mitigate the security concerns arising under Guideline H, \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \ndrug involvement and substance misuse.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant admitted to all the allegations in SOR. After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, I make the following findings of fact. Applicant is a 30-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has been employed with the defense contractor since September 2016. He was granted a security clearance soon thereafter. He is unmarried and has no children. (TR at page 14 line 11 to page 18 line 6, and GX 1 at pages 5, 10 and 28.) Guideline H - Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse 1.a.

On October 12, 2023, Applicant offered Applicant Exhibits (AppXs) \nA~L, which were received and admitted without objection. The record closed at that \ntime. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant admitted to all the allegations in SOR. After a thorough and careful \nreview of the pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, I make the following findings of fact. \nApplicant is a 30-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has been \nemployed with the defense contractor since September 2016. He was granted a \nsecurity clearance soon thereafter. He is unmarried and has no children. (TR at page 14 \nline 11 to page 18 line 6, and GX 1 at pages 5, 10 and 28.) \nGuideline H - Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \n1.a. Applicant admits that he smoked marijuana once in September of 2021. He \nwas at a Rave party. There, one of his friends overdosed on drugs and died. Applicant \nsmoked marijuana to help him cope with the death and sleep that night. (TR at page 18 \nlines 7~13, and at page 19 line 15 to page 23 line 9.) He held a security clearance at \nthat time. He also used marijuana and ecstasy in the distant past. (GX 3 at page 5.) \nGuideline E - Personal Conduct \n2.a. Applicant answered, \u201cNo,\u201d to Section 23 on his February 2017 SF-86, as to \n\u201cIllegal Use of Drugs or Drug Activity . . . In the last seven (7) years,\u201d as he \u201chonestly \nwasn\u2019t sure if it (past use of marijuana and ecstasy) was before the seven years or not.\u201d \n(TR at page 18 line 13 to page 19 line 14, and GX 2 at pages 25~26.) \n2.b. Applicant answered, \u201cNo,\u201d to Section 23 on his February 2022 SF-86, as to \n\u201cIllegal Use of Drugs or Drug Activity . . . In the last seven (7) years.\u201d This was a willful \nfalsification since he had used it in September 2021. (TR at page 23 line 10 to page 24 \nline 5, and GX 1 at page 26.) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for national security eligibility, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines (AG) list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. The entire \nprocess is a conscientious scrutiny of applicable guidelines in the context of a number \nof variables known as the whole-person concept. The administrative judge must \nconsider all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable \nand unfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. I have not drawn inferences based on mere \nspeculation or conjecture. \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.14, requires the Government to present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d \n \n \n \n \n \n \nA person applying for national security eligibility seeks to enter into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants national security eligibility. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified or \nsensitive information. Finally, as emphasized in Section 7 of Executive Order 10865, \n\u201c[a]ny determination under this order adverse to an applicant shall be a determination in \nterms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty \nof the applicant concerned.\u201d See also Executive Order 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing \nmultiple prerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information.) \nAnalysis \nGuideline H - Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Drug Involvement and \nSubstance Misuse is set forth at AG \u00b6 24: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual's reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior \nmay lead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nand regulations. Controlled substance means any \"controlled substance\" \nas defined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term \nadopted in this guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above. \nThe guideline at AG \u00b6 25 contains seven conditions that could raise a security \nconcern and may be disqualifying. Three conditions are established: \n(a) any substance misuse (see above definition); \n(c) illegal possession of a controlled substance, including cultivation, \nprocessing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of \ndrug paraphernalia; and \n(f) any illegal drug use while granted access to classified information or \nholding a sensitive position. \nAppellant used marijuana and ecstasy in the distant past, and smoked marijuana \nin September of 2021. He had a security clearance for his job at the time of his last \nusage. Therefore, AG \u00b6 25 (a), (c), and (f) are established. \nThe guideline at AG \u00b6 26 contains four conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns. Two conditions may be applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \nand \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this \nproblem, and has established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not \nlimited to: \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts;  \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were \nused; and  \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all \ndrug involvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that \nany future involvement or misuse is grounds for revocation \nof national security eligibility. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nExcept for his marijuana usage in February of 2022, Applicant drug involvement \nwas in the distant past. However, there is no evidence that he has cut his social \ncontacts, nor has he provided a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse in the future. Drug Involvement and Substance \nMisuse is found against Applicant. \nGuideline E - Personal Conduct \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Personal Conduct is set out in \nAG \u00b6 15: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. The following will normally result \nin an unfavorable national security eligibility determination, security \nclearance action, or cancellation of further processing for national security \neligibility: \n(a) refusal, or failure without reasonable cause, to undergo \nor cooperate with security processing, including but not \nlimited to meeting with a security investigator for subject \ninterview, completing security forms or releases, cooperation \nwith medical or psychological evaluation, or polygraph \nexamination, if authorized and required; and \n(b) refusal to provide full, frank, and truthful answers to \nlawful questions of investigators, security officials, or other \nofficial representatives in connection with a personnel \nsecurity or trustworthiness determination. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 16. One is potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or \nsimilar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment \nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine national security \neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities. \nApplicant falsified his February 2017 SF-86 (when in doubt he should have erred \non the side of caution and disclosed his past usage of marijuana and ecstasy). He also \nclearly falsified his June 2022 SF-86. \nThe evidence is sufficient to raise these \ndisqualifying conditions. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 17 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. I considered \nall of the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 17 including: \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts. \nThis does not apply, Applicant continued his denial of past drug usage on his \nsecond SF-86, only a year prior to the issuance of his SOR and less than ten months \nafter his September 2021 use of marijuana. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s national security eligibility by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \nAccording to AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant national \nsecurity eligibility must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the applicable guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuidelines H and E in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were \naddressed under those guidelines, but some warrant additional comment. Applicant is \nwell respected in the workplace. He performs well at his job. (AppXs A~L.) \nHowever, overall, the record evidence leaves me with questions or doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant failed to mitigate the Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse, and \nPersonal Conduct security concerns. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline H: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 1.a: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline E: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 2.a, and 2.b: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance. In the future, with an extended period of abstinence from drugs, and with \ntruthful responses on his SF-86, Applicant may again seek a security clearance. \nHowever, at present his national security eligibility for access to classified information is \ndenied. \nRichard A.

He also \nadmitted that from July 2015 to May 2017, he used marijuana with varying frequency. \n(Applicant\u2019s Answer to SOR) \nIn his answer to the SOR, Applicant stated that when he used hallucinogenic \nmushrooms in March 2020, it was a one-time impulsive occurrence where the \nsubstance was offered to him by his friends. He stated that he \u201clet his guard down\u201d \nthrough a combination of rationalizations, namely a desire to share an experience with \nhis friends, and a genuine curiosity. He further stated that after he experienced it and \nreflected on his actions, he realized that he had been short-sighted and immature. He \nstated that he has no intentions to ever use it again. (Government Exhibit 3.) \nAt the time he used the hallucinogenic mushrooms in March 2020, Applicant was \nemployed with a defense contractor and possessed a security clearance and held a \nsensitive position.

(Government Exhibit 3.) \nApplicant also stated that while in college he used marijuana from July 2015 to \nMay 2017. In 2015, the first time he used it, he was 19-years-old. From then to about \n2017, he used marijuana occasionally. On these occasions, he received marijuana \nfrom his friend or roommate, and normally during academic breaks. He stated that he \nnever had the urge to use it more frequently. In August 2018, Applicant first applied for \na security clearance. He was granted a Secret security clearance in November 2018. \nHe stated that by the time he applied for his internship in June 2018, with a defense \ncontractor, he had not used marijuana for about a year, so he comfortably tested \nmarijuana free. He stated that he has not used marijuana since 2017, and has no \ninterest in ever using it again. (Government Exhibit 3.) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious \nscrutiny of a number of variables known as the whole-person concept. The \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.14, requires the Government to present evidence that \nestablishes controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the \n\u201capplicant is responsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, \nextenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, \nand has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance \ndecision.\u201d \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nA person who applies for access to classified information seeks to enter into a \nfiduciary relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline H - Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Drug Involvement and \nSubstance Misuse is set forth at AG \u00b6 24: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual's reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior \nmay lead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. Controlled substance means any \"controlled substance\" \nas defined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term \nadopted in this guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above. \nThe guideline at AG \u00b6 25 contains three conditions that could raise a security \nconcern and may be disqualifying: \n(a) any substance misuse (see above definition);   \n(c) illegal possession of a controlled substance, including cultivation, \nprocessing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of \ndrug paraphernalia; and  \n(f) any illegal drug use while granted access to classified information or \nholding a sensitive position. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n          \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant knowingly used hallucinogenic mushrooms, an illegal substance, \nin March 2020, while granted access to classified information or while holding a \nsensitive position. The evidence is sufficient to raise the above disqualifying \nconditions. \nThe guideline at AG \u00b6 26 contains conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns. \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \nand \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this \nproblem, and has established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not \nlimited to: \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were \nused; and  \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all \ndrug involvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that \nany future involvement or misuse is grounds for revocation \nof national security eligibility. \nNone of the mitigating factors are applicable. Following a two-year history of \noccasional marijuana use which occurred from July 2015 to May 2017, when he was in \ncollege, Applicant continued to want to experiment with illegal drugs with his friends \nregardless of the consequences. \nIn March 2020, Applicant used hallucinogenic \nmushrooms, (which he describes as impulsive behavior), while employed with a \ndefense contractor, while granted a security clearance, and while holding a sensitive \nposition. He completely disregarded DoD policy, company policy, and Federal law. \nApplicant clearly has some more growing up to do. Applicant knew at the time he used \nthe mushrooms that the use of any illegal drug is strictly prohibited by the DoD, but he \nrationalized to himself that it would not be a serious violation. His behavior does not \nshow a high level of maturity, trustworthiness or good judgment. In this case, Applicant \nhas fallen short of meeting the eligibility requirements for access to classified \ninformation. \nConsidered in totality, Applicant\u2019s conduct precludes a finding of good judgment, \nreliability, and/or the ability to abide by rules and regulations. To be entrusted with the \nprivilege of holding a security clearance, applicants are expected to abide by all laws, \nregulations and policies that apply to them. Applicant has chosen to live his life to his \nconvenience and has disregarded the law.

Applicant has not demonstrated the level of maturity, \nintegrity, good judgment, and reliability necessary to access classified information. At \nthis time, Applicant does not meet the qualifications for access to classified information. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline H in my whole-person analysis. An individual who holds a security clearance \nis expected to comply with the law at all times. Applicant has not demonstrated the level \nof maturity needed for access to classified information. This is not an individual in \nwhom the Government can be confident to know that he will always follow rules and \nregulations and do the right thing, even when no one is looking. Applicant is not \nqualified for access to classified information. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with many questions and doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant failed to mitigate the Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nsecurity concerns. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline H: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 1.a through 1.b. \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.c. \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant national security eligibility \nfor a security clearance.

The SOR alleges the Chapter \n7 bankruptcy case (SOR \u00b6 1.h) and seven delinquent debts totaling about $57,877 (SOR \n\u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.g). Applicant admitted owing all of the debts at one time, but he stated that two \nof the debts were resolved through payment plans. (Items 3-5; AE A) \n \nApplicant reported financial issues on a Questionnaire for National Security \nPositions (SF 86) that he submitted in June 2022. He wrote that he had about $10,000 in \nunsecured debt. He indicated that it was \"[n]ot fully resolved yet across the board, but I \nhave reached out to the creditors/companies to satisfy the debts. Most of them will be \nsatisfied/paid within the next 30-60 days.\" He discussed six of the seven SOR debts during \nhis background interview in August 2022. It appears that one of the SOR debts (SOR \u00b6 \n1.e) was not delinquent at the time of the interview.

According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\"whole-person concept.\" The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \"[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\" \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \"witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\" The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation of potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \"in terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\" See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under AG \n\u00b6 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant has a history of financial problems, including a Chapter 7 bankruptcy \ncase and delinquent debts. The above disqualifying conditions are applicable. \nConditions that could mitigate the financial considerations security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 20. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; and \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nApplicant's wife has a debilitating autoimmune disease and other medical issues \nthat require expensive medication and treatments, and periodically prevent her from \nworking. Those conditions are beyond his control. To receive the benefit of AG \u00b6 20(b), \nApplicant must also prove that he acted responsibly under the circumstances. \nApplicant admitted he was young and spent lavishly on expensive items before the \nChapter 7 bankruptcy. That is borne out by the 2012 bankruptcy petition that reported he \nowed $31,336 for the deficiency balances on the loans for repossessed 2011 and 2012 \nvehicles. \nThe bankruptcy discharge gave Applicant a fresh start and should have steered \nhim in a different direction, but deficiency balances on the loans for two repossessed \nvehicles make up more than $30,400 of the SOR debts, and the vehicle for the $20,033 \ndebt was apparently repossessed after his background interview. Applicant is credited \nwith resolving three of the SOR debts with payments totaling about $3,000, and those \ndebts are mitigated. However, he still owes four debts with balances totaling about \n$46,900. He stated that he intends to pay those debts. However, intentions to resolve \nfinancial problems in the future are not a substitute for a track record of debt repayment \nor other responsible approaches. See ISCR Case No. 11-14570 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct. 23, \n2013). \nThere is insufficient evidence for a determination that Applicant's financial \nproblems will be resolved within a reasonable period. I am unable to find that he acted \nresponsibly under the circumstances or that he made a good-faith effort to pay his \nremaining debts. His financial issues are recent and ongoing. They continue to cast doubt \non his current reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. None of the financial \nconsiderations mitigating conditions are applicable to his remaining debts. \nWhole-Person Concept  \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant's eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant's \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n____________________ \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the potentially \ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and circumstances \nsurrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-\nperson analysis. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about \nApplicant's eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude Applicant did not \nmitigate the financial considerations security concerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAgainst Applicant  \nSubparagraph 1.a: \nSubparagraphs 1.b-1.d: \nSubparagraphs 1.e-1.h: \nAgainst Applicant \nFor Applicant \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIt is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for \na security clearance.

(SOR \u00b6 1.g) (Items 2, 3) \nIn his Supplemental SOR response, Applicant stated that he understood that \nmarijuana is \u201cfederally illegal, regardless of state laws.\u201d He said he understood that \n\u201cdrug use is incompatible with holding a security clearance.\u201d He said, \u201cI do not intend to \nuse illegal drugs in the future.\u201d (Item 1) Applicant did not respond to the Government\u2019s \nFORM or otherwise offer any mitigating evidence beyond what he had previously \nstated. \nPolicies \nIt is well established that no one has a right to a security clearance. As the \nSupreme Court held in Department of the Navy v. Egan, \u201cthe clearly consistent standard \nindicates that security determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d \n484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988). \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(a), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration.

Likewise, I have not drawn inferences grounded on \nmere speculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nAnalysis \nGuideline H, Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nAG \u00b6 24 expresses the security concern regarding drug involvement: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription drugs, and the use of other substances that can cause \nphysical or mental impairment or are used in a manner inconsistent with \ntheir intended use can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability and \ntrustworthiness, both because such behavior may lead to physical or \npsychological impairment and because it raises questions about a \nperson\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations. \nControlled substance means any \u201ccontrolled substance\u201d as defined in 21 \nU.S.C 802. Substance misuse is the generic term adopted in this guideline \nto describe any of the behaviors listed above. \nThe Controlled Substances Act (\u201cCSA\u201d) makes it illegal under Federal law to \nmanufacture, possess, or distribute certain drugs, including marijuana. (Controlled \nSubstances Act, 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 801, et seq. See \u00a7 844). All controlled substances are \nclassified into five schedules, based on their accepted medical uses, their potential for \nabuse, and their psychological and physical effects on the body. \u00a7\u00a7811, 812.

Raich, 545 U.S. 1 (2005). \nFurther, in October 2014, the Director of National Intelligence (DNI) issued a \nmemorandum entitled \u201cAdherence to Federal Laws Prohibiting Marijuana Use,\u201d (2014 \nDNI Memo) which makes clear that changes in the laws pertaining to marijuana by the \nvarious states, territories, and the District of Columbia do not alter the existing National \nSecurity Adjudicative Guidelines, and that Federal law supersedes state laws on this \nissue: \n[C]hanges to state laws and the laws of the District of Columbia pertaining \nto marijuana use do not alter the existing National Security Adjudicative \nGuidelines. . . . An individual\u2019s disregard of federal law pertaining to the \nuse, sale, or manufacture of marijuana remains adjudicatively relevant in \nnational security determinations. As always, adjudicative authorities are \nexpected to evaluate claimed or developed use of, or involvement with, \nmarijuana using the current adjudicative criteria. The adjudicative authority \nmust determine if the use of, or involvement with, marijuana raises \nquestions about the individual\u2019s judgment, reliability, trustworthiness, and \nwillingness to comply with law, rules, and regulations, including federal \nlaws, when making eligibility decisions of persons proposed for, or \noccupying, sensitive national security positions. \nThe DOHA Appeal Board, which I am required to follow, has cited the 2014 DNI \nMemo in holding that \u201cstate laws allowing for the legal use of marijuana in some limited \ncircumstances do not pre-empt provisions of the Industrial Security Program, and the \nDepartment of Defense is not bound by the status of an applicant\u2019s conduct under state \nlaw when adjudicating that individual\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\u201d \nISCR Case No. 14-03734 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Feb. 18, 2016).  \nThe current National Security Adjudicative Guidelines went into effect on June 8, \n2017, after the 2014 DNI memo was issued. Nevertheless, the principle continues to \napply. \nMoreover, on December 21, 2021, DNI Avril D. Haynes issued a memorandum \nentitled, \u201cSecurity Executive Clarifying Guidance Concerning Marijuana for Agencies \nConducting Adjudications of Persons Proposed for Eligibility for Access to Classified \nInformation or Eligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position.\u201d (2021 DNI Memo) The memo \nincorporates the AGs (at reference B) and the 2014 DNI Memo (at reference G) among \nvarious other relevant federal laws, executive orders, and memoranda. I take \nadministrative notice of the 2021 DNI memo here, given its relevance to this case, its \nreliance on the AGs, and its recency.  \nThe 2021 DNI memo specifically notes that \u201cunder policy set forth in SEAD 4's \nadjudicative guidelines, the illegal use or misuse of controlled substances can raise \nsecurity concerns about an individual's reliability and trustworthiness to access \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nclassified information or to hold a sensitive position, as well as their ability or willingness \nto comply with laws, rules, and regulations.\u201d Thus, consistent with these references, the \nAGs indicate that \u201cdisregard of federal law pertaining to marijuana remains relevant, but \nnot determinative, to adjudications of eligibility for access to classified information or \neligibility to hold a sensitive position.\u201d (2021 DNI Memo) \nI have considered the disqualifying conditions for drug involvement under AG \u00b6 \n25, and the following are potentially applicable: \n(a) any substance misuse (see above definition); and \n(c) illegal possession of a controlled substance, including cultivation, \nprocessing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of \ndrug paraphernalia. \nApplicant\u2019s use of Adderall and ketamine without a prescription establishes AG \u00b6 \n25(a) since misuse of prescription drugs is considered an illegal use of a controlled \nsubstance, as addressed in AG \u00b6 24. His use of marijuana, cocaine, LSD, PCP, and \npsychedelic mushrooms establishes AG \u00b6 25(a). AG \u00b6 25(c) is also applicable to \nApplicant\u2019s cultivation, purchase, sale, distribution, and possession of illegal drugs. \nI have considered the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 26. The following are \npotentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \nand \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this \nproblem, and has established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not \nlimited to: (1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; (2) \nchanging or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; and (3) \nproviding a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug involvement \nand substance misuse, acknowledging that any future involvement is \ngrounds for revocation of national security eligibility. \nNo mitigating conditions fully apply. Applicant\u2019s illegal substance use was not \ninfrequent and not isolated. While some of Applicant\u2019s illegal drug use was college-era \nexperimentation, he also used marijuana daily up to at least June 2020, if not June \n2022. He also used cocaine as well as hallucinogenic drugs like mushrooms, PCP, and \nLSD. He purchased marijuana and both sold and purchased LSD to finance his own \ndrug use. His drug involvement is also recent, as, at best, it ended about three years \nago. He also did not establish that he has disassociated from drug-using associates and \ncontacts, or that he has changed or avoided the environment where drugs were used. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nHis marijuana use continued after college, and he acknowledged driving out of state to \npurchase marijuana for his home use. The only changed circumstance appears to be \nhis desire to hold a clearance. \nApplicant\u2019s recent assertions that he understands that marijuana use is federally \nillegal, and that illegal drug use is incompatible with holding a security clearance, as well \nas his assertions that he no longer intends to use marijuana must be balanced against \nhis overall record. Further, Applicant offered no mitigating evidence in responding to the \nGovernment\u2019s FORM. \nSince Applicant elected a decision on the written record, in lieu of a hearing, I did \nnot have the opportunity to ask him questions about his conduct. I also had no \nopportunity to observe his demeanor during a hearing, and thus, to assess his credibility \nbeyond the documentary record. The fact that I cannot assess his credibility undercuts \nthe strength of his case in mitigation. The recency of his most recent use, and its \ncircumstances, preclude full application of either AG \u00b6 26(a) or AG \u00b6 26(b). \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments \nunder Guideline H in my whole-person analysis. I conclude Applicant did not provide \nsufficient evidence to mitigate the security concerns about his drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse. Overall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts \nas to Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance. \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline H:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.h: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances, it is not clearly consistent with the national \ninterest to grant Applicant a security clearance.

Over the years he has \naccumulated extensive experience and has recently completed formal training with \nHonda.  His current financial situation is tight.  He often brings home about $2,000 bi-\nweekly after taxes.  With his regular monthly expenses of rent in the amount of $1,965, \nfood, utilities, as well as repair expenses for a truck his father gave him that needs work, \nhe has little discretionary money.  He has $200 in a savings account, $2,800 in his \nchecking account, and $2,500 in his retirement account. \nSince late 2020, or early 2021, Applicant has been employed full time, however \nhe has changed jobs and worked for several employers with an effort to find stability, \nbetter pay, and opportunity for growth. \nIn October 2022, he received an offer of \nemployment with a defense contractor dependent on his security clearance. Applicant \ncompleted a security clearance application dated November 14, 2022. \nThis is \nApplicant\u2019s first time applying for a security clearance. \nApplicant stated that in 2019 when the COVID shutdown began and became \nworse through 2020, his ability to work and earn a living was significantly impacted. In \n2019, he was furloughed from his job with Honda for about two months without pay. \nThis forced him to open credit card debt to simply survive.

This was a dirt bike/motorcycle that Applicant leased from a \ndealership. \nThe payments were $183 monthly. \nApplicant made the monthly \npayments until late 2021, when work slowed down, and he could no longer afford \nthem. He has not made a payment in about a year. Applicant intends to pay the \ndebt as he wants to keep the motorcycle. (Tr. p. 27.) The debt remains owing. \n1.b. A delinquent debt owed to a creditor was charged off in the approximate amount \nof $5,167. This is a credit card that Applicant opened in 2017 and used to pay rent, \nhealth insurance, food, and the essentials to survive. (Tr. p. 29.) In late 2021, work \nslowed down, and he stopped making payments on the account. Applicant stated \nthat about two months ago, he made a couple of $400 payments.

This is a pay pal account or credit line that Applicant \nobtained in 2019. He initially used the money to pay for his hobby involving RC \nhelicopters, and ultimately had to use it to help pay for rent and living expenses. He \nhas not made a payment for about a year.

In the past seven \nyears have you had any account or credit card suspended, charged off, or cancelled for \nfailing to pay as agreed?\u201d Applicant answered, \u201cNo.\u201d Applicant failed to disclose the \ndelinquent debts set forth above in subparagraphs 1.a., through 1.k. \nApplicant gave several excuses for not answering the questions accurately.

In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. The entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of \nvariables known as the whole-person concept. The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance \ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAnalysis \nGuideline F - Financial Considerations \nThe security concern for Financial Considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. Two are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nDue to COVID and its aftermath, Applicant incurred significant delinquent debt \nthat he has not paid. At this time there is insufficient information in the record to \nconclude that he is financially stable, or that he can afford his lifestyle, or that he has the \nfinancial resources available to handle his financial obligations. There is no evidence in \nthe record to show that any regular monthly payments of any sort are being made \ntoward his debts. In fact, they all remain outstanding. The evidence is sufficient to raise \nthe above disqualifying conditions. \nThe following mitigating conditions under Financial Considerations are potentially \napplicable under AG \u00b6 20. \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g. loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce, or \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n   \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nseparation, clear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity \ntheft), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control; \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \nThere is evidence to show that circumstances beyond the Applicant\u2019s control, \nnamely the impact of COVID, contributed to Applicant\u2019s financial debts. There were \nseveral periods of unemployment resulting in a total of about five months without \nincome. However, since late 2020 or early 2021, Applicant has been working full time \nand has done very little to show that he has addressed his delinquent indebtedness. \nFurthermore, he has failed to provide any documentation to support his contentions that \nhe has made a \u201cfew payments\u201d toward two or three of his debts. None of the mitigating \nconditions apply. This guideline is found against Applicant. \nGuideline E - Personal Conduct \nThe security concern for the personal conduct guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 15: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process. \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. The following disqualifying condition is potentially applicable: \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or \nsimilar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment \nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine national security \neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities. \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 17 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. I have \nconsidered each of the mitigating conditions below: \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, \nunreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely \nto recur; \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate \nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress; \n(f) the information was unsubstantiated or from a source of questionable \nreliability; and \n(g) association with persons involved in criminal activities was unwitting, \nhas ceased, or occurs under circumstances that do not cast doubt upon \nthe individual's reliability, trustworthiness, judgment, or willingness to \ncomply with rules and regulations. \nApplicant was not candid and truthful when he answered the questions on his \nsecurity clearance application about his past financial record. This shows irresponsible \nand unreliable conduct. Whether he was careless or dishonest his conduct shows poor \njudgment. \nApplicant knew or should have known to answer the questions on his \napplication carefully and accurately. Deliberately concealing material information from \nthe government on a security clearance application raises serious questions about \none\u2019s \ncredibility \nand \ntrustworthiness. \nCarelessness \nshows immaturity and \nirresponsibility. In either case, none of the mitigating conditions are applicable here, \nand Applicant does not meet the eligibility requirement to access classified information. \nThis guideline is found against the Applicant. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nrelevant facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant has not addressed \nhis financial delinquencies and was not candid with the Government about his financial \nhistory. Insufficient mitigation has been shown. Accordingly, I conclude Applicant has \nnot mitigated the Financial Considerations and Personal Conduct security concerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a. through 1.k. \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 2.a. \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s national \nsecurity eligibility for a security clearance.

He resides with his mother and three siblings, ages 31, 24, and 17. (GE 2) On August 3, 2020, Applicant certified and submitted an Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing (e-QIP). Under Section 26 - Financial Record, he reported five delinquent accounts and his intent to file a Chapter 7 bankruptcy petition to resolve these accounts. (GE 3) On January 13, 2021, Applicant was interviewed by an authorized investigator on behalf of the Office of Personnel Management (OPM). During the interview, Applicant reported that he was in the process of filing a Chapter 7 bankruptcy petition to resolve at least twelve delinquent accounts. Applicant explained that his father left Applicant's mother and siblings in early 2019, and Applicant then began contributing payments for the household expenses, such as rent, utilities and groceries. Applicant had not initiated any payment arrangements or made any payments towards his delinquent accounts, however, and he intended to file bankruptcy. As of the interview, his monthly income was approximately $2,300 and his monthly expenses were approximately $2,100 to $2,600.

In the FORM, Department Counsel \nprovided Applicant notice that failure to respond to the FORM may be considered a waiver \nof any objections to the proffered exhibits. \nOn July 20, 2023, Applicant submitted his response to the FORM, including his \ntwo-page statement (Applicant Exhibit (AE) A), a five-page statement from the debt-\nresolution company (AE B), and payment arrangements regarding three accounts (AE \nC-E). The case was assigned to me on November 3, 2023. AE A through E and GE 1 \nthrough 7 are admitted without objection. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant is 28 years old. Since May 2015, he has served part-time in the U.S. \nArmy Reserve. He has been employed full time as an engineering technician for a DOD \ncontractor since October 2018. He is not married and has no children. He resides with his \nmother and three siblings, ages 31, 24, and 17. (GE 2) \nOn August 3, 2020, Applicant certified and submitted an Electronic Questionnaire \nfor Investigations Processing (e-QIP). Under Section 26 - Financial Record, he reported \nfive delinquent accounts and his intent to file a Chapter 7 bankruptcy petition to resolve \nthese accounts. (GE 3) \nOn January 13, 2021, Applicant was interviewed by an authorized investigator on \nbehalf of the Office of Personnel Management (OPM). During the interview, Applicant \nreported that he was in the process of filing a Chapter 7 bankruptcy petition to resolve at \nleast twelve delinquent accounts. Applicant explained that his father left Applicant's \nmother and siblings in early 2019, and Applicant then began contributing payments for \nthe household expenses, such as rent, utilities and groceries. Applicant had not initiated \nany payment arrangements or made any payments towards his delinquent accounts, \nhowever, and he intended to file bankruptcy. As of the interview, his monthly income was \napproximately $2,300 and his monthly expenses were approximately $2,100 to $2,600. \n(GE 7) \nThe SOR alleges 11 delinquent debts; however, SOR \u00b6 1.k is a duplicate debt of \nSOR \u00b6 1.f. SOR \u00b6 1.k. is found for Applicant. The remaining 10 delinquent accounts total \napproximately $23,362. Applicant's admissions and the three credit reports indicate that \nthese 10 accounts became delinquent in about 2019. There is no evidence of any \npayments or payment arrangements regarding these 10 delinquent accounts between \ntheir delinquency and the May 2023 issuance of the SOR. (GE 3-7) \nWith his June 2023 Answer, Applicant attached five payments, totaling $1,410, \nbetween July 2020 and October 2020 for bankruptcy attorney's fees. The correspondence \nfrom the attorney's office indicates that Applicant needed to gather and submit \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ndocumentation related to an anticipated bankruptcy filing and needed to complete a credit-\ncounseling course. There is no evidence of a bankruptcy filing or completed credit \ncounseling. Applicant also included documentation of one $250 payment to the DRC. \n(Answer) \nIn Applicant's July 2023 response to the FORM, he reiterated that he had \nexperienced financial hardship when his father separated from his mother. He explained \nthat his father later died, and Applicant paid some or all of the unspecified funeral costs. \nHe disclosed that he did not file bankruptcy and that he had engaged the DRC in May \n2023 to settle his delinquent accounts. Applicant's DRC plan includes six of the alleged \ndebts (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d.-1.i.), and two creditors had accepted settlement terms. A third creditor \n(SOR \u00b6 1.d.) has proposed a repayment plan; however, there is no evidence of any \npayments by Applicant. As of the close of the record, Applicant has provided documentary \nevidence of one $250 payment to the DRC to pay fees and accrue savings for settlement. \n(FORM Response; Answer) \nApplicant's DRC plan does not address four debts (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a.-1.c., 1.j.), and \nthere is no evidence of a plan to address and resolve these accounts or actions in \nfurtherance of such a plan. Applicant has not provided any evidence of credit counseling \nor a current monthly budget. He has not provided any details as to any expenses he \nincurred associated with his father's funeral. \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant's suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant's eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in conjunction \nwith the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge's overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\"whole-person concept.\" The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \nThe protection of the national security is1 the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \"[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\" \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \"witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\" The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation of potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \"in terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\" See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nThe security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds .... \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under AG \n\u00b6 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant's 10 delinquent accounts total approximately $23,362. As explained \nabove, SOR \u00b6 1.k. is a duplicate debt and is found for Applicant. These debts have been \ndelinquent since at least 2019 and remain delinquent. AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and 19(c) apply. \nConditions that could mitigate the financial considerations security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 20. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe per\n \nson's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce, or separation, clear \nvictimization by\n \n predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; and \n(d) the individual has initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nApplicant bears the burdens of production and persuasion in mitigation. An \napplicant is not held to a standard of perfection in her debt-resolution efforts or required \nto be debt-free. \"Rather, all that is required is than an applicant act responsibly given his \ncircumstances and develop a reasonable plan for repayment; accompanied by \n'concomitant conduct,' that is, actions which evidence a serious intent to effectuate the \nplan.\" ISCR Case No. 15-02903 at 3 (App. Bd. Mar. 9, 2017). See, e.g., ISCR Case No. \n13-00987 at 3, n. 5 (App. Bd. Aug. 14, 2014). \nApplicant attributed his financial delinquencies to his parents' marital separation in \nearly 2019. His father left his mother and three siblings, and Applicant then began helping \nhis mother pay for rent, utilities, and groceries. His father later died. Applicant's credit \nreports show that the alleged accounts became delinquent in mid-to-late-2019. In late \n2020, Applicant made five payments, totaling $1,410, towards fees for a bankruptcy \nattorney; however, Applicant has not filed a bankruptcy petition. There is no evidence of \nany debt-resolution efforts between late 2020 and the May 2023 issuance of the SOR, \ndespite Applicant's submission of an e-QIP and his OPM interview alerting him to security \nconcerns about his financial delinquencies. \nUnder AG \u00b6 20(b), Applicant must establish circumstances largely beyond his \ncontrol and that he acted responsibly under the circumstances. Notwithstanding the \n---\nfinancial hardship of supporting his mother and siblings and his father's unspecified \nfuneral expenses, Applicant has not established that he acted responsibly to address and \nresolve his delinquent accounts. There is no evidence of any debt-resolution efforts for \nover two years, until prompted by the May 2023 SOR. Although Applicant has recently \nenrolled in a DRC program, it is too soon to conclude that he has demonstrated a track \nrecord of financial responsibility. None of the financial considerations mitigating concerns \napply. Applicant did not mitigate the f inancial considerations security concerns.  \nWhole-Person Concept  \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant's eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant's \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n____________________ \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the potentially \ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and circumstances \nsurrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under Guideline F and the \nfactors in AG \u00b6 2(d) in this whole-person analysis. \nApplicant has served honorably in the U.S. Army Reserve. Circumstances beyond \nhis control contributed to his financial delinquencies; however, he has not provided \nsufficient evidence to establish that he has acted responsibly to address and resolve his \nfinancial delinquencies. Applicant did not mitigate the financial considerations security \nconcerns. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nAGAINST APPLICANT  \nSubparagraphs 1.a.-1.j.:\nSubparagraph 1.k.: \nAgainst Applicant  \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, I conclude \nthat it is not clearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant Applicant \neligibility for a security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nEric H. Borgstrom \nAdministrative Judge \n6 \n",

In response to Section 26, Financial Record Delinquency \nInvolving Routine Accounts Other Than Previously Listed: Have any of the following \nhappened? . . . \u201cIn the past seven years have you had bills or debt turned over to a \ncollection agency? . . . In the past seven years, have you had any account or credit card \nsuspended, charged off, or cancelled for failing to pay as agreed?\u201d Applicant answered, \n\u201cNo,\u201d to both questions, and failed to list that he had been delinquent on debts in the \npast seven years, as noted in Guideline F above. Applicant denied this allegation. \nUpon review of the security clearance application, Applicant failed to list any \nindebtedness. Given his significant debt, it can be presumed that he deliberately sought \nto conceal this information from the Government on the application. \nDuring Applicant\u2019s subject interview in February 2023, the investigator confronted \nhim with the debt by reviewing Applicant\u2019s credit report. At that time, Applicant admitted \nthe debt. (Government Exhibit 3.) In his answer to the SOR, Applicant stated that when \nhe went over the debts with the investigator, he was told that he could make changes \non the security clearance questionnaire if he chose to. Applicant did not have any \nchanges that he wanted to make. (Government Exhibit 1.) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for national security eligibility, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. The entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of \nvariables known as the whole-person concept. The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n      \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance \ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F -  Financial Considerations \nThe security concern for Financial Considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. Three are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts;  \n(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so; and  \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant incurred significant delinquent debt that he has not paid. At this time \nthere is insufficient information in the record to conclude that he is financially stable, or \nthat he can afford his lifestyle, or that he has the financial resources available to resolve \nhis financial obligations. There is no evidence in the record to show that any regular \nmonthly payments of any sort are being made toward his debts. The evidence is \nsufficient to raise the above disqualifying conditions. \nThe following mitigating conditions under Financial Considerations are potentially \napplicable under AG \u00b6 20. \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g. loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce, or \nseparation, clear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity \ntheft), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control;  \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nIt is noted that Applicant\u2019s earlier employment lay-offs have contributed to his \nexcessive indebtedness. However, he has been gainfully employed since August 2019, \nfor the past four years. There is still no evidence to show that he has made any effort to \nresolve his debts. None of the mitigating conditions apply. This guideline is found \nagainst Applicant. \nGuideline E - Personal Conduct \nThe security concern for the personal conduct guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 15: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process. \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. The following disqualifying condition is potentially applicable: \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or \nsimilar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment \nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine national security \neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities. \nAG \u00b6 17 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. I have \nconsidered each of the mitigating conditions below: \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, \nunreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely \nto recur; \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate \nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress; and \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(f) the information was unsubstantiated or from a source of questionable \nreliability. \nApplicant deliberately attempted to conceal his financial history from the \ngovernment on his security clearance application. \nThere is no excuse for this \ndishonesty. Deliberately concealing material information from the Government on a \nsecurity clearance application raises serious questions about one\u2019s credibility and \ntrustworthiness. None of the mitigating conditions are applicable. This guideline is \nfound against Applicant. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nrelevant facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant was given an \nopportunity to provide documentation to show that he is resolving his delinquent \nindebtedness. \nHe failed to submit any documentation to show that he has done \nanything to resolve his debts. Thus, it can be presumed that he is not addressing the \ndebts in any form or fashion. Furthermore, he was not candid with the Government on \nhis security clearance application concerning his financial history. Applicant did not \nsubmit a response to the FORM. Insufficient mitigation has been shown. Accordingly, I \nconclude Applicant has not mitigated the Financial Considerations, and Personal \nConduct security concerns. \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a., through 1.k. \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 2.a. \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s national \nsecurity eligibility for a security clearance.

He worked in educational \ninstitutions in Russia and was a department head at one of the institutions. He is \nconcurrently a professor at a Russian university. (FORM Item 4; FORM Item 5) \nApplicant was the co-author of a few papers that his former advisor presented at \ninternational conferences. (FORM Item 41) His former advisor told him that he could \nobtain a post-doctorate position for him at a European university, because he had spent \nmost of his career in Europe and had connections. (FORM Item 3 at 40) \nWhen Applicant was interviewed by a security investigator in April 2022, he told \nthe investigator that he believed his mentor was a dual U.S.-Russian citizen, but he was \nnot sure. He also believed that his former advisor had worked on projects with the U.S. \nAir Force while he was in Russia, but he was unfamiliar with the details. (FORM Item 6 at \n2-3) \nThe Russian Federation has a highly centralized, authoritarian political system \ndominated by President Putin. The bicameral federal assembly consists of a directedly\u00ad\nelected lower house and an appointed upper house, both of which lack independence \nfrom the executive. The 2018 presidential election and the 2021 lower house elections \nwere marked by accusations of government interference and manipulation of the electoral \nprocess, including the exclusion of meaningful opposition candidates. The Russian \ngovernment uses arbitrary designations, criminal convictions, and administrative barriers \nto disqualify potential opposition candidates, ensuring that no independent voices can \nparticipate in government processes. \nIn response to the 2014 Russian violation of Ukraine\u2019s sovereignty and territorial \nintegrity, the United States suspended the Bilateral Presidential Commission, a body \njointly founded in 2009 by the United States and Russian to promote cooperation between \nthe two countries. Russia has attempted to position itself as a competitor to the United \nStates by undermining norms within the existing international system, aiming to \nundermine core institutions of the West, such as the North Atlantic Treaty Organization \n(NATO) and the European Union, and to weaken faith in the democratic and free-market \nsystem. \nRussia is one of the top three most aggressive and capable collectors of economic \ninformation and technological intelligence from U.S. sources. Russia provides military and \nmissile technologies to countries of security concern, including China, Iran, Syria, and \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nVenezuela. Russian military programs continue to be driven by the perception that the \nUnited States and NATO are its principal strategic challenges and greatest potential \nthreat. \nRussia uses cyber operations as an instrument of intelligence collection, using \nsophisticated and large-scale hacking to collect sensitive information, influence the \npolitical process in the United States, and undermine Euro-Atlantic unity. Russia also \nuses commercial and academic enterprises that interact with the West, recruitment of \nRussian immigrants with advanced technical skills, and penetration of public and private \nenterprises to obtain sensitive technical information. The areas of highest interest include \nalternative energy, biotechnology, defense technology, environmental protection, high-\nend manufacturing, and information and communications technology. Russian agents \nhave been involved in intrusions and hacking affecting U.S. citizens, corporate entities, \ninternational organizations, and political organizations in the United States. \nRelations between the United States and Russia have deteriorated significantly \nsince Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine. The United States has imposed sanctions on senior \nmembers of the Russian government and has imposed restrictions on the Russian \nfinancial system and its defense, aerospace, maritime, and other strategic sections of its \ngovernment. The U.S. Department of State has issued a Level 4 Travel Advisory for \nRussian (\u201cdo not travel\u201d) because of the invasion of Ukraine and the potential for \nharassment of U.S. citizens, including dual U.S. Russian nationals. \nIn February 2022, the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI) \nreported that Russia presents one of the most serious foreign influence threats to the \nUnited States, using its intelligence services, proxies, and other influence tools to \nundermine U.S. global standing, amplify discord inside the United States, and influence \nU.S. voters and decision making. Russia has conducted influence operations against U.S. \nelections for decades, including as recently as the 2020 presidential election.  \nODNI also reported that Russia considers cyber disruptions as a foreign policy \nlever to shape other countries\u2019 decisions, as well as a deterrence and military tool. Russia \nuses commercial and academic enterprises that interact with the West, recruits Russian \nimmigrants with advanced technical skills, and attempts to penetrate public and private \nenterprises. \nRussia\u2019s human rights record is uneven, and in some areas it is poor. The judiciary \nis not independent and is subject to manipulation by political authorities. Abuses include \nattacks on journalists, physical abuse by law enforcement officers, harsh prison \nconditions, arbitrary detention, politically motivated imprisonment, electronic surveillance \nwithout judicial permission, warrantless searches of residences and other premises, and \nwidespread corruption in the executive, legislative, and judicial branches. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \nPolicies \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 2. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge \napplies these guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \n\u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 15-01253 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2016). \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts.

See ISCR Case No. 02-\n31154 at 5 (App. Bd.

Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \nAnalysis \nGuideline B, Foreign Influence \nThe security concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 6: \nForeign contacts and interests, including, but not limited to, business, \nfinancial, and property interests, are a national security concern if they result \nin divided allegiance. They may also be a national security concern if they \ncreate circumstances in which the individual maybe manipulated or induced \nto help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a way \ninconsistent with U.S. interests or otherwise made vulnerable to pressure \nor coercion by any foreign interest. Assessment of foreign contacts and \ninterests should consider the country in which the foreign contact or interest \nis located, including, but not limited to, considerations such as whether it is \nknown to target U.S. citizens to obtain classified or sensitive information or \nis associated with a risk of terrorism. \nAG \u00b6 7(a) requires substantial evidence of a \u201cheightened risk.\u201d The \u201cheightened \nrisk\u201d required to raise one of these disqualifying conditions is a relatively low standard. \n\u201cHeightened risk\u201d denotes a risk greater than the normal risk inherent in living under a \nforeign government. See ISCR Case No. 12-05839 at 4 (App. Bd. Jul. 11, 2013). It is not \na high standard. See ISCR Case No.17-03026 at 5 (App. Bd. Jan. 16, 2019). It is a level \nof risk one step above a State Department Level 1 travel advisory (\u201cexercise normal \nprecaution\u201d) and equivalent to the Level 2 advisory (\u201cexercise increased caution\u201d) \nAn Applicant\u2019s ties to persons of high rank in a foreign government or military are \nof particular concern, insofar as it is foreseeable that through an association with such \npersons an applicant could come to the attention of those interested in acquiring U.S. \nprotected information. See ISCR Case No. 08-10025 at 2 and 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 3, 2009); \nISCR Case No.11-04980 at 2 and 6 (App. Bd. Sep. 21,2012); and ISCR Case No. 11-\n12632 at 2 and 5 (App. Bd. Feb. 2, 2015). An applicant with ties to a country that is hostile \nto the United States has a very heavy burden of persuasion to show that he or she is not \nsubject to influence by that country.

In Applicant\u2019s SCA, he described his \nrelationship with his mentor as \u201cmore than just professional.\u201d He has co-authored articles \nwith his former mentor. His former mentor has held senior positions in the Russian \ngovernment. Applicant is a neophyte is the world of classified information and may not \nrecognize subtle efforts to obtain information from him. \nThe following mitigating conditions are potentially applicable: \nAG \u00b6 8(a): the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country \nin which these persons are located, or the positions or activities of those \npersons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be placed \nin a position of having to choose between the interests of a foreign \nindividual, group, organization, or government and the interests of the \nUnited States; \nAG \u00b6 8(b): there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s \nsense of loyalty or obligation to the foreign person, or allegiance to the \ngroup, government, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such deep \nand longstanding relationships and loyalties in the United States, that the \nindividual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the \nU.S. interest; and \nAG \u00b6 8(c): contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and \ninfrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign \ninfluence or exploitation. \nAG \u00b6 8(a) is not established.

He has acknowledged that their relationship is more than just professional. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-\nperson concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process \nfactors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nI have incorporated my comments under Guideline B in my whole-person analysis \nand applied the adjudicative factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). Because Applicant requested a \ndetermination on the record without a hearing, I had no opportunity to evaluate his \ncredibility and sincerity based on demeanor. See ISCR Case No. 01-12350 at 3-4 (App. \nBd. Jul. 23, 2003). After weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under \nGuideline B and evaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude \nApplicant has not mitigated the security concerns raised by his continued contacts with a \nRussian national. \nFormal Findings \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \nParagraph 1, Guideline B, Foreign Influence: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 1.a: \nAgainst Applicant \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nConclusion \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national security interests of the \nUnited States to grant Applicant eligibility for access to classified information.

(Hearing Exhibit (HE) 2) \nThe SOR detailed reasons why the DCSA CAS did not find under the Directive \nthat it is clearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant or continue a \nsecurity clearance for Applicant and recommended referral to an administrative judge to \ndetermine whether a clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked. \nSpecifically, the SOR set forth security concerns arising under Guideline H.

(HE \n3) On June 28, 2023, Department Counsel was ready to proceed.   \nOn July 11, 2023, the case was assigned to me. On July 25, 2023, the Defense \nOffice of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a notice, setting the hearing for \nSeptember 19, 2023. (HE 1) The hearing was held as rescheduled. \nDepartment Counsel offered three exhibits into evidence, and Applicant did not \noffer any exhibits into evidence. (Transcript (Tr.) 11, 19-22; GE 1-GE 3) Applicant \nobjected to GE 3 because he believed several parts of the Office of Personnel \nManagement (OPM) personal subject interview (PSI) contained errors. (Tr. 21, 44-45) I \nsustained his objection to the OPM PSI. (Tr. 21) Applicant did not adopt or authenticate \nthe OPM PSI before the hearing. On September 28, 2023, DOHA received a transcript of \nthe hearing. Applicant provided five exhibits after his hearing, which were admitted \nwithout objection (AE A-AE E). The record closed on October 19, 2023. (Tr. 44-52) \nSome details were excluded to protect Applicant\u2019s right to privacy. Specific \ninformation is available in the cited exhibits and transcript. \nFindings of Fact \nIn Applicant\u2019s SOR response, he admitted the SOR allegations in \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through \n1.f. (HE 3) He also provided mitigating information. His admissions are accepted as\nfindings of fact. Additional findings follow.   \n \nApplicant is a 35-year-old software engineer who has worked for the same defense \ncontractor for 11 years. (Tr. 7, 8, 24) In 2006, he graduated from high school, and in 2013, \nhe was awarded a bachelor of science degree in mechanical engineering. (Tr. 7; AE C) \nHe expects to receive a master\u2019s degree in business administration (MBA) in 2024. (Tr. \n7-8; AE C) He has not married, and he does not have any children. (Tr. 8) He has never \nserved in the military. (Tr. 8) \nIn 2021, Applicant worked on the commercial side of the defense contractor\u2019s \nbusiness. (Tr. 29) He was not working on defense projects. (Tr. 29) In 2022, he shifted to \nsoftware and working with defense matters. (Tr. 48) He believed his company policy was \nto comply with local law concerning drug use, and in his state marijuana use is legal. (Tr. \n29-30) Use of illegal drugs at work is prohibited. (Tr. 30) \nDrug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nOn September 6, 2022, Applicant responded to DOHA interrogatories and \nprovided the recency and frequency in which he used various illegal drugs. (GE 2 at 2) \nHe agreed at his hearing that those answers were correct.

He used marijuana once or twice a year from 2016 to \nJuly 2021. (Tr. 25; GE 1 at 49) He smoked marijuana once and ate CBD edibles or \ngummies about six times in 2021. (Tr. 26, 28, 47) He was unsure if the CBD edibles \ncontained tetrahydrocannabinol (THC). (Tr. 26) He ate Cannabidiol (CBD) edibles on \nseveral weekends because he had pain in his back, and the CBD edibles helped him \nsleep. (Tr. 27, 47) He has improved his office equipment and received therapy to help \nwith his back pain. (Tr. 36) His most recent use of an illegal drug involved his consumption \nof CBD in July 2021 or smoking a marijuana joint earlier in 2021. \nSOR \u00b6 1.b alleges Applicant used hallucinogenic mushrooms with varying \nfrequency from about August 2014 to about July 2016. He said he used mushrooms three \ntimes while hiking with others in the woods. (GE 1 at 50) The most recent use of \nmushrooms was in July 2016 while with friends camping. (Id.) \nSOR \u00b6 1.c alleges Applicant used cocaine with varying frequency from about May \n2015 to about July 2018. He used cocaine a total of three times: once in 2015; once in \n2016; and once in 2018. (Tr. 31-32) When he used cocaine the first two times, he ingested \nfour lines or bumps. (Tr. 31) The third time he ingested one line of cocaine at a friend\u2019s \nbachelor\u2019s party in 2018. (Tr. 30-31) \nSOR \u00b6 1.d alleges Applicant used 3,4-Methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) \nor ecstasy on at least one occasion on approximately May 2016. He received a dose of \necstasy from a friend at a music concert in May 2016, and he used the ecstasy. (GE 1 at \n51; GE 2 at 2) \nSOR \u00b6 1.e alleges Applicant misused the prescription medication, Xanax, which \nwas not prescribed to him, on at least one occasion in approximately October 2015. \nApplicant said a friend gave him one half of a Xanax pill when he was in a bar, and he \nused the Xanax in October 2015. (GE 1 at 52; GE 2 at 2) \nSOR \u00b6 1.f alleges Applicant used LSD on at least one occasion in approximately \nMay 2016. He said he used LSD at a music concert in May 2016. (GE 1 at 50; GE 2 at 2) \nApplicant voluntarily and truthfully reported his use of illegal drugs. (Tr. 18) He \nregretted his poor decisions to use illegal drugs. (Tr. 17, 49) At the time he was \nexperimenting with illegal drugs, he did not realize or appreciate the problematic nature \nof this illegal drug use. (Tr. 17) Since 2021, he consumes less than one alcoholic \nbeverage per month. (Tr. 18) \nApplicant ended his illegal drug use because he is more mature. (Tr. 34) He is \ndiligently trying to improve himself. (Tr. 49) He ended his experimentation with illegal \ndrugs, and he does not attend parties and concerts where drugs are used. (Tr. 36) He \nhas a good relationship with his girlfriend, and he wants to live a healthy lifestyle. (Tr. 34) \nHe has ended his associations with his drug-using associates. (Tr. 17, 34-35) He has no \nintention of using illegal drugs in the future.

(AE D; AE E) He contributes to his company. \nPolicies \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the Executive \nBranch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security emphasizing, \n\u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. \n518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to control \naccess to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual \nis sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The President \nhas authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicant\u2019s eligibility for \naccess to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \nIndustry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nabout potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Clearance \ndecisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a \ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 7. \nThus, nothing in this decision should be construed to suggest that it is based, in whole or \nin part, on any express or implied determination about applicant\u2019s allegiance, loyalty, or \npatriotism. It is merely an indication the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the \nPresident, Secretary of Defense, and Director of National Intelligence have established \nfor issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information.

Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 at 2 \n(App. Bd. May 2, 1996). \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it \nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his [or her] security \nclearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). The burden of \ndisproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-\n31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b).  \nAnalysis \nDrug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nAG \u00b6 24 provides the security concern arising from drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse stating: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior may \nlead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises questions \nabout a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, and \nregulations. Controlled substance means any \u201ccontrolled substance\u201d as \ndefined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term adopted in \nthis guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above. \nAG \u00b6 25 provides conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying in this case: \u201c(a) any substance misuse (see above definition)\u201d; and \u201c(c) \nillegal possession of a controlled substance, including cultivation, processing, \nmanufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of drug paraphernalia.\u201d The \nrecord establishes AG \u00b6\u00b6 25(a) and 25(c). Additional discussion of the disqualifying \nconditions is in the mitigation section, infra. \nAG \u00b6 26 lists four conditions that could mitigate security concerns: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened\nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt\non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n \n5 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and substance \nmisuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and \nhas established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not limited to: (1) \ndisassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; (2) changing or \navoiding the environment where drugs were used; and (3) providing a \nsigned statement of intent to abstain from all drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, acknowledging that any future involvement or misuse is \ngrounds for revocation of national security eligibility; \n(c) abuse of prescription drugs was after a severe or prolonged illness \nduring which these drugs were prescribed, and abuse has since ended; and \n(d) satisfactory completion of a prescribed drug treatment program, \nincluding, but not limited to, rehabilitation and aftercare requirements, \nwithout recurrence of abuse, and a favorable prognosis by a duly qualified \nmedical professional. \nIn ISCR Case No. 10-04641 at 4 (App. Bd. Sept. 24, 2013), the DOHA Appeal \nBoard concisely explained Applicant\u2019s responsibility for proving the applicability of \nmitigating conditions as follows: \nOnce a concern arises regarding an Applicant\u2019s security clearance \neligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance of \na security clearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th \nCir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991). After the Government \npresents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the \napplicant to rebut or mitigate those concerns. See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. The \nstandard applicable in security clearance decisions is that articulated in \nEgan, supra. \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access \nto classified information will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nDirective, Enclosure 2, [App. A] \u00b6 2(b).   \nApplicant admitted that he possessed and used marijuana, cocaine, LSD, \nhallucinogenic mushrooms, MDMA or ecstasy, and the prescription medication, Xanax, \nwhich was not prescribed to him. The drugs he used are listed on Schedules I through IV \nof the Controlled Substances Act. See 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 812(c); Drug Enforcement \nAdministration listing at https://www.dea.gov/drug-information/drug-scheduling. \nThe Security Executive Agent (SecEA) promulgated clarifying guidance \nconcerning marijuana-related issues in security clearance adjudications as follows: \n[Federal] agencies are instructed that prior recreational marijuana use by \nan individual may be relevant to adjudications but not determinative. The \nSecEA has provided direction in [the adjudicative guidelines] to agencies \nthat requires them to use a \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d This requires \nadjudicators to carefully weigh a number of variables in an individual\u2019s life \nto determine whether that individual\u2019s behavior raises a security concern, if \n6 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \nat all, and whether that concern has been mitigated such that the individual \nmay now receive a favorable adjudicative determination. Relevant \nmitigations include, but are not limited to, frequency of use and whether the \nindividual can demonstrate that future use is unlikely to recur, including by \nsigning an attestation or other such appropriate mitigation. Additionally, in \nlight of the long-standing federal law and policy prohibiting illegal drug use \nwhile occupying a sensitive position or holding a security clearance, \nagencies are encouraged to advise prospective national security workforce \nemployees that they should refrain from any future marijuana use upon \ninitiation of the national security vetting process, which commences once \nthe individual signs the certification contained in the Standard Form 86 (SF-\n86), Questionnaire for National Security Positions. \nSecurity Executive Agent Clarifying Guidance Concerning Marijuana for Agencies \nConducting Adjudications of Persons Proposed for Eligibility for Access to Classified \nInformation or Eligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position (Dec. 21, 2021) at 2 (quoted in ISCR \nCase No. 20-02974 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Feb. 1, 2022)). \nApplicant\u2019s decisions to repeatedly possess and use illegal drugs are an indication \nhe lacks the qualities expected of those with access to national secrets. However, he \nelected to end his misuse of drugs before he completed his SCA, and he disclosed his \ndrug involvement. His misuse of drugs was not discovered through a polygraph test, \ninvestigative efforts, or a urinalysis test. \nApplicant\u2019s involvement with illegal drugs is not recent, and I am convinced it \n\u201chappened under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur.\u201d AG \u00b6 26(a). His \ninvolvement with illegal drugs does not \u201ccast doubt on [his] current reliability, \ntrustworthiness, [and] good judgment.\u201d (Id.) His most recent use of an illegal drug involved \nhis consumption of CBD in July 2021, and he has established a sufficient pattern of \nabstention from illegal drugs. Guideline H security concerns are mitigated. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n7 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), \u201c[t]he ultimate determination\u201d of whether to grant a security \nclearance \u201cmust be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines\u201d and the whole-person concept. My comments under Guideline H are \nincorporated in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were \naddressed under that guideline but some warrant additional comment. \nApplicant is a 35-year-old software engineer who has worked for the same defense \ncontractor for 11 years. In 2006, he graduated from high school, and in 2013, he was \nawarded a bachelor of science degree in mechanical engineering. He expects to receive \nan MBA in 2024. In 2022, he shifted to software and working with defense matters. He \nacknowledged that his change in employment in 2022 necessitates his compliance with \ndefense rules prohibiting use of illegal drugs. \nApplicant\u2019s supervisor and a friend provided character reference statements \nsupporting his access to classified information. Applicant has integrity and demonstrates \nprofessionalism. He has outstanding performance evaluations, and he received \nnumerous monetary and recognition awards. He contributes to the success of his \ncompany. \nApplicant\u2019s most recent consumption of an illegal drug was his consumption of a \nCBD gummy in July 2021, and smoking marijuana earlier that year. At that time, marijuana \nuse was authorized under state law. He consumed the CBD gummy to help with back \npain. He completed an SCA on March 1, 2022. He volunteered the information about his \nabuse of six different illegal drugs (includes use of Xanax without a prescription). He \ncredibly promised not to use illegal drugs in the future. \nIt is well settled that once a concern arises regarding an applicant\u2019s security \nclearance eligibility, there is a strong presumption against granting a security clearance. \nSee Dorfmont, 913 F. 2d at 1401. \u201c[A] favorable clearance decision means that the record \ndiscloses no basis for doubt about an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified \ninformation.\u201d ISCR Case No. 18-02085 at 7 (App. Bd. Jan. 3, 2020) (citing ISCR Case \nNo. 12-00270 at 3 (App. Bd. Jan. 17, 2014)). \nI have carefully applied the law, as set forth in Egan, Exec. Or. 10865, the Directive, \nthe AGs, and the Appeal Board\u2019s jurisprudence to the facts and circumstances in the \ncontext of the whole person. Applicant mitigated drug involvement and substance misuse \nsecurity concerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline H:  \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a through 1.f: \nFor Applicant \n8 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n______________________ \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly \nconsistent with the interests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for access to \nclassified information.

In 1998, when he was one year old, his parents moved with him to Poland, where he has resided ever since. He became a naturalized Polish citizen in 2006. Since at least 2015, he has resided with his parents. In 2021, he obtained a bachelor\u2019s degree from a Polish university. He was scheduled to obtain a master\u2019s degree from a Polish university in July 2023, but the record is not clear as to whether he did so.

He was born in the United States in 1997. \nIn 1998, when he was one year old, his parents moved with him to Poland, where he \nhas resided ever since. He became a naturalized Polish citizen in 2006. Since at least \n2015, he has resided with his parents. In 2021, he obtained a bachelor\u2019s degree from a \nPolish university. He was scheduled to obtain a master\u2019s degree from a Polish university \nin July 2023, but the record is not clear as to whether he did so. His classes for both \nthese degrees were funded by the Polish government. Since 2016, he has worked for a \nPolish company located in Poland. He has an employment offer from a U.S. defense \ncontractor. He has a Polish fianc\u00e9e, whom he planned to marry in August 2023, but his \ncurrent marital status is unclear. He has no children. (Items 2-4) \nApplicant\u2019s father holds U.S. and Polish citizenships. His mother holds U.S. and \nUkrainian citizenships. Prior to 1998, they lived in the United States for 20 years, but \nafter 1998, they have resided in Poland. Applicant\u2019s fianc\u00e9e is a citizen and resident of \nPoland. He and his fianc\u00e9e plan on living in Poland once they are married. He has two \nolder brothers who are citizens of the United States and Poland and reside in Poland. \nThere is no evidence that he has anything other than a close familial relationship with \nhis parents, siblings, and fianc\u00e9e. His closest friends are also citizens and resident of \nPoland. (Items 2-4) \nIn February 2023, when he submitted his Electronic Questionnaire for \nInvestigations Processing (SF 86), he reported that he holds a Polish passport that was \nvalid from October 2013 until October 2023. Between August 2014 and January 2023, \nhe reported that he traveled extensively using this Polish passport. He also traveled \nextensively using an earlier Polish passport that expired in 2016. He holds a valid U.S. \npassport that expires in 2025. Earlier, he held a U.S. passport that expired in 2016. He \nhad traveled using his current U.S. passport once when he visited the United States in \n2019, and his now expired U.S. passport when he visited the U.S. in 2015. He also \nused a U.S. passport to travel prior to obtaining Polish citizenship in 2006. (Items 3, 4) \nApplicant has never been a member of the Polish military. However, he has \nreceived education and healthcare benefits from the Polish government. He has voted \nin both Polish and U.S. elections. There is no evidence that he owns any real property \nin either the United States or Poland. He claimed that he has some family in the United \nStates, but he did not specify who they are or their relation to him. He and his fianc\u00e9e \nvisited his family in the United States once on an undisclosed date. He claimed that he \nis involved in U.S. civic and community organizations such as the Ukrainian Orthodox \nChurch of the USA. He acknowledged that he has few friends in the United States. \n(FORM Response; Items 3, 4 \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant claimed that his family in Poland could not be used to coerce or \nintimidate him into revealing classified information. He also claimed that his allegiance is \nto the United States, not Poland, and that he is willing to renounce his Polish \ncitizenship. (FORM Response; Item 2) \nIn Item 5, the Government included information from the U.S. Department of \nState as of September 2023, about the United States' relations with Poland and the \ncurrent conditions in that country. I take administrative notice of the information included \nin those documents including, but not limited to: \nThe United States and Poland are longstanding, staunch allies and are both \nmembers of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO). They partner closely on \npolicies involving counterterrorism, human rights, nonproliferation, economic growth, \nand energy security. The United States and Poland are involved in regular and recurring \njoint military exercises. Poland has a stable government, and it is a party to a bilateral \nagreement on business and economic relations with the United States. (Item 5) \nPolicies \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG), which became \neffective on June 8, 2017. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline B, Foreign Influence \nThe security concern for foreign influence is set out in AG \u00b6 6: \nForeign contacts and interests, including, but not limited to, business, \nfinancial, and property interests, are a national security concern if they \nresult in divided allegiance. They may also be a national security concern \nif they create circumstances in which the individual may be manipulated or \ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a \nway inconsistent with U.S. interests or otherwise made vulnerable to \npressure or coercion by any foreign interest. Assessment of foreign \ncontacts and interests should consider the country in which the foreign \ncontact or interest is located, including, but not limited to, considerations \nsuch as whether it is known to target U.S. citizens to obtain classified or \nsensitive information or is associated with a risk of terrorism. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 7. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) contact, regardless of method, with a foreign family member, business \nor professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or \nresident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of \nforeign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; and \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual's obligation to \nprotect classified or sensitive information or technology and the \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nindividual\u2019s desire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing \nthat information or technology. \nGuideline B is not limited to countries hostile to the United States. \u201cThe United \nStates has a compelling interest in protecting and safeguarding classified information \nfrom any person, organization, or country that is not authorized to have access to it, \nregardless of whether that person, organization, or country has interests inimical to \nthose of the United States.\u201d ISCR Case No. 02-11570 at 5 (App. Bd. May 19, 2004). \nThe \u201cheightened risk\u201d language in Disqualifying Condition \u00b6 7(a) addresses an \napplicant's foreign contacts, not necessarily the foreign country involved. See, e.g., \nISCR Case No. 08-0448 at 4 (App. Bd. Apr. 23, 2009) and ISCR Case No. 08-09211 at \n3-4 (App. Bd. Jan. 21, 2010). Depending upon the particular circumstances presented in \na case, one or more foreign contacts located in even a foreign country that is friendly to \nthe United States may create a \u201cheightened risk\u201d of foreign exploitation, inducement, \nmanipulation, pressure, or coercion. A \u201cheightened risk\u201d is not a high standard to meet. \nIt is a risk greater than the normal risk inherent in having a family member living under a \nforeign government. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 12-05839 at 4 (App. Bd. Jul. 11, 2013). \nExcept for one year right after he was born, Applicant has spent his entire life in \nPoland. Acknowledging that they are also U.S. citizens, all of his nuclear family are \nresidents of Poland, and all but his mother are also citizens of Poland. His fianc\u00e9e \n(possibly now his wife) is a citizen and resident of Poland. She is not a U.S. citizen. \nGiven the aforementioned principles regarding the potential for a \u201cheightened risk,\u201d I find \nthat these circumstances create a heightened risk of foreign exploitation, inducement, \nmanipulation, pressure, or coercion. \nApplicant's connections to his family members and to Poland itself present a \npotential conflict of interest. As a matter of common sense and human experience there \nis a rebuttable presumption that a person has ties of affection for, or obligation to, their \nimmediate family members. Application of the AG is not a comment on an applicant's \npatriotism but merely an acknowledgment that people may act in unpredictable ways \nwhen faced with choices that could be important to a loved one, such as a family \nmember. (ISCR Case No. 08-10025 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 3, 2009). AG \u00b6\u00b6 7(a) and 7(b) \nare established, shifting the burden to Applicant to provide substantial evidence of \nmitigation. \nConditions that could mitigate foreign influence security concerns are provided \nunder AG \u00b6 8. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in \nwhich these persons are located, or the positions or activities of those \npersons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be \nplaced in a position of having to choose between the interests of a foreign \nindividual, group, organization, or government and the interests of the \nUnited States; \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of \nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, or allegiance to the group, \ngovernment, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such deep and \nlongstanding relationships and loyalties in the United States, that the \nindividual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the \nU.S. interest;  \n(c) contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and \ninfrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign \ninfluence or exploitation; and \n(e) the individual has promptly complied with existing agency requirements \nregarding the reporting of contacts, requests, or threats from persons, \ngroups, or organizations from a foreign country. \nThere is no evidence that Applicant has anything but a close and continuing \nrelationship with Polish family members and friends. However, the close and collegial \nnature of the relationship between the United States and Poland, and the fact that \nneither Applicant nor any of his family members work for the Polish government or \nmilitary show that AG \u00b6 8(a) has some applicability. \nAG \u00b6 8(b) does not apply. Applicant has longstanding ties to Poland, including \nliving there almost his entire life, working there, going to school there, and having all his \nclose family and friends there. By contrast, he provides little evidence of deep and \nlongstanding ties to the United States. While he is a U.S. citizen and has some family \nmembers in the U.S., his ties to Poland far outweigh his ties to the United States. I \ncannot find that Applicant has shown that he will resolve any conflict of interest in favor \nof the U.S. interest. \nAG \u00b6 8(c) does not apply. There is no evidence that his contact with Applicant\u2019s \nfamily members who reside in Poland is anything other than close and continuing. \nAG \u00b6 8(e) has some applicability as Applicant has disclosed his foreign contacts \non his SF 86 and during his security interviews. \nGuideline C, Foreign Preference \nAG \u00b6 9 explains the concerns about foreign preference stating: \nWhen an individual acts in such a way as to indicate a preference for a \nforeign country over the United States, then he or she may provide \ninformation or make decisions that are harmful to the interests of the \nUnited States. Foreign involvement raises concerns about an individual's \njudgment, reliability, and trustworthiness when it is in conflict with U.S. \nnational interests or when the individual acts to conceal it. By itself; the \nfact that a U.S. citizen is also a citizen of another country is not \ndisqualifying without an objective showing of such conflict or attempt at \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \nconcealment. The same is true for a U.S. citizen's exercise of any right or \nprivilege of foreign citizenship and any action to acquire or obtain \nrecognition of a foreign citizenship. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 10. The following is potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) applying for and/or acquiring citizenship in any other country.  \nAfter being born a U.S. citizen, Applicant acquired Polish citizenship. He has \nlived in Poland since 1998. The above-referenced Guideline C disqualifying condition is \napplicable. \nConditions that could mitigate foreign influence security concerns are provided \nunder AG \u00b6 11. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) the foreign citizenship is not in conflict with U.S. national security\ninterests; \n \n(c) the individual has expressed a willingness to renounce the foreign \ncitizenship that is in conflict with U.S. national security interests; \n(e) the exercise of entitlements or benefits of foreign citizenship do not \npresent a national security concern; and \n(f) the foreign preference, if detected, involves a foreign country, entity, or \nassociation that poses a low national security risk. \nThe United States and Poland are allies and share many of the same national \nsecurity goals. Applicant has expressed a willingness to renounce his Polish citizenship. \nI find that all the aforementioned Guideline C mitigating conditions are applicable, and \nthe foreign preference security concerns are mitigated. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) The nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guideline B and Guideline C in my whole-person analysis. \nOverall, the record evidence showing Applicant\u2019s and his family\u2019s longstanding \nties to Poland, as opposed to their less significant ties to the United States, leaves me \nwith questions and doubts about Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security \nclearance. I conclude Applicant did not mitigate the foreign influence security concerns. \nHe mitigated the foreign preference security concerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline B: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.e: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline C: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 2.a: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIt is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for \na security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nBenjamin R. Dorsey \nAdministrative Judge \n8 \n",

Instead, recognizing the complexities of \nhuman behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the \nadjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, \nimpartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a \nconscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n       \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \nThe administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the \nperson, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable trustworthiness decision. \nA person who seeks access to sensitive information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \ngovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to sensitive information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nsensitive information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of sensitive information. \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe trustworthiness concern for financial considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise trustworthiness concerns \nunder AG \u00b6 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant has a history of financial problems, including a dismissed Chapter 7 \nbankruptcy case and delinquent debts. AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and 19(c) are applicable. \nConditions that could mitigate the financial considerations trustworthiness \nconcerns are provided under AG \u00b6 20.

He stated that he left a job in 2012 because a supervisor was \ndiscriminating against him. He felt that financial institutions used predatory lending \npractices. There was insufficient evidence for a finding that Applicant received anything \nother than what he sought from his creditors. His financial problems did not result from \nconditions that were largely beyond his control. \nThe Chapter 7 bankruptcy is probative because it shows that Applicant was \nunable to pay his debts. The bankruptcy was dismissed, and the delinquent debts are \nalleged under other allegations. The bankruptcy does not have any remaining \nindependent security significance. SOR \u00b6 1.a is mitigated. \nApplicant relies on the fact that creditors for the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.f \n($2,645) and 1.l ($3,489) charged off and cancelled the debts through an IRS Form \n1099-C. The Appeal Board has noted that \u201ca creditor\u2019s choice to charge off a debt for \naccounting purposes does not affect the debtor\u2019s obligation to the creditor.\u201d See ISCR \nCase No. 08-11983 at 2 (App. Bd. Jan. 28, 2011) (citing ISCR Case No. 09-01175 at 2 \n(App. Bd. May 11, 2010)). While he did not pay the debts, I am considering those \nspecific debts mitigated. \nIn July and August 2023, Applicant paid or settled the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 \n1.g ($1,572), 1.h ($1,452), 1.i ($868) and 1.o ($961).

ISCR Case No. 17-03229 at 6 (App. Bd. Jun. 7, 2019). \nThose factors will go toward consideration of Applicant\u2019s overall financial situation and \nunder the whole person, but those specific debts are mitigated. \nApplicant made minimal payments toward his other debts, which total more than \n$68,000. He stated that he intends to pay the remaining debts. However, intentions to \nresolve financial problems in the future are not a substitute for a track record of debt \nrepayment or other responsible approaches. See ISCR Case No. 11-14570 at 3 (App. \nBd. Oct. 23, 2013). \nThere is insufficient evidence for a determination that Applicant\u2019s financial \nproblems will be resolved within a reasonable period. I am unable to find that he acted \nresponsibly under the circumstances or that he made a good-faith effort to pay his \ndebts. His financial issues are recent and ongoing. They continue to cast doubt on his \ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. None of the above mitigating \nconditions are applicable. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a public trust position by considering the totality of the \napplicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should \nconsider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \npublic trust position must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments \nunder Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a public trust position. I conclude Applicant did \nnot mitigate the financial considerations trustworthiness concerns. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_______________________ \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.a: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.b-1.e: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.f-1.i: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.j-1.k: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.l: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.m-1.n: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.o: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.p: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIt is not clearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a \npublic trust position.

(AppXs A and B.) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nconjunction with the factors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious \nscrutiny of a number of variables known as the whole-person concept. The \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration \nof the possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline H - Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Drug Involvement and \nSubstance Misuse is set forth at AG \u00b6 24: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nindividual's reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior \nmay lead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. Controlled substance means any \"controlled substance\" \nas defined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term \nadopted in this guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above. \nThe guideline at AG \u00b6 25 contains seven conditions that could raise a security \nconcern and may be disqualifying. Two conditions are established: \n(a) any substance misuse (see above definition); and \n(c) illegal possession of a controlled substance, including cultivation, \nprocessing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of \ndrug paraphernalia. \nAppellant used both Ketamine and psychedelic mushrooms. He also purchased \npsychedelic mushrooms, twice. Therefore, AG \u00b6\u00b6 25 (a) and (c) are established. \nThe guideline at AG \u00b6 26 contains four conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns. Two conditions may be applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \nand \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this \nproblem, and has established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not \nlimited to: \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts;  \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were \nused; and  \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all \ndrug involvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that \nany future involvement or misuse is grounds for revocation \nof national security eligibility. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n        \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s last drug involvement was about 19 months ago. His usage was \nabout once a year, over a period of six years. Applicant no longer associates with those \npeople with whom he used drugs. He has signed a Statement of Intent eschewing any \nfuture drug involvement. \nDrug Involvement and Substance Misuse is found for \nApplicant. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of an applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \nAG \u00b6 2(b) requires each case must be judged on its own merits. Under AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security clearance \nmust be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the \nguidelines and the whole person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant is well respected at work \nand in his community. (AppXs C~F and J.) Overall, the record evidence leaves me \nwithout questions or doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security \nclearance. For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant mitigated the security concerns \narising from his drug involvement and substance misuse. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline H: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a.~1.c: \nFor Applicant \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_________________ \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant national security eligibility \nfor a security clearance.

He has only recently \nabstained from marijuana use and expressed his intent to abstain from marijuana in the \nfuture. Applicant's candor and exemplary work performance do not overcome the \nconcerns raised by his knowing and repeated violation of Federal and state drug laws. He \ndid not mitigate the drug involvement and substance misuse security concerns. Eligibility \nfor access to classified information is denied. \nStatement of the Case \nOn June 20, 2023, the Defense Counterintelligence and Security Agency \nConsolidated Adjudication Services (CAS) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to \nApplicant detailing security concerns under Guideline H (drug involvement and substance \nmisuse). The CAS acted under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense \n(DOD) Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review \nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines \nimplemented by the DOD on June 8, 2017. \n1 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nIn Applicant's July 19, 2023 response to the SOR, he admitted, with explanations, \nboth SOR allegations. He requested a hearing before a Defense Office of Hearings and \nAppeals (DOHA) administrative judge. (Answer) \nOn August 23, 2023, the Government was ready to proceed to hearing. I was \nassigned this case on November 3, 2023. On November 13, 2023, DOHA issued a Notice \nof Hearing, scheduling a hearing by video teleconference for November 28, 2023. The \nhearing proceeded as scheduled. The Government proffered two exhibits, which I \nadmitted as Government Exhibits (GE) 1 and 2 without objection. Applicant testified and \nproffered two exhibits, which I marked as Applicant Exhibits (AE) A and B. I admitted AE \nA without objection, and I sustained Department Counsel's objection to the admissibility \nof AE B, as discussed below. At Applicant's request, I held the record open until December \n12, 2023, for him to supplement the evidentiary record. DOHA received the hearing \ntranscript (Tr.) on December 5, 2023. On December 8, 2023, Applicant submitted a two-\npage exhibit, which I admitted as AE C without objection. Applicant confirmed that he had \nno further submissions, and the record closed on December 8, 2023. \nEvidentiary Ruling \nAt the hearing, Applicant introduced two photographs (AE 8) showing what \nappeared to be test vials with tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) markings with backgrounds of \nthe Government's discovery letter, dated August 23, 2023, and a computer monitor's \ncalendar, dated November 20, 2023. These two photographs did not show Applicant's \nname, a testing date, who administered the test, or instructions on reading results. \nApplicant proffered that he purchased two at-home drug tests, which exclusively tested \nfor THC. He himself provided the urine sample, conducted the test, and interpreted the \nresults. There was no evidence showing that Applicant adhered to any accepted testing \nprotocols or limitations specified in the urinalysis instructions. \nDepartment Counsel objected to the admissibility of AE B on the grounds of \nauthentication and relevance. I sustained Department Counsel's objection because the \nauthenticity and reliability concerns far outweighed the probative value of AE B. I left the \nrecord open until December 12, 2023, to provide Applicant the opportunity to participate \nin a urinalysis administered by an authorized facility or medical professional. I permitted \nApplicant to testify about purchasing and administering the at-home tests and his \nunderstanding of the test results. (Tr. 19-23) \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant is 28 years old. He earned a bachelor's degree in May 2017 and a \nmaster's degree in December 2022. He has never married, and he does not have any \nchildren.

He admitted that he intended to use marijuana in the future. \n(GE 1) \nOn February 24, 2023, Applicant was interviewed by an investigator on behalf of \nthe Office of Personnel Management (OPM). He admitted his marijuana use and purchase \nas reported in his e-QIP. He explained that he typically used marijuana at home or in \nvarious social settings. He had both purchased marijuana illegally and from state-licensed \ndispensaries. As of the interview, he had last used marijuana on February 23, 2023. He \nnoted that he used marijuana to help sleep and to relieve his anxiety, and he continued to \nsocialize with individuals who used illegal drugs. At the time of the interview, he did not \nintend to alter his daily use of marijuana; however, he was willing to stop if required for his \nemployment. (GE 2) \nIn his July 19, 2023 Answer, Applicant admitted his marijuana use from \"September \n2013 to the present.\" He argued that his marijuana use complied with the laws of his \nstate(s) where he resided at that time of his use. He disagreed with the position that his \nmarijuana use constituted a security concern, and he expressed his intent to abstain from \nfuture marijuana use. (Answer) \nAt the hearing, Applicant clarified his drug involvement. From about September \n2013 to March 2020, he typically used marijuana about once a month. From March 2020 \nto late June 2023, he used marijuana approximately two or three times a day. He admitted \nthat he used marijuana at least once after receiving the SOR. In late June 2023, he \nrecognized the gravity of the Government's security concerns arising from his drug \ninvolvement. He then ceased his marijuana use and decided to abstain from marijuana \nuse in the future, because he highly valued his job and wanted to show his willingness to \ncomply with Federal rules and regulations. (Tr. 27-30, 33, 37, 42) \nWhile in college in State B, Applicant illegally purchased or received marijuana \nfrom friends. After college, Applicant resided in State A. He would either illegally purchase \nmarijuana in State A or travel to State B (where recreational marijuana use was permitted \nunder State B laws), purchase marijuana, and then illegally transport that marijuana back \nto State A for his own use. He admitted that such transporting of marijuana across state \nlines was illegal. He last purchased marijuana in May 2023. With the exception of his time \nin college, he lived in State A. In State B, recreational marijuana use (for those over the \nage of 21) became legal in December 2016; however, no dispensaries opened until \nNovember 2018. In State A, recreational marijuana use (for those over the age of 21) \nbecame legal in July 2021; however, dispensaries were not opened until January 2023. \n(Answer; Tr. 24-25; 35-37) \nIn August 2023 and November 2023, Applicant purchased and administered an at-\nhome urinalysis test, which only tested for the presence of THC. He testified that he \nprovided the urine sample, administered the test, and interpreted the results as negative \nfor the presence of THC. On December 4, 2023, Applicant participated in a urinalysis \nadministered at a testing facility. He tested negative for all tested substances, including \nmarijuana.

He \nhad been aware, prior to January 2023, that marijuana was a Schedule I controlled \nsubstance. He defined his understanding of a Schedule I drug as \"a controlled substance \nthat has a high probability of abuse and has a high ability to be addictive.\" In his Answer \nand at hearing, he expressed his frustration with what he believed was the Federal \ngovernment's delay in adopting a less critical perspective on previous marijuana use in \nclearance adjudications. He specifically referenced pending Federal legislation proposing \nto reduce or eliminate the negative inferences of previous marijuana use upon applicants \nfor clearance eligibility. (Tr. 31-32, 42-50; Answer) \nApplicant submitted an excerpt of his personnel record, showing his promotions in \nNovember 2019 and October 2022. On November 2, 2023, he received an Achievement \nAward \"for his extraordinary teamwork and customer focus.\" On April 4, 2023, he received \nan Achievement Award for \"great teamwork, dedication, flexibility, and ownership.\" \nApplicant's supervisor and facility security officer (FSO) are unaware of his marijuana use. \n(AE A; Tr. 39-40) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant's suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant's eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in conjunction \nwith the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge's overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\"whole-person concept.\" The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \"[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\" \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \"witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\" The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to sensitive information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \nsensitive information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard sensitive information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation of potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of sensitive information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \"in terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\" See also EO 12968, Section 3.1 (b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline H: Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nThe security concern for drug involvement is set out in AG \u00b6 24: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual's reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior may \nlead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. Controlled substance means any \"controlled substance\" as \ndefined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term adopted in \nthis guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under AG \n\u00b6 25. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) any substance misuse (see above definition); \n(c) illegal possession of a controlled substance, including cultivation, \nprocessing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of \ndrug paraphernalia; and \n(g) expressed intent to continue drug involvement and substance misuse, \nor failure to clearly and convincingly commit to discontinue such misuse. \nMarijuana is a Schedule I controlled substance under Federal law pursuant to Title \n21, Section 812 of the United States Code. Schedule I drugs are those which have a high \npotential for abuse; have no currently accepted medical use in treatment in the United \nStates; and lack accepted safety for use of the drug under medical supervision. Section \n844 under Title 21 of the United States Code makes it unlawful for any person to knowingly \nor intentionally possess a controlled substance not obtained pursuant to a valid \nprescription. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nOn October 25, 2014, the then Director of National Intelligence (DNI) issued \nguidance that changes to laws by some states and the District of Columbia to legalize or \ndecriminalize the recreational use of marijuana do not alter existing federal law or the \nNational Security Adjudicative Guidelines, and that an individual's disregard of federal law \npertaining to the use, sale, or manufacture of marijuana remains adjudicatively relevant in \nnational security eligibility determinations. \nOn December 21, 2021, the DNI issued clarifying guidance concerning marijuana, \nnoting that prior recreational use of marijuana by an individual may be relevant to security \nadjudications, but is not determinative in the whole-person evaluation. Relevant factors in \nmitigation include the frequency of use and whether the individual can demonstrate that \nfuture use is unlikely to recur. \nBetween September 2013 and March 2020, Applicant used marijuana about once \na month. Between March 2020 and late June 2023, he used marijuana two to three times \na day. He illegally purchased marijuana and illegally transported it across state lines, in \nviolation of Federal and state drug laws. He knowingly and repeatedly violated Federal \nand state drug laws, with his use and purchase of marijuana, over several years. AG \u00b6\u00b6 \n25(a) and 25(c) apply. \nIn his January 2023 e-QIP and during his February 2023 security interview, \nApplicant expressed his intent to use marijuana in the future. AG \u00b6 25(g) applies. \nConditions that could mitigate the drug involvement security concerns are provided \nunder AG \u00b6 26. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; and \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and substance \nmisuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and \nhas established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not limited to: \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; \n(2) changing or\n \n avoiding the e\n nvironment where drugs were used; \nand \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that any future \ninvolvement or misuse is grounds for revocation of national security \neligibility. \nApplicant's illegal use and purchase of marijuana spanned nearly 10 years. He \nwillfully disregarded Federal drug laws, believing that his marijuana use was not a serious \nconcern and that Federal prohibitions were not aligned with public sentiment about \nmarijuana use. He used marijuana even after receiving the June 2023 SOR. He quit using \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nmarijuana and expressed his intent to abstain from future marijuana use only after his \nemployment and clearance eligibility were in jeopardy. Notwithstanding his statement of \nintent to abstain from all drug involvement, he has not established a pattern of abstinence \nsufficient to overcome his daily marijuana use between March 2020 and late June 2023. \nGiven the recency and frequency of Applicant's marijuana use, coupled with his full \nawareness of his violation of drug laws, doubts remain as to his judgment and ability to \nadhere to rules and regulations. Applicant has not mitigated the drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse security concerns. \nWhole-Person Concept  \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant's eligibility for a position of trust by considering the totality of the applicant's \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the potentially \ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and circumstances \nsurrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under Guideline H and the \nfactors in AG \u00b6 2(d) in this whole-person analysis. \nApplicant's candor and exemplary work performance do not overcome the \nconcerns raised by his knowing and repeated violation of Federal and state drug laws. His \nactions do not reflect the good judgment, reliability, and adherence to laws and regulations \nrequired of one entrusted to safeguard classified information. He did not mitigate the drug \ninvolvement security concerns. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline H:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a.-1.b.: \nAgainst Applicant \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n____________________ \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, I conclude \nthat it is not clearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant Applicant \neligibility for a security clearance.

He is married with no children. He has Dual Master \ndegrees in Mechanical Engineering, and Engineering Technology and Innovation \nManagement. (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit B.) He has taken additional courses relevant to his \nposition and holds several certifications. (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit C.) He holds the position \nof Lead Artificial Intelligence Architect with a defense contractor. He is seeking to \nobtain a security clearance in connection with his employment. \nGuideline H - Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse  \nGuideline E \u2013 Personal Conduct \n \nThe Government alleges that the Applicant has used controlled substances that \ncause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner inconsistent with their \nintended purpose; and that he has engaged in conduct involving questionable judgment, \nwhich can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness. \nApplicant has a history of illegal drug use from about June 2012 until June 2019. \nHe admitted that he has used and purchased marijuana and products containing THC \non various occasions over this seven or eight year period. While in college, during his \nundergraduate studies, he used marijuana about once or twice a month. \nAfter \ngraduating, he began consuming THC on a weekly basis. His weekly pattern of THC \nusage continued throughout graduate school and after graduation. During an internship \nin 2018, Applicant was still using marijuana regularly. (Applicant\u2019s Answer to SOR.) \nIn 2018, Applicant began to seriously consider pursuing a career in the defense \nindustry. Realizing that he would have to qualify for a security clearance, he decided to \nquit using marijuana. He also stopped associating with his drug using friends. In June \n2019, Applicant ingested a THC gummy while visiting his brother in California. \nApplicant used the THC gummy with the thought that he was using it in a state that \nlegalized the use of marijuana for recreational purposes, and he was not violating the \nlaw. Applicant specifically remembers the date of June 2019, as his last use of any \nillegal drug because at this time of use he was spending time with his brother in \nCalifornia. Applicant submitted a photograph of he and his brother on this occasion. \n(Applicant\u2019s Exhibit G.) \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n    \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant began working for defense contractor A in June 2019. He applied for \nand obtained his first security clearance about the same time. Applicant contends that \nsince being hired by defense contractor A, and being granted a security clearance, he \nhas completely abstained from all illegal drug use and has no intentions of ever \nreturning to it. (Applicant\u2019s Answer to SOR.) \nApplicant also admitted that he used cocaine on two separate occasions \nbetween 2016 and 2018. \nHe states that he used cocaine once in the spring of 2016, \nwith some upperclassmen at his university. He also used it once at the beginning of \n2018, while at a New Year\u2019s Eve party. He stated that he has no intentions of ever \nusing cocaine again. (Applicant\u2019s Answer to SOR.) \nApplicant completed a security clearance application dated July 31, 2019. \n(Government Exhibit 2.) In response to questions in Section 23, concerning Illegal Use \nof Drugs or Drug Activity, Illegal Use of Drugs or Controlled Substances, he was asked, \n\u201cIn the last seven years have you illegally used any drugs or controlled substances?\u201d \nApplicant answered, \u201cYes\u201d, but failed to disclose the information set forth above, \nspecifically his full use of marijuana as well as his cocaine use. Applicant subsequently \nunderwent a polygraph examination and divulged all of his prior drug use. (Applicant\u2019s \nAnswer to SOR.) \nOn March 24, 2021, Applicant completed another security clearance application. \n(Government Exhibit 1.) In response to the same questions in his previous application \nin Section 23, concerning Illegal Use of Drugs or Drug Activity, Illegal Use of Drugs or \nControlled Substances, he was again asked, \u201cIn the last seven years, have you illegally \nused any drugs or controlled substances?\u201d Applicant answered, \u201cYes,\u201d but failed to \ndisclose the information set forth above, specifically his full use of marijuana as well as \nhis cocaine use. Again, he failed to disclose his full use of marijuana as well as his \ncocaine use. \nApplicant denied that he deliberately attempted to conceal his illegal drug use on \nhis security clearance applications. He stated that he was attempting to update his e-\nQIP with the information he provided during a polygraph examination when he put down \nthe wrong date that he last used an illegal drug. He stated that he made an error and \naccidentally listed that July 2020, was his last use of an illegal drug when in actuality, \nhis last use of any illegal drug was in June 2019. He stated that he now realizes that his \nrush through the e-QIP was not wise, as he did not check or double check his answers \nbefore submitting them. (Applicant\u2019s Answer to SOR) \nApplicant also stated that in 2021, when he completed his second security \nclearance application for a clearance upgrade, he thought the investigators would use \nthe previous information from his 2019 security clearance investigation to supplement \nthe current investigation. He later found his assumption to be wrong. Applicant now \nrealizes that each time he completes the application or is interviewed for any purpose \nduring his security clearance investigation, he must give full and complete answers, and \nnot just a \u201cYes\u201d or \u201cNo\u201d answer, if the question requires more. He now knows that he \nshould have disclosed all relevant information in response to all questions on his e-QIP \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n   \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \nand be as detailed as possible. Applicant contends that he did not deliberately attempt \nto hide any material information from the Government in response to questions on either \nof his security clearance applications. (Applicant\u2019s Answer to SOR) \nApplicant has submitted a signed Statement of Intent to abstain from all illegal \ndrug involvement and substance misuse. \n(Applicant\u2019s Exhibit F.) \nHe has also \nundergone a voluntary drug test to show his continued commitment to a drug free \nlifestyle. \n(Applicant\u2019s Exhibit I.) \nApplicant deeply regrets his past behavior and \nacknowledges that his past illegal drug use was an error in judgment that will not be \nrepeated. (Applicant\u2019s Answer to SOR.) \nIn January 2023, Applicant was hired by his current employer as a Lead Data \nScientist. Since then, based upon his strong work ethic and excellent performance, he \nhas been promoted twice. His most recent performance evaluation from his supervisor \ndated August 22, 2023, reflects that Applicant has exceeded all expectation of his \nposition. He is effective, providing technical expertise, and helping the team stay on \ntrack to meet critical milestones. Overall he has made a significant impact in his short \ntime at the firm. (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit D.) \nApplicant\u2019s Manager nominated Applicant for the \u201cBlack Engineer of the Year \nAward\u201d representing the entire company. (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit E.) \nApplicant\u2019s wife, a medical student, testified that she has been married to the \nApplicant since June 8, 2023. She and her husband do not use illegal drugs of any sort \nand never have. Furthermore, they do not associate with anyone who uses illegal \ndrugs. She describes her husband as very ambitious, passionate about his career, and \nsobriety is naturally a part of their lifestyle. She stated that he is remorseful for not \nbeing as thorough as he could have been when he filled out the security clearance \napplications. (Tr. pp. 29-32.) \nApplicant\u2019s brother testified that he gave the Applicant the THC gummy that he \ningested in June 2019. Applicant was visiting his brother in the state at the time. This \nwas the same month he either started or was interviewed for the job with defense \ncontractor A. (Tr. pp. 40, and 44-46.) \nLetters of recommendation from professional associates, including former \nsupervisors, and from family members, including his brother, mother, and wife, \ncollectively attest to Applicant\u2019s overall outstanding character. He is known for his \ntrustworthiness, integrity, honesty, transparency, and supportive nature. He is also \ndescribed as being responsible, loyal, and helpful. He is said to be a natural leader with \nexcellent technical skills, who is ambitious, well liked, and respected by those who know \nhim.

In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. The entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of \nvariables known as the whole-person concept. The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance \ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to \npotential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAnalysis \nGuideline H - Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Drug Involvement and \nSubstance Misuse is set forth at AG \u00b6 24: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual's reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior \nmay lead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. Controlled substance means any \"controlled substance\" \nas defined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term \nadopted in this guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above. \nThe guideline at AG \u00b6 25 contains three conditions that could raise a security \nconcern and may be disqualifying: \n(a) any substance misuse (see above definition);   \n(c) illegal possession of a controlled substance, including cultivation, \nprocessing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of \ndrug paraphernalia; and  \n(f) any illegal drug use while granted access to classified information or \nholding a sensitive position. \nApplicant used and purchased marijuana and products containing THC with \nvarying frequency from about June 2011 until June 2019. He has also used cocaine on \ntwo occasions in 2015, and December 2018. The evidence is sufficient to raise the \nabove disqualifying conditions. \nThe guideline at AG \u00b6 26 contains conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns. Two are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \nand \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this \nproblem, and has established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not \nlimited to: \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n         \n \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n     \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts;  \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were \nused; and  \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all \ndrug involvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that \nany future involvement or misuse is grounds for revocation \nof national security eligibility. \nApplicant used marijuana and cocaine over a seven or eight-year period, mainly \nwhile in college, from 2011 to about 2019. Applicant quit using illegal drugs altogether \nin June 2019, and has been drug free for the past four years, which he intends to \ncontinue. Applicant understands the consequences if he uses or has any Illegal drug \ninvolvement. He has signed a statement of intent which indicates that he must abstain \nfrom any drug involvement or substance misuse or his security clearance will be \nimmediately revoked. His misconduct of the past is mitigated. \nGuideline E- Personal Conduct \nThe security concern for Personal Conduct is set out in AG \u00b6 15: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information.  Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 16. Three are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or \nsimilar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment \nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine national security \neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities;  \n(b) deliberately providing false or misleading information; or concealing \ninvestigator, security official, competent medical or mental health \nprofessional involved in making a recommendation relevant to a national \nsecurity \neligibility \ndetermination, \nor \nother \nofficial \ngovernment \nrepresentative; and  \n(d) credible adverse information that is not explicitly covered under any \nother guideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an adverse \ndetermination, but which, when combined with all available information, \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \nsupports \na \nwhile-person \nassessment \nof \nquestionable \njudgment, \nuntrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply \nwith rules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that the \nindividual may not properly safeguard classified or sensitive information. \nThis includes, but is not limited to, consideration of; \n(2) any disruptive, violent or other inappropriate behavior; and \n(3) a pattern of dishonesty or rule violations. \nApplicant failed to provide thorough and complete information concerning his \nillegal drug use in response to questions on his security clearance applications dated \nJuly 31, 2019, and March 24, 2021. The evidence is sufficient to raise the above \ndisqualifying conditions. \nThe guideline at AG \u00b6 17 contains conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns. One of the conditions is potentially applicable: \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, \nunreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely \nto recur.   \nFrom 2011 to 2019, Applicant used marijuana and products containing THC on \nvarious occasions over a period of eight years. He also used cocaine on two occasions \nin 2015 and in December 2018. He admitted to his illegal drug use on his security \nclearance applications, but failed to give a full and complete history of his drug use. \nFor example, he failed to list his cocaine use on his July 2019 security clearance \napplication, as he stated he forgot about it because he used it so minimally. Although \nhe did reveal it during his polygraph examination, he should have amended his 2019 \napplication to be most accurate. Applicant should also have reported any illegal drug \nuse to his security department. In fact, any security violation he commits, he must \nreport to his security department. He did not report his illegal drug use to his security \ndepartment in June 2019, when he should have. On the surface, it appears that he was \nattempting to conceal the true extent of his illegal drug history. \nIt is noted that Applicant is a fairly young man, with little defense industry \nexperience. He is highly educated, a company standout with remarkable potential, and \nnow a member of the defense contracting industry. He was not as familiar with the \nsecurity rules and regulations as he should have been. He admits his wrong doing and \nis extremely remorseful. Since then, he has made drastic changes to improve his life, \nand to meet the eligibility requirements to access classified information. There is no \nroom for error now. He has quit using any illegal drugs and no longer associates with \ndrug users. He also understands what is required of him and how to properly complete \nhis security clearance applications. As he noted, in the future, he will hire counsel if he \nneeds to. \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n     \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \nThere is still some question as to whether he used the THC gummy before or \nafter he was hired or interviewed for employment by defense contractor A. In either \ncase, he was wrong for using it. He knew or should have known that its use was in \nviolation of security policies. He now understands the security rules and regulations \nthat he is expected to follow, and his mistakes of the past are highly unlikely to recur. \nHe understands the consequences of his actions and the importance of protecting \nclassified information. Illegal drug use is also against Federal law. It is against DoD \npolicies, rules, and regulations, and is not tolerated under any circumstances by a \ndefense contractor. \nApplicant now clearly understands that illegal drug use is \nprohibited in any form while holding a security clearance or while in a sensitive position. \nHe also understands that he must be honest and truthful throughout the entire security \nclearance investigation process and be extremely thorough. He must do everything to \navoid any mistakes or errors. He knows that he is held to a high standard and he must \nconsistently demonstrate this understanding. \nConsidered in totality, Applicant\u2019s conduct supports a finding of good judgment, \nreliability, and/or the ability to abide by rules and regulations. To be entrusted with the \nprivilege of holding a security clearance, applicants are expected to abide by all laws, \nregulations and policies that apply to them. Under the particular facts of this case, \nApplicant shows the requisite character or judgment of someone who has the maturity, \nintegrity, and reliability necessary to access classified information. Applicant meets the \neligibility qualifications for a security clearance. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuidelines H and E in my whole-person analysis. An individual who holds a security \nclearance is expected to comply with the law at all times. Applicant has demonstrated \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n          \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                            \n \n \n \n \n \n \nthe level of maturity needed for access to classified information. Applicant understands \nthe requirements associated with holding a security clearance and knows that illegal \ndrug use is not tolerated. Applicant is an individual in whom the Government can be \nconfident to know that he will always follow rules and regulations and do the right thing, \neven when no one is looking. Applicant does meet the qualifications for a security \nclearance. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions and doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant has mitigated the Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse, and \nPersonal Conduct security concerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline H: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a through 1.c \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 2.a and 2.b \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for \na security clearance.

On June \n26, 2023, the Defense Counterintelligence and Security Agency Consolidated \nAdjudication Services (CAS) sent her a Statement of Reasons (SOR) alleging security \nconcerns under Guidelines B and C. The CAS acted under Executive Order (Exec.

On \nSeptember 27, 2023, Applicant requested an expedited hearing. The case was assigned \nto me on October 3, 2023. On October 17, 2023, the Defense Office of Hearings and \nAppeals (DOHA) notified Applicant that the hearing was scheduled to be conducted by \nvideo teleconference on October 23, 2023. Applicant waived the 15-day notice \nrequirement in the Directive, and I convened the hearing as scheduled. Government \nExhibits (GX) 1 and 2 were admitted in evidence without objection. Applicant testified but \ndid not present the testimony of any other witnesses or submit any additional \ndocumentary evidence. After the hearing adjourned, she submitted a PowerPoint \npresentation summarizing her testimony. It is included in the record as Applicant\u2019s Exhibit \nA. DOHA received the transcript (Tr.) on November 1, 2023.  \nAmendment of SOR \nDepartment Counsel amended paragraph 1 of the SOR, which was intended to \nallege concerns under Guideline B. However, paragraph 1 of the SOR erroneously set \nout the security concern for Guideline C instead of the security concern for Guideline B. \nParagraph 2 of the SOR correctly recited the security concern under Guideline C. The \nproposed amendment corrected the error in SOR \u00b6 1. I recessed the hearing to ensure \nthat Applicant understood the meaning of the amendment and had sufficient time to \nrespond to it. After conferring with Department Counsel, she did not object to the \namendment and did not request additional time to respond to it. (Tr. 5-7) In addition to the \namendment of the SOR by Department Counsel, I have sua sponte corrected the spelling \nof Colombia, which is misspelled \u201cColumbia\u201d in the SOR. \nAdministrative Notice \nDepartment Counsel requested that I take administrative notice of relevant facts \nabout Colombia. The request and supporting documents are attached to the record as \nGX 2. I took administrative notice as requested by Department Counsel. The facts \nadministratively noticed are set out below in my findings of fact. \nFindings of Fact \nIn Applicant\u2019s answer to the SOR, she admitted the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.g. \nHer admissions are incorporated in my findings of fact. \nApplicant is a 28-year-old systems analyst employed by a defense contractor since \nAugust 2022. She was born in Colombia, entered the United States in August 2012, and \nbecame a U.S. citizen in March 2018.

Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 2. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge \napplies these guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec.

The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 15-01253 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2016). \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts.

It is established. \nSOR \u00b6 1.b alleges that Applicant\u2019s grandmother is a citizen and resident of \nColombia. This allegation is not fully established, because her grandmother is a dual U.S.-\nColombian citizen and a resident of the United States.  \nSOR \u00b6 1.c alleges that Applicant\u2019s aunts and cousins are citizens and residents of \nColombia. This allegation is not fully established, because her maternal aunts and \ncousins are dual U.S.-Colombian citizens. \nSOR \u00b6 1.d alleges that Applicant provides monthly financial support of about $340 \nto her mother, a citizen and resident of Colombia. This allegation is established. \nSOR \u00b6 1.e alleges that Applicant provides monthly financial support of about $200 \nto her grandmother, a citizen and resident of Colombia. This allegation is not established. \nHer grandmother is a dual U.S.-Colombian citizen and a resident of the United States. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nShe does not give her grandmother monthly financial support. She gives her grandmother \noccasional gifts on special occasions. \nThe security concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 6: \nForeign contacts and interests, including, but not limited to, business, \nfinancial, and property interests, are a national security concern if they result \nin divided allegiance. They may also be a national security concern if they \ncreate circumstances in which the individual maybe manipulated or induced \nto help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a way \ninconsistent with U.S. interests or otherwise made vulnerable to pressure \nor coercion by any foreign interest. Assessment of foreign contacts and \ninterests should consider the country in which the foreign contact or interest \nis located, including, but not limited to, considerations such as whether it is \nknown to target U.S. citizens to obtain classified or sensitive information or \nis associated with a risk of terrorism. \nThe following disqualifying conditions are potentially applicable: \nAG \u00b6 7(a): contact, regardless of method, with a foreign family member, \nbusiness or professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen \nof or resident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk \nof foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; \nand \nAG \u00b6 7(b): connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country \nthat create a potential conflict of interest between the individual's obligation \nto protect classified or sensitive information or technology and the \nindividual's desire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing \nthat information or technology. \nGuideline B is not limited to countries hostile to the United States. \u201cThe United \nStates has a compelling interest in protecting and safeguarding classified information \nfrom any person, organization, or country that is not authorized to have access to it, \nregardless of whether that person, organization, or country has interests inimical to those \nof the United States.\u201d ISCR Case No. 02-11570 at 5 (App. Bd. May 19, 2004). \nFurthermore, \u201ceven friendly nations can have profound disagreements with the \nUnited States over matters they view as important to their vital interests or national \nsecurity.\u201d ISCR Case No. 00-0317 (App. Bd. Mar. 29, 2002). Finally, we know friendly \nnations have engaged in espionage against the United States, especially in the economic, \nscientific, and technical fields. Nevertheless, the nature of a nation\u2019s government, its \nrelationship with the United States, and its human-rights record are relevant in assessing \nthe likelihood that an applicant\u2019s family members are vulnerable to government coercion. \nThe risk of coercion, persuasion, or duress is significantly greater if the foreign country \nhas an authoritarian government, a family member is associated with or dependent upon \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nthe government, or the country is known to conduct intelligence operations against the \nUnited States. In considering the nature of the government, an administrative judge must \nalso consider any terrorist activity in the country at issue. See ISCR Case No. 02-26130 \nat 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 7, 2006). \nAG \u00b6 7(a) requires substantial evidence of a \u201cheightened risk.\u201d The \u201cheightened \nrisk\u201d required to raise one of these disqualifying conditions is a relatively low standard. \n\u201cHeightened risk\u201d denotes a risk greater than the normal risk inherent in having a family \nmember living under a foreign government. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 12-05839 at 4 (App. \nBd. Jul. 11, 2013). \u201cHeightened risk\u201d is not a high standard. See, e.g., ISCR Case No.17-\n03026 at 5 (App. Bd. Jan. 16, 2019). It is a level of risk one step above a State Department \nLevel 1 travel advisory (\u201cexercise normal precaution\u201d) and equivalent to the Level 2 \nadvisory (\u201cexercise increased caution\u201d) When family ties are involved, the totality of an \napplicant\u2019s family ties to a foreign country as well as each individual family tie must be \nconsidered. ISCR Case No. 01-22693 at 7 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2003). The State \nDepartment\u2019s Level 3 travel advisory for Colombia, (based on crime, terrorism; civil \nunrest, and kidnapping), and the Level 4 travel advisory (based on crime and kidnapping) \nfor the region where Applicant\u2019s parents live are sufficient to establish the heightened risk \nunder AG \u00b6 7(a) and a potential conflict of interest under AG \u00b6 7(b).  \nThe following mitigating conditions are potentially applicable: \nAG \u00b6 8(a): the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country \nin which these persons are located, or the positions or activities of those \npersons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be placed \nin a position of having to choose between the interests of a foreign \nindividual, group, organization, or government and the interests of the \nUnited States; and \nAG \u00b6 8(b): there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s \nsense of loyalty or obligation to the foreign person, or allegiance to the \ngroup, government, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such deep \nand longstanding relationships and loyalties in the United States, that the \nindividual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the \nU.S. interest. \nAG \u00b6 8(a) is not established. Applicant has close ties to her parents, who live in a \ncountry rife with violence and lawlessness. She is cautious when she visits her parents in \nColombia, because she knows the risks of violent crime and kidnapping. \nAG \u00b6 8(b) is established. Applicant entered the United States 11 years ago, was \neducated in the United States, lives with an aunt who is a U.S. citizen. All her paternal \naunts and cousins are dual U.S.-Colombian citizens and live in the United States. \nApplicant aspires to continue her education and advance her professional career in the \nUnited States. While she has a cultural attachment to the country of her birth, she clearly \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nhas no affection for the political climate, corrupt government, and lawless living conditions \nin Colombia. She is willing to renounce her Colombian citizenship if necessary. \nGuideline C, Foreign Preference \nThe SOR \u00b6 2.a alleges that Applicant used her Colombian passport to exit and \nenter the United States after becoming a U.S. citizen. This allegation is not established. \nApplicant traveled with her U.S. and Colombian passports and used her U.S. passport to \nenter and exit the United States and her Colombian passport to enter and exit Colombia. \nSOR \u00b6 2.a alleges that Applicant voted in a Colombian presidential election after \nbecoming a U.S. citizen. This allegation is established. \nThe security concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 9: \nWhen an individual acts in such a way as to indicate a preference for a \nforeign country over the United States, then he or she may provide \ninformation or make decisions that are harmful to the interests of the United \nStates. Foreign involvement raises concerns about an individual's \njudgment, reliability, and trustworthiness when it is in conflict with U.S. \nnational interests or when the individual acts to conceal it. By itself; the fact \nthat a U.S. citizen is also a citizen of another country is not disqualifying \nwithout an objective showing of such conflict or attempt at concealment. \nThe same is true for a U.S. citizen's exercise of any right or privilege of \nforeign citizenship and any action to acquire or obtain recognition of a \nforeign citizenship. \nThe security concern under this guideline is not limited to countries hostile to the \nU.S. \u201cUnder the facts of a given case, an applicant\u2019s preference, explicit or implied, even \nfor a nation with which the U.S. has enjoyed long and peaceful relations, might pose a \nchallenge to U.S. interests.\u201d ADP Case No. 07-14939 at 4 (App. Bd. Mar. 11, 2009). \nDual citizenship standing alone is not sufficient to warrant an adverse security \nclearance decision. ISCR Case No. 99-0454 at 5 (App. Bd. Oct. 17, 2000). Under \nGuideline C, \u201cthe issue is not whether an applicant is a dual national, but rather whether \nan applicant shows a preference for a foreign country through actions.\u201d  ISCR Case No. \n98-0252 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 15, 1999). \nThe following disqualifying conditions under this guideline are potentially relevant: \nAG \u00b6 11(a): applying for and/or acquiring citizenship in any other country; \nAG \u00b6 11(b): failure to use a U.S. passport when entering or exiting the U.S.; \nand \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 11(d): participation in foreign activities, including but not limited to . . . \notherwise acting to serve the interests of a foreign person, group, \norganization, or government in any way that conflicts with U.S. national \nsecurity interests. \nNone of the above conditions are established. Applicant is a native-born citizen of \nColombia. She has not sought citizenship in any country other than the United States. \nAlthough she holds passports from the United States and Colombia, she used her U.S. \npassport when entering and leaving the United States. Department Counsel submitted no \nevidence showing that Applicant\u2019s one-time voting in an election in Colombia conflicted \nwith U.S. national security interests. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-\nperson concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process \nfactors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nI have incorporated my comments under Guideline B and C in my whole-person \nanalysis and applied the adjudicative factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). Applicant was candid, sincere, \nand credible at the hearing. She spoke enthusiastically about her career aspirations in \nthe United States. She has no desire to live in Colombia. After weighing the disqualifying \nand mitigating conditions under Guidelines B and C, and evaluating all the evidence in \nthe context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has mitigated the security concerns \nraised by her family connections in Colombia and her participation in one Colombian \npresidential election. \nFormal Findings \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \nParagraph 1, Guideline B, Foreign Influence: \nFOR APPLICANT \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.e: \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline C, Foreign Preference: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 2.a and 2.b: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nI conclude that it is clearly consistent with the national security interests of the \nUnited States to grant Applicant eligibility for access to classified information.

DOHA received the transcript of the \nhearing (Tr.) on November 17, 2023. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant is 35 years old. He is unmarried with two children. He has a high \nschool diploma. He is employed with a defense contractor as a Security Professional. \nHe is applying for a security clearance in connection with his employment. Applicant \nbegan working for his current employer in August 2022. \nGuideline F - Financial Considerations \nThe Government alleged that Applicant is ineligible for a clearance because he \nmade financial decisions that indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which raise questions about his \nreliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified information. \nThe SOR identified one delinquent debt owed to a bank that was charged off in \nthe amount of $19,427. Applicant admits the allegation. Credit Reports of Applicant \ndated October 22, 2022; July 20, 2023; and October 2, 2023, confirm the indebtedness \nlisted in the SOR. (Government Exhibits 3, 4, and 5.) \nApplicant stated that he incurred the debt when he financed a new vehicle in \nNovember 2017. He defaulted on the loan in about April 2018. The debt remains owing. \nBesides this debt, Applicant has no history of financial indebtedness. \nThe \ncircumstances as to how Applicant incurred this debt are as follows: \nIn 2017, Applicant was close to finishing the lease period on a Dodge Charger \nand had taken it into the dealership for the sole purpose of being serviced. At that time, \nApplicant had no intentions of purchasing a car. A few months earlier he had become a \nfather, and he thought that it might be nice to get a new and larger vehicle to better \naccommodate his new child, but it was just a thought. On this day, his impulses took \nover. \nSince he was gainfully employed, and had maintained good credit, he was \nencouraged by the salesman to test drive several vehicles. After doing so, he was \nconvinced that he should purchase a new car. Not long thereafter, he was approved for \na new car loan. With no intention of buying a car, he found himself financing a brand \nnew 2018 Dodge Charger. The vehicle cost him a total of approximately $40,724. The \nmonthly payments were about $612. At that time, Applicant was making $12.00 per \nhour, and working 40 hours a week. Two days later, when reality sank in, after talking \nwith family and friends about the purchase, and after realizing that he should not have \npurchased such an expensive vehicle, he contacted the dealership and asked if he \ncould return it. They told him that state law did not have a \u201ccooling off\u201d period and that \nhe was stuck with the vehicle. They further explained that if he did not make a payment \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n             \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \non the car, they would repossess it from him. About a month later, Appellant failed to \nmake the payment, and just as the dealer said, they repossessed the car. When the \nvehicle was repossessed it had been driven less than 1,000 miles. The dealer told the \nApplicant that after the vehicle was sold, he would be responsible for the deficiency \nowed on the loan. The amount owed by the Applicant to the bank after the sale of the \nvehicle is $19,427. \nApplicant stated that in August 2021, he was notified by the creditor or their \nrepresentative that he needed to respond to a Court Summons concerning the debt \nowed to the bank. Applicant remembers responding to the Summons on-line sometime \nin 2021. He stated that since then he has heard nothing further. \nApplicant testified that the decision to purchase the car in the first place was a \nmisjudgment on his part.  He could not afford to keep up with the payments.  To this \nday, Applicant has not made any payments toward resolving the debt.  He stated that \nhe does not have the money to do so.  In an attempt to give Applicant the benefit of the \ndoubt, with the exception of this delinquent debt, considering the Applicant\u2019s otherwise \ngood financial history, the record was left open to allow Applicant the opportunity to \nlearn more about the debt, and to determine what if anything he chose to do about it.  \nApplicant did contact the law firm that is handling the debt collection.  They have \nprovided him with a 45-day offer for a full and final settlement of the account in the \namount of $15,542.04.  (Applicant\u2019s Post-Hearing Exhibit A.)  Applicant provided no \nfurther information.     \nA letter of recommendation from the defense contractor\u2019s Security Site Focal, \nwho works closely with Applicant, indicates that Applicant is dependable, professional, \nand trustworthy. He is honest and transparent and displays high ethical principles. \nRegardless of the challenges or tight deadlines that may arise, Applicant can always be \ncounted on to deliver high quality results. He is considered to be a true gem, with the \nhighest level of integrity, who always meets or exceeds his job expectations. \nApplicant\u2019s skills and capabilities, as well as his character and dedication to the job are \ndescribed as exemplary. His attention to detail and his commitment to continuous \nimprovement are evident in every task he undertakes.  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit A.) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ncommonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious \nscrutiny of a number of variables known as the whole-person concept. The \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d \nA person who applies for access to classified information seeks to enter into a \nfiduciary relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n \n \n \n    \n \n \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. Three are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; \n(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant remains excessively indebted to the one creditor listed in the SOR. \nOther than contacting the law firm in charge of the debt collection and providing a copy \nof their settlement offer, Applicant has done nothing to show that he is or has been \nworking to resolve the debt. He has made no payments toward resolving it. The \nevidence is sufficient to raise the above disqualifying conditions. \nAG \u00b6 20 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. I considered \nall of the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 including: \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; and \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nApplicant has provided no evidence in mitigation to show that he is doing \nanything to resolve the debt. Under the particular circumstances here, Applicant has \nfailed to establish that he has acted reasonably or responsibly with respect to his \ndelinquent debt. As it stands, Applicant has done nothing to resolve his debt. In fact, \nhe has not even made one payment. Even with the record left open for several weeks \nfollowing the hearing to allow him the opportunity to contact the creditor and address the \ndebt in some fashion, he did nothing more than to show that he was offered a \nsettlement. He did not indicate whether he accepted the settlement or whether he \nrejected it. In any event, he has not demonstrated that his financial problems have \nbeen addressed or are under control, and that future financial problems are unlikely. \nNone of the mitigating conditions are applicable. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n          \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline F in my whole-person analysis. Applicant failed to provide any evidence to \nshow that he is or has been making payments toward resolving his excessive \ndelinquent debt. \nThus, Applicant has not demonstrated that he is financially \nresponsible. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant failed to mitigate the Financial Considerations security concerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 1.a  \nAgainst Applicant \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant national security eligibility \nfor a security clearance.

Karoian, Esq., Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro se \n11/04/2024 \nDecision \nOn September 29, 2022, the Department of Defense (DOD) issued a Statement \nof Reasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing security concerns under Guideline B, foreign \ninfluence. The action was taken under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines implemented by DOD on \nJune 8, 2017 (AG). \nOn October 28, 2022, Applicant provided a response to the SOR, and requested \na hearing before an administrative judge. The case was assigned to another \nadministrative judge on February 17, 2023. A hearing was scheduled and held on April \n13, 2023. I was assigned to the case on October 16, 2024. I contacted Applicant \noffering to reopen his case for a supplemental hearing since so much time had passed. \nHe declined the offer to have a supplementary hearing, but instead provided additional \ndocumentary evidence, which I admitted without objection. After completely reviewing \nthe record from the first hearing and considering all the hearing and post-hearing \nexhibits, I informed the parties that I believed this case was appropriate for a Summary \nDisposition in Applicant\u2019s favor. Department Counsel did not object.  \nThis case involves seven allegations of foreign influence concerns under \nGuideline B. I believe a Summary Disposition is appropriate because Applicant testified \n1 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nand presented documentary evidence establishing there is no conflict of interest with his \nfamily members in Kyrgyzstan because of his deep and long-standing relationship and \nloyalties to the United States, as evidenced by his service in the Army National Guard, \nhis community ties through his job and his children's schooling, and his financial ties to \nthe United States. Additionally, his family contact is minimal, the greatest part of which \nis to communicate with his aged parents about their health status. He cut off contact \nwith one former colleague in Kyrgyzstan in 2018 and the second former colleague now \nresides in the U.S. as a green card holder. His current supervisor and a colleague \ntestified that Applicant is \"forthright and forthcoming\" and that he is trustworthy and \nreliable in performing his duties as a security clearance background investigator. \nThe concerns over Applicant\u2019s foreign influence no longer create doubts about \nhis current reliability, trustworthiness, good judgment, and ability to protect classified \ninformation. He established his deep and longstanding relationships and loyalties in the \nUnited States, such that he can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of \nthe U.S. interest. In reaching these conclusions, I weighed the evidence as a whole and \nconsidered if the favorable evidence outweighed the unfavorable evidence. I also gave \ndue consideration to the whole-person concept. Accordingly, I conclude that he met his \nultimate burden of persuasion to show that it is clearly consistent with the national \ninterest to grant his eligibility for access to classified information. This case is decided \nfor Applicant. Clearance is granted. \nRobert E. Coacher \nAdministrative Judge \n2 \n",

Eligibility for a security clearance is granted. \nStatement of the Case \nOn April 19, 2019 Applicant applied for a security clearance and submitted a \nQuestionnaire for National Security Positions (SF 86). On February 28, 2020, the Defense \nCounterintelligence and Security Agency (DCSA) Consolidated Adjudications Facility \n(CAF) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to him, under Executive Order (Exec.

The SOR \nrecommended referral to an administrative judge to determine whether a clearance \nshould be granted, continued, denied, or revoked. \nIn a notarized statement, dated April 3, 2020, Applicant responded to the SOR and \nrequested a hearing before an administrative judge. Department Counsel indicated the \nGovernment was prepared to proceed on October 29, 2020. Because of health concerns \nassociated with the COVID-19 pandemic and pandemic protocols, the case was not \nassigned to me until October 25, 2021. A Notice of Hearing was issued on January 24, \n2022. I convened the hearing as scheduled on February 10, 2022. \nDuring the hearing, Government exhibits (GE) 1 through GE 3, and Applicant \nexhibits (AE) A through AE E were admitted into evidence without objection. Applicant \ntestified. The transcript (Tr.) was received on February 18, 2022. I kept the record open \nto enable Applicant to supplement it with documentation that was identified during the \nhearing. He took advantage of that opportunity and timely submitted two documents \nwhich were marked and admitted as AE F and AE G without objection. The record closed \non March 10. 2022. \nOn March 22, 2022, after having considered all of the evidence, I issued a decision \nin the case that it was clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant \neligibility for a security clearance. Accordingly, his access to classified information was \ngranted. Department Counsel subsequently appealed that decision. \nOn June 12, 2022, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) Appeal \nBoard issued a decision, remanding the case for the following reason: \nAn examination of the record reveals that it may not be complete. In his \nbrief, Department Counsel noted the Judge requested at the hearing that \nApplicant provide a complete copy of the records of the treatment he \nreceived from a psychologist. Appeal Brief at 6, quoting from Tr. at 45. \nDepartment Counsel also argued that \u201cApplicant produced none of the \nadditional material. Instead, he provided [a record from his primary care \nphysician] showing ongoing treatment for depression.\u201d Id. In his reply brief, \nApplicant argues that statement is false, claiming he submitted in a timely \nmanner 30 additional \u201cdocuments\u201d from the psychologist, including \u201cevery \nrecord he held [,] as well as records from his primary care physician. Reply \nBrief at 2. In the decision, the Judge noted he received two post-hearing \ndocuments from Applicant that were marked as Applicant\u2019s Exhibits F (a \nthree-page final report from the primary care physician) and G (a one-page \nOrder of Termination of Probation from a county court). \nBased on the foregoing, we conclude the best resolution is to remand this \ncase for the Judge to determine whether the record is complete. On \nremand, the Judge is required to issue a new decision.

Upon being \nnotified that additional documents had apparently been submitted, I performed a \ncomputer search, but that effort failed to locate them. It is possible that they were sent to \nmy old, and no-longer working, email address. An email was received from Applicant, \ndated July 7, 2022, which contained Chart Notes, Diagnosis and Treatment Plan; \nProgress Notes; and SOAP Notes (Subjective, Objective, Assessment, and Plan). In the \nabsence of objection from Department Counsel, I have marked those documents and \nadmitted them as AE H. \nFindings of Fact \nIn his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted, with comments, all of the factual \nallegations in the SOR (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a. and 1.b., 2.a., and 3.a.). His admissions and \ncomments are incorporated herein. After a complete and thorough review of the evidence \nin the record, and upon due consideration of same, I make the following findings of fact: \nApplicant is a 34-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has been serving\nas a software development lead with his current employer since October 2021. He \npreviously served as a software developer (April 2019 \u2013 October 2021); software \ndevelopment lead (October 2018 \u2013 April 2019) and application developer (February 2011 \n\u2013 July 2018). He did not indicate when he graduated from high school, but he did receive \na bachelor\u2019s degree in 2010, and earned additional college credits towards a master\u2019s \ndegree, but has not completed the requirements for such a degree. He has never served \nwith the U.S. military. He has never held a security clearance. He was married in 2020. \nHe has one child, born in 2021.  \n \nSexual Behavior, Personal Conduct, and Criminal Conduct \nIn his SF 86, in response to inquiries regarding his police record, Applicant \nreported an incident that occurred in July 2018: \nI regrettably exposed my genitalia to someone that could visible see me \nthrough a window. The following morning there was a news story about the \nincident. I immediately called the police department and let them know I was \nthe person of interest in the news story. I gave them all my information and \nmet with a detective. I didn\u2019t hear anything from them until the end of the \nyear (November 2018). I received a notice for an appearance for the \nincident. We are still in the process of negotiating a plea with the district \nattorney. I believe we are close to negotiating a withhold of adjudication as \nthe witnesses are not interested in pursuing anything against me. As a result \nof my actions, I lost my position [with my employer]. I lost many friends. I \nlost the trust of my family. It was a disgraceful act that does not show my \ntrue character. By my own choice I have been seeing a therapist biweekly \nsince the incident happened (July of 2018). I\u2019ve seen my father cry two \ntimes, once when my grandmother passed and once the day of this news \n3 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nstory. I am confident this issue will not happen ever again. I am very aware \nthat this has the possibility to disqualify me from receiving clearance but I \nstill want to be 100% transparent with everyone. There is no possibility of \nblackmail related to this because a lot of people I know already have heard \nthis story. I have accepted my past and am trying to better myself with a \nbright future. \n(GE 1 at 40) \nOn May 15, 2019, Applicant was interviewed by an investigator with the U.S. Office \nof Personnel Management (OPM). During that interview, he expanded on the incident: \nIn [July 2018] [he] went by himself . . . to the [university]. [He] walked around \non campus and then purposefully exposed his genitals to persons inside of \na food/cafeteria establishment through a window ([he] was standing outside \nflashing the people on the inside). [He] does not remember who he was \nflashing other than it appeared to be women inside of the building. [He] \nexposed himself as he enjoyed doing the act. [He] ran away from the area \nafter he was noticed by people inside the establishment and left the \ncampus. . . . \n(GE 2 at 7 \nAs a result of Applicant\u2019s self-report to the police, in November 2018, a summons \nwas issued charging him with exposure of sexual organ. Throughout the remaining \nportion of 2018 and up through mid-2019, the matter continued until June 5, 2019. On \nthat date, upon his plea of No Contest, the court suspended imposition of sentence and \nplaced him on probation for the term of six months; ordered him to stay away from the \nlocation of the offense; ordered him to have no contact with the victim; and directed him \nto continue counseling. (GE 3; AE D) He successfully completed his probation and it was \nterminated on December 4, 2019. (AE G) \nIn addition to the July 2018 incident, Applicant also reported to the OPM \ninvestigator that three prior similar incidents took place 2015, 2016, and 2017. He was \nnot caught by law enforcement after any of those other incidents. (GE 2 at 8) Upon\nreconsideration, during the hearing, he stated that there were four or five such incidents. \n(Tr. at 26) Although he never targeted certain individuals, he flashed primarily young \nwomen. He never followed them; he never attempted to touch them; he never had \nphysical contact with them; and he never attempted to commit any sex acts with them. \n(Tr. at 26-27) His motive for his actions was merely his own sexual gratification. (Tr. at\n27) The initial incident occurred during a period when Applicant was encountering a \n\u201ccommunication barrier\u201d with his girlfriend before they actually married. She was unaware \nof any of the incidents until he told her following the 2018 incident. (Tr. at 34) \n \n \n \n \nDuring the period of his earlier incidents, he considered seeking professional help, \nbut because of the stigma associated with seeking such help, he did not take any such \nactions. (Tr. at 25) Applicant started addressing his issues regarding his conduct following \n4 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nthe July 2018 incident. He voluntarily engaged the professional services of a licensed \npsychologist that same month, and they initially met for a total of 25 sessions commencing \non July 23, 2018, and continuing at least until August 7, 2019, with their most recent \nsession taking place in February 2022. They initially met weekly, then once each month, \nand then every other month. (Tr. at 30; AE H) At one point, because of the pandemic, no \nin-person sessions were held, but they finally did so in February 2022, when he was \nprescribed antidepressants. (Tr. at 31-33) \nAnother aspect of Applicant\u2019s condition was revealed during therapy. When \nApplicant was in the 7th  grade, he was molested by an 11th  grade high school student who \nwas with a group of friends. The older boy essentially directed him to \u201cshow his privates\u201d, \nand although he did not want to do it, he did so. He never told anyone about the incident, \nbut the incident stayed with him for a substantial time. He finally told someone \u2013 his \npsychologist \u2013 about it. (Tr. at 35; Answer to the SOR at 1)  \n \n \n \n \n \nBased on the information reviewed during therapy, the psychologist\u2019s opinion was: \n[Applicant] was previously diagnosed and treated for Major Depressive \nDisorder and Exhibitionist Disorder. Over the course of treatment, we \ninvestigated the source(s) for the symptoms in question and worked to \neliminate the problematic behaviors, especially the exhibitionistic behaviors. \nIt is my opinion that the Exhibitionistic Disorder is in full remission at this \ntime, as he \u201chas not acted on the urges with a nonconsenting person, and \nthere has been no distress or impairment in social, occupational or other \nareas of functioning\u201d (DSM-5) since 2018. However, he did report \noccasional mild depressive and anxiety issues, and, accordingly, we have \nagreed to recurring psychotherapy services for the foreseeable future to \nassist with ongoing mental health issues. \n(AE E) \nAs noted above, the psychologist indicated that the Exhibitionist Disorder - 302.4\n(F65.2) was considered to be in full remission. The \u201cin full remission\u201d specifier does not \naddress the continued presence or absence of exhibitionism per se, which may still be \npresent after behaviors and distress have remitted. Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of \nDisorders, 5th  Edition \u2013 Text Revision (DSM-V at 689) Exhibitionistic Disorder (exposing \nthe genitals) is considered one of the Paraphilic Disorders under the DSM-V. (DSM-V at \n685) Exhibitionist Disorder was selected for specific listing and assignment of explicit \ndiagnostic criteria in the DSM for two main reasons: it is relatively common, in relation to \nother paraphilic disorders, and it may entail actions for the individual\u2019s satisfaction that \nare noxious or potentially harmful to others, and classified as criminal offenses. Because \nof the nature of Applicant\u2019s alleged activities, they are considered anomalous activity \npreferences which resemble distorted components of human courtship. They are not \nconsidered anomalous target preferences. The term paraphilia denotes any intense and \npersistent sexual interest other than sexual interest in genital stimulation or preparatory \nfondling with phenotypically normal, physically mature, consenting human partners. \nHowever, in some circumstances, the criteria \u201cintense and persistent\u201d may be difficult to \n \n5 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \napply. In such instances, the term paraphilia may be defined as any sexual interest \ngreater than or equal to normophilic sexual interests. (DSM-V at 685-686, 689-691) \nAlthough the psychologist reported that he had also diagnosed Applicant with \nMajor Depressive Disorder, according to his letter of February 7, 2022 (AE E), h\n is actual \nChart Notes, Diagnosis and Treatment Plan; Progress Notes; and SOAP Notes reflect \nthe diagnosis to be Adjustment Disorder with Mixed Anxiety and Depressed Mood \u2013 \n309.28 (F43.23), a combination of depression and anxiety is predominant. It is unclear \nwhich of the two diagnoses are present for [i]f an individual has symptoms that meet \ncriteria for a major depressive disorder in response to a stressor, the diagnosis of an \nadjustment disorder is not applicable.\u201d (DSM-V at 288)  \nFrom December 2018 until about June 2019, Applicant\u2019s physician prescribed \nEscitalopram (commonly called Lexapro) to treat his major depressive disorder, single \nepisode, unspecified. (AE F) Regardless of the actual disorder, over the early course of \nhis treatment, certain stressors continued to be present: losing his job; losing many \nfriends; increased criticism and scrutiny from his family; and legal issues. Financial strain \nand legal issue-related stress were subsequently added. Eventually, Applicant\u2019s mood, \nanxiety, and impulses were reduced, and good improvement was noted in October 2018 \n(AE H) The situation improved somewhat, flattened at times, and again improved, \ndepending on the legal issues or the employment issues confronting him. There was a \nsignificant improvement in August 2019, when the legal issues were resolved; he became \nengaged to his long-time girlfriend; and his mood and anxiety improved.

(AE A) \nPolicies \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the Executive \nBranch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security emphasizing, \n\u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d (Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. \n518, 528 (1988)). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to control \naccess to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual \nis sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information. The standard that must be \nmet is that, based on all available information, the person\u2019s loyalty, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness are such that granting the person access to classified information is \nclearly consistent with the interests of national security. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines in SEAD 4. In addition to \nbrief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating \nan applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nAn administrative judge need not view the guidelines as inflexible, ironclad rules \nof law. Instead, acknowledging the complexities of human behavior, the administrative \njudge applies these guidelines in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative \nprocess. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. The entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of \nvariables known as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a meaningful decision. The concept recognizes that we should \nview a person by the totality of his or her acts, omissions, motivations and other variables. \nEach case must be adjudged on its own merits, taking into consideration all relevant \ncircumstances, and applying sound judgment, mature thinking, and careful analysis. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours as well. It is \nbecause of this special relationship that the Government must be able to repose a high \ndegree of trust and confidence in those individuals to whom it grants access to classified \ninformation. \nDecisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the applicant \nmay deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified information. Such \ndecisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather \n7 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nthan actual, risk of compromise of sensitive information.  Furthermore, security clearance \ndeterminations should err, if they must, on the side of denials. (Department of the Navy \nv. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988)). In reaching this decision, I have drawn only those \nconclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on the evidence contained in the \nrecord. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere speculation or \nconjecture. \nAnalysis \nAt the outset, I note I had ample opportunity to evaluate the demeanor of Applicant, \nobserve his manner and deportment, appraise the way in which he responded to \nquestions, assess his candor or evasiveness, read his statements, and listen to his \ntestimony. It is my impression that his explanations regarding his psychological conditions \nissues are consistent and have the solid resonance of truth. \nUpon consideration of all the facts in evidence, including those in the DOD CAF \ncase file, those submitted by Applicant, and his testimony, as well as an assessment of \nApplicant\u2019s demeanor and credibility, and after application of all appropriate legal \nprecepts and factors, I conclude the following with respect to the allegations set forth in \nthe SOR: \nGuideline D, Sexual Behavior \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Sexual Behavior is set out in AG \n\u00b612. \nSexual behavior that involves a criminal offense; reflects a lack of judgment \nor discretion; or may subject the individual to undue influence of coercion, \nexploitation, or duress. These issues, together or individually, may raise \nquestions about an individual's judgment, reliability, trustworthiness, and \nability to protect classified or sensitive information. Sexual behavior \nincludes conduct occurring in person or via audio, visual, electronic, or \nwritten transmission. No adverse inference concerning the standards in this \nGuideline may be raised solely on the basis of the sexual orientation of the \nindividual. \nThe guideline notes several conditions under AG \u00b6 13 that could raise security \nconcerns in this case: \n(a) sexual behavior of a criminal nature, whether or not the individual has \nbeen prosecuted; \n(b) a pattern of compulsive, self-destructive, or high-risk sexual behavior \nthat the individual is unable to stop;  \n(c) sexual behavior that causes an individual to be vulnerable to coercion, \nexploitation, or duress; and \n8 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(d) sexual behavior of a public nature or that reflects lack of discretion or \njudgment. \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 13(a), 13(b), 13(c), and 13(d) have been established. Applicant\u2019s \nExhibitionistic Disorder (exposing his genitals) in public on several occasions between \n2015 and 2018 constituted a pattern of compulsive and high-risk behavior of a criminal \nnature that reflected a lack of discretion and opened him up to criminal prosecution. Only \none of those incidents \u2013 the one that occurred in July 2018 \u2013 led to his prosecution, \nessentially because it was reported publically and he turned himself into the authorities. \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions under AG \u00b6 14 that could \nmitigate security concerns arising from his Sexual Behavior: \n(b) the sexual behavior happened so long ago, so infrequently, or under \nsuch unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or judgment; \n(c) the behavior no longer serves as a basis for coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and \n(e) the individual has successfully completed an appropriate program of \ntreatment, or is currently enrolled in one, has demonstrated ongoing and \nconsistent compliance with the treatment plan, and/or has received a \nfavorable prognosis from a qualified mental health professional indicating \nthe behavior is readily controllable with treatment. \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 14(b), 14(c), and 14(e) have been established. The significance of his child\u00ad\nhood incident, the memory of which stayed with him for so long, was not fully explained. \nApplicant\u2019s sexual behavior took place between 2015 and 2018, generally once each \nyear, but there have been no repeated incidents since the one in July 2018. Although he \nflashed primarily young women, he never followed them; he never attempted to touch \nthem; he never had physical contact with them; and he never attempted to commit any \nsex acts with them. His motive for his actions was merely his own sexual gratification. \nThings changed after that most recent incident. He self-reported to the police, his \nemployer, and his family. He sought professional help. \nBecause of his self-reporting, the behavior no longer serves as a basis for \ncoercion, exploitation, or duress. Because he sought professional help, he underwent \ntreatment for the Exhibitionistic Disorder. The psychologist \u2013 a qualified mental health \nprofessional \u2013 indicated that the Exhibitionist Disorder was considered to be in full \nremission. While Applicant recently restarted seeing his psychologist, the focus of the \ncontinuing treatment is his Major Depressive Disorder, an issue that is apparently of little \nsecurity concern to the Government because it was not alleged in the SOR. Moreover, \nthat disorder seems to be controlled by prescribed medication. \n9 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Personal Conduct is set out in \nAG \u00b6 15: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or\nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions\nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect\nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to\ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security\ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. The following will normally result in\nan unfavorable national security eligibility determination, security clearance\naction, or cancellation of further processing for national security eligibility: \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(a) refusal, or failure without reasonable cause, to undergo or \ncooperate with security processing, including but not limited \nto meeting with a security investigator for subject interview, \ncompleting security forms or releases, cooperation with \nmedical \nor \npsychological \nevaluation, \nor \npolygraph \nexamination, if authorized and required; and \n(b) refusal to provide full, frank, and truthful answers to lawful \nquestions of investigators, security officials, or other official \nrepresentatives in connection with a personnel security or \ntrustworthiness determination. \nThe guideline also includes an example of a condition that could raise security \nconcerns under AG \u00b6 16: \n(c) credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is \nnot sufficient for an adverse determination under any other single guideline, \nbut which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-person\nassessment of questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack \nof candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations, or other \ncharacteristics indicating that the individual may not properly safeguard \nclassified or sensitive information. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 16(c) has been established. My discussion related to Applicant\u2019s sexual \nbehavior is adopted herein. Following the July 2018 incident, Applicant informed his \nemployer of what had transpired. He was fired. \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions under AG \u00b6 17 that could \nmitigate security concerns arising from personal conduct. They include: \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \n10 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, \nunreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to \nrecur; and \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate vulnerability \nto exploitation, manipulation, or duress. \nAG \u00b6 17(c), 17(d), and 17(e) apply. By its very nature, the SOR allegation has \nlimited Applicant\u2019s alleged personal conduct to the fact that he was fired by his employer \nbecause of the July 2018 incident. No other issues of personal conduct are alleged. That \nincident and the actual termination both occurred in July 2018 \u2013 over three and one-half \nyears ago. Applicant not only acknowledged the behavior, he self-reported it, to the police, \nhis family, and to his employer. He took immediate steps to address his behavior and \nengaged the professional services of a licensed psychologist. After a significant number \nof treatment sessions, that psychologist\u2019s professional opinion was that the Exhibitionistic \nDisorder \u2013 the actual basis for the sexual behavior and the firing \u2013 is in full remission. \nThus, the stressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to Applicant\u2019s \nuntrustworthy, unreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, have been alleviated. \nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Criminal Conduct is set out in AG \n\u00b6 30: \nCriminal activity creates doubt about a person's judgment, reliability, and\ntrustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person's ability or\nwillingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations. \n \n \nThe guideline notes one condition under AG \u00b6 31 that could raise security \nconcerns: \n(b) evidence (including, but not limited to, a credible allegation, an \nadmission, and matters of official record) of criminal conduct, regardless of \nwhether the individual was formally charged, prosecuted, or convicted. \nAG \u00b6 31(b) has been established. My discussions related to Sexual Behavior and \nPersonal Conduct are adopted herein. In July 2018, Applicant went to the university \nwhere he walked around on campus and purposefully exposed his genitals to persons \ninside of a food/cafeteria establishment through a window. He was standing outside \nflashing the people on the inside. He ran away from the area after he was noticed by \npeople inside the establishment and left the campus. He self-reported the incident to the \npolice. In November 2018, a summons was issued charging him with exposure of sexual \norgan. Upon his plea of No Contest, in November 2018, the court suspended imposition \n11 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \nof sentence and placed him on probation for the term of six months; ordered him to stay \naway from the location of the offense; ordered him to have no contact with the victim; and \ndirected him to continue counseling. He successfully completed his probation and it was \nterminated on December 4, 2019. That was the sole allegation against him under \nGuideline J. \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions under AG \u00b6 32 that could \nmitigate security concerns arising from Criminal Conduct: \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur and \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; and \n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including, but not limited \nto, the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, restitution, \ncompliance with the terms of parole or probation, job training or higher \neducation, \ngood \nemployment \nrecord, \nor \nconstructive \ncommunity \ninvolvement. \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 32(a) and 32(d) apply. Appellant\u2019s sole alleged criminal conduct incident, \nwhen he exposed his genitals on the university campus, occurred in July 2018, over three \nand one-half years ago. There is substantial evidence of successful rehabilitation; \nincluding, but not limited to, the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, \ncompliance with the terms of his court order and probation, and an otherwise outstanding \nemployment record. Applicant not only acknowledged the behavior, he self-reported it, to \nthe police, his family, and to his employer. He took immediate steps to address his \nbehavior and engaged the professional services of a licensed psychologist. After a \nsignificant number of treatment sessions, that psychologist\u2019s professional opinion was \nthat the Exhibitionistic Disorder \u2013 the actual basis for the sexual behavior and criminal \nconduct \u2013 is in full remission. Thus, the stressors, circumstances, or factors that \ncontributed to Applicant\u2019s untrustworthy, unreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, have \nbeen alleviated, and his criminal conduct no longer casts doubt on his current reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and good judgment. \nThe existence of a psychological condition does not preclude the granting of a \nsecurity clearance. Some conditions are unrelated to security issues and others can be \nmitigated by ongoing treatment or other factors. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the appellant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6 2(d): \n12 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. Moreover, I have \nevaluated the various aspects of this case in light of the totality of the record evidence \nand have not merely performed a piecemeal analysis. (See U.S. v. Bottone, 365 F.2d \n389, 392 (2d Cir. 1966)) \nThere is some evidence against mitigating Applicant\u2019s conduct. In July 2018, \nApplicant went to the university where he walked around on campus and purposefully \nexposed his genitals to persons inside of a food/cafeteria establishment through a \nwindow. He was standing outside flashing the people on the inside. He ran away from the \narea after he was noticed by people inside the establishment and left the campus. He \nself-reported the incident to the police. He was fired by his employer. In November 2018, \na summons was issued charging him with exposure of sexual organ. Upon his plea of No \nContest, in November 2018, the court suspended imposition of sentence and placed him \non probation for the term of six months. \nThe mitigating evidence under the whole-person concept is simply more \nsubstantial. Applicant is a 34-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has been \nserving as a software development lead with his current employer since October 2021. \nHe previously served as a software developer; software development lead; and \napplication developer. He received a bachelor\u2019s degree in 2010, and earned additional \ncollege credits towards a master\u2019s degree, but has not completed the requirements for \nsuch a degree. Applicant not only acknowledged the July 2018 behavior, he self-reported \nit to the police, his family, and to his employer. He took immediate steps to address his \nbehavior and engaged the professional services of a licensed psychologist. After a \nsignificant number of treatment sessions, that psychologist\u2019s professional opinion was \nthat the Exhibitionistic Disorder \u2013 the actual basis for the sexual behavior, criminal \nconduct, and the firing \u2013 is in full remission. His supervisors and colleagues think very \nhighly of him. He successfully completed his probation and it was terminated on \nDecember 4, 2019. \nOverall, the evidence leaves me without questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s \neligibility and suitability for a security clearance.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact In his answer, Applicant admitted SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b and denied SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c - 1.n. He asserted that the debts alleged in 1.c and 1.d had been resolved, and that the debts alleged in 1.e-1.n were no longer delinquent. His admissions are incorporated into my findings of fact.

Eligibility for access to classified \ninformation is denied. \nStatement of the Case \nApplicant submitted a security clearance application (SCA) on April 3, 2019. On \nMarch 26, 2021, the Department of Defense (DoD) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) \nto Applicant detailing security concerns under Guideline F, financial considerations. \nApplicant answered the SOR on February 11, 2022, and requested a hearing before an \nadministrative judge. The case was assigned to me on November 17, 2022. \nThe hearing was convened by video teleconference on January 24, 2023. \nDepartment Counsel submitted Government Exhibits (GE) 1-8. GE 1-4 and 8 were \nadmitted without objection. Applicant objected to GE 5-7. These exhibits were tax liens \nfor a person with a similar name to Applicant. He claimed that the liens were not his, and \nthe documents did not provide other identifying information. Department Counsel was \ngiven a week to provide verifying information.

He \nasserted that he requires this information to file his tax returns, because it will reduce his \ntax liability. During this time, he was a subcontractor, and no taxes or deductions were \ntaken out of payments made to him by the prime contractor. Applicant has not paid any \nfederal or state income taxes for tax years 2013-2019. He was told that he was required \nto make quarterly tax payments by his CPA but failed to do so. He claims that he will file \nincome tax returns for tax years 2013-2019 sometime in 2023, after he collects the \nnecessary business expense information for his accountant.

He \nprovided two unsigned and undated federal income tax returns showing that he owed \n$36,606 and $30,728 for these years, respectively. He did not submit any documentary \nevidence regarding his state income tax returns for these years. During the hearing we \ndiscussed the insufficiency of the evidence provided, but he did not provide sufficient \ndocumentation after the hearing showing that these returns had been filed or that any \npayments have been made to the IRS or the state. (Tr. 27-35, 77-102; AE D) \nSOR \u00b6 1.c is a credit card account placed for collection for $7,750. This debt was \nsubsequently charged off. Applicant claimed that he had the bill for this account paid \nmonthly on autopay. He stated that he did not open the statements when he received \nthem. He claimed that at some point autopay stopped working and the creditor closed the \naccount for non-payment without his knowledge. He claimed that this debt has been paid, \nbut he did not provide sufficient documentation supporting that assertion. He did provide \na one-page document showing that he made monthly payments from November 2017 to \nMarch 2020, but it does not show the amounts paid or that there is a zero balance. This \ndebt is unresolved. (Tr. 35-38, 105-108; GE 2; AE K) \nSOR \u00b6 1.d is a credit card account that has been charged off for $222. Applicant \nclaimed that he stopped using this credit card, but he was still charged an annual fee. \nSince he did not look at the statements, the fee was unpaid and the account was charged \noff. He claimed that this debt has been paid, but he did not provide sufficient \ndocumentation showing that it is resolved. (Tr. 38-40,102-105; GE 2, 3, 4; AE E) \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.e-1.n are past-due student loan accounts totaling $98,128. Applicant \nstated that these accounts are from his undergraduate and graduate education. He \nclaimed that he was behind on payments from about July 2017 to about May 2019 \nbecause his pay was delayed about three months after he started a new contract. He \nclaimed that after about three months, he resumed his regular monthly payment, and \ncaught up on his payments in about May 2019. He did not contact the lender to resolve \nthe issue. He claimed that the loans were put into the COVID-19 forbearance program \nafter March 2020. (Tr. 40-42, 97-102, 114; GE 2, 3) \nPost hearing, Applicant submitted a document showing his record of student-loan \npayments. It shows that he started repayment in April 2013 and made monthly payments \nuntil January 2017. In 2017, he missed payments for four non-consecutive months. In \n2018, he missed payments for five non-consecutive months. In 2019, he missed \npayments for three non-consecutive months and the loans were listed as 120 days or \ngreater past due on his credit report from that year. His last payment was in March 2020. \nHis February 2022 credit report shows the loans as current because they are in the \nforbearance program. (GE 3; AE J) \nApplicant did not provide documentation of his current finances, to include his \nmonthly income or expenses, or his savings. When questioned about these matters at \nthe hearing, he was evasive in answering some questions, and failed to provide requested \ndocumentation to substantiate his claims. He reported his gross income is about \n$250,000 yearly, and that his wife earns about $12,000 yearly.

Two of his children have cars from 2015 that he purchased for them. Every \nmonth, he puts money into his investments, in varying amounts. He reported taking three \nsignificant vacations in the last four years, including Europe in 2018, Mexico in 2020, and \nthe Caribbean in 2021. He and his wife own a home that they bought in 2014, which he \nasserts is now valued at almost $900,000. He is also an investor in a home which he \nclaims is valued at over $400,000. He has not had credit counseling. (Tr. 52-77; 116-118; \nGE 1; AE F)  \nApplicant submitted a professional character letter which stated that he is a skilled, \nreliable, and professional worker. He submitted a personal character letter in which the \nwriter stated that he was unaware that Applicant had any financial concerns or difficulties. \n(AE G, I) \nPolicies \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG), which became \neffective on June 8, 2017. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in conjunction \nwith the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation of potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds.  \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and  \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income tax \nreturns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as required. \nThe SOR allegations are established by the Applicant\u2019s admissions and the record \nevidence.

Applicant failed to provide sufficient documentation \nshowing that his tax issues or delinquent credit card debts are resolved, or that any of \nalleged SOR debts became delinquent under such circumstances that are unlikely to \nrecur. His failure to make consistent student loan payments is recent, and his failure to \nresolve his delinquent debts and timely file his income tax returns is long-term, ongoing, \nand unresolved. This continues to cast doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, \nand good judgment. \nAG \u00b6 20(b) does not apply. There is insufficient evidence to show that Applicant\u2019s \nfinancial problems occurred under circumstances beyond his control, and that he acted \nresponsibly under the circumstances. \nAG \u00b6 20(d) does not apply. Although his student loans were apparently placed in \nthe COVID-19 forbearance program after March 2020, he did not have a consistent record \nof payments for about three years prior to the COVID pause, and he did not provide an \nadequate explanation about why his student loans accounts remained delinquent for so \nlong. Applicant provided insufficient documentary evidence to support his claims that he \nmade payments to bring his delinquent student loans to current status in 2019. \nAG \u00b6 20(g) does not apply. The record shows that Applicant has not met his tax \nfiling obligations since 2012. He admits failing to file federal and state income tax returns \nfor tax years 2013-2019 and provided insufficient evidence that he filed income tax returns \nfor tax years 2020 and 2021. He has also testified that the prime contractor did not \nwithhold federal or state income taxes from payments made to him as a subcontractor \nduring this time period. Further, the record does not include sufficient evidence that he \nhas paid federal or state income taxes since at least 2012. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFailure to comply with tax laws suggests that an applicant has a problem with \nabiding by well-established government rules and systems.

A person who fails repeatedly to fulfill his or \nher legal obligations, such as paying taxes when due, does not demonstrate the high \ndegree of good judgment and reliability required of those granted access to classified \ninformation. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 17-01382 at 4 (App. Bd. May 16, 2018). \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the\nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the potentially \ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and circumstances \nsurrounding this case. I considered his character letters. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. \nI have considered Applicant\u2019s long-standing and ongoing failure to file required \nfederal and state income tax returns, and his apparent failure to pay federal and state \nincome taxes due. I have also considered that he and his wife drive luxury cars, take \nexpensive vacations, and that he continues to fund his investment accounts, while \nignoring basic legal obligations with regard to his income taxes. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and serious doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. Applicant failed to mitigate \nthe security concerns under Guideline F. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nSubparagraph 1.a- 1.n: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIt is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant a security \nclearance.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact In his response to the SOR, Applicant admitted, with extensive comments, nearly all of the SOR allegations pertaining to criminal conduct (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a. through 1.d. and 1.f., and 1.g.) and personal conduct (SOR \u00b6 3.c. and 3.d.). Applicant\u2019s admissions and his comments are incorporated herein. After a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, and upon due consideration of same, I make the following findings of fact: Background Applicant is a 31-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has been serving as a help-desk technician since August 2018. He previously held a variety of full-time and part-time positions (exchange administrator, cyber watch officer, construction security assistant, package handler, security officer, substitute teacher, patient-care technician, patient transporter, and environmental services) with different employers. He is a 2008 high school graduate. He enlisted in the US. Navy Reserve in November 2014, and served on active duty until June 2015, when he was honorably discharged as a seaman (E-3), and transferred to the Inactive Reserve.

On May 12, 2020, the Defense Counterintelligence \nand Security Agency (DCSA) Consolidated Adjudications Facility (CAF) issued a \nStatement of Reasons (SOR) to him, under Executive Order (Exec.

The SOR recommended referral to an administrative \njudge to determine whether a clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or \nrevoked. \nOn an unspecified date, Applicant responded to the SOR, and he elected to have \nhis case decided on the written record in lieu of a hearing. The administrative record is \nsilent until December 15, 2020, when his attorney entered a Notice of Representation and \nnoted that Applicant had previously erroneously indicated a waiver of a hearing, and now \nhe was requesting a hearing before an administrative judge. Department Counsel \nindicated the Government was prepared to proceed on December 20, 2020. The case \nwas assigned to me on January 14, 2021. A Notice of Hearing was issued on February \n5, 2021, scheduling the hearing for February 18, 2021. Upon the request of Applicant, the \nhearing was postponed and continued. On February 26, 2021, a new Notice of Hearing \nwas issued. I convened the hearing as scheduled on March 15, 2021. \nDuring the hearing, Government Exhibits (GE) 1 through GE 11, and Applicant \nExhibits (AE) A through AE J were admitted into evidence without objection. Applicant \ntestified. The transcript (Tr.) was received on March 29, 2021. The record closed on \nMarch 15, 2021. \nFindings of Fact \nIn his response to the SOR, Applicant admitted, with extensive comments, nearly \nall of the SOR allegations pertaining to criminal conduct (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a. through 1.d. and \n1.f., and 1.g.) and personal conduct (SOR \u00b6 3.c. and 3.d.). Applicant\u2019s admissions and \nhis comments are incorporated herein. After a complete and thorough review of the \nevidence in the record, and upon due consideration of same, I make the following findings \nof fact: \nBackground \nApplicant is a 31-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has been serving \nas a help-desk technician since August 2018. He previously held a variety of full-time and \npart-time positions (exchange administrator, cyber watch officer, construction security \nassistant, package handler, security officer, substitute teacher, patient-care technician, \npatient transporter, and environmental services) with different employers. He is a 2008 \nhigh school graduate. He enlisted in the US. Navy Reserve in November 2014, and \nserved on active duty until June 2015, when he was honorably discharged as a seaman \n(E-3), and transferred to the Inactive Reserve. He is currently in the same military status. \nHe was granted a security clearance in 2014, but because of issues discussed further \nbelow, that clearance was suspended in November 2017, reinstated in July 2018, and \nagain suspended in April 2019. The most recent suspension is the basis for this security \nclearance eligibility review. He was married in 2017. He has three children, born in 2012, \n2014, and 2015, as well as one stepchild, born in 2010. \n2 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nMilitary Awards and Decorations \nDuring his period of active duty, Applicant received the National Defense Service \nMedal and the Navy Marksman Ribbon for pistol and rifle. (AE I) \nCriminal Conduct and Personal Conduct \nApplicant is involved in an extremely volatile and hostile relationship with the \nmother of one of his children, and that relationship that has led to numerous conflicts and \nnegative interaction that resulted in Applicant\u2019s repeated engagements with law \nenforcement authorities and the court system. The SOR alleged seven different incidents \nof criminal conduct, which also were alleged separately under personal conduct. Five of \nthe incidents, and possibly six of them, because Applicant could not recall one particular \nincident, consisted of interactions involving the same participants during 2016 \u2013 2019 \nassociated with a custody dispute over their child: Applicant, and the mother of the \nparticular child, who repeatedly brought charges against him, essentially for variations of \ndomestic violence, including assault, child abuse, and trespassing; and the eventual \nresolution of the various criminal charges, with the charges associated with the six \nincidents dismissed nolle prosequi or placed in a Stet status. The seventh incident was \nunrelated to the others, and it referred to an incident involving Applicant\u2019s operation of a \nmotor vehicle while intoxicated, with additional charges, during Mardi Gras, for which he \nwas convicted. \nBecause the child\u2019s mother continued to interfere with, if not actually prohibit, \nApplicant\u2019s attempts to see his daughter, in 2015, he filed for custody. (Tr. at 25-26) At \nthat point, the situation turned from interference with his visitation rights to increased \nhostility involving repeated accusations and criminal complaints against him. The \nincidents and their eventual results are as follows: \nSOR \u00b6 1.f. refers to an incident that actually took place in January 2016, not June \n2016, as alleged in the SOR, when Applicant went to the residence of his child and her \nmother to exercise his child visitation rights. A verbal dispute took place when the mother \nrefused to allow Applicant to leave the residence with their daughter. Applicant initially \nrefused to answer any questions regarding the incident, and did not leave the residence \nwhen asked to do so. Eventually, he did slowly leave the building, but stopped \nperiodically. He was arrested, handcuffed, and transported to the police station for \nprocessing. He was charged with (1) failure to obey a reasonable and lawful order; and \n(2) trespass on private property, both misdemeanors. In July 2016, all charges were \ndismissed nolle prosequi because the State Attorney acknowledged that there was a \ncustody agreement in place. (GE 2, at 7-8; GE 3, at 3-4; GE 7, at 1-4, 31-32; AE D, at 10)  \nSOR \u00b6 1.g. refers to an incident that actually took place in June 2016, not January \n2016, as alleged in the SOR, when Applicant went to the residence of his child and her \nmother to exercise his child visitation rights. A verbal dispute turned physical when the \nmother refused to allow Applicant to leave the residence with their daughter. The mother, \ndesignated the \u201cvictim\u201d by the police, told the responding police officers that when she \ntried to stop Applicant from leaving with their daughter, he started strangling her with both \n3 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nhands around her neck for \u201cabout 3 minutes.\u201d As he attempted to depart, the victim started \npulling on his shirt, but he pushed her down. One arresting officer initially noted a slight \nredness on the victim\u2019s neck, but after taking photos of the neck, the redness was no \nlonger observable. Another arresting officer noted scratch marks on Applicant\u2019s neck. \nApplicant denied attempting to strangle the woman. Applicant was charged with (1) \nassault in the 2nd degree; (2) failure to obey a reasonable and lawful order; and (3) \ntrespass on private property, all misdemeanors. A handgun in his car was turned over to \nthe police at the time of the arrest, but it was later returned to him. (GE 7) In July 2016, \nall charges were dismissed nolle prosequi. (GE 2, at 8; GE 3, at 4; GE 7, at 1-2, 5-26, 28-\n30; AE D, at 9) \nSOR \u00b6 1.e. refers to an incident that reportedly took place in August 2016. No facts \nregarding the circumstances of the incident were submitted by either party, and Applicant \ndid not recall the event. For some unexplained reasons, Applicant was arrested and \ncharged with (1) trespass on private property; (2) malicious destruction of property less \nthan $500; (3) and disorderly conduct, all misdemeanors. In March 2017, all charges were \ndismissed nolle prosequi. (GE 3, at 4-5; GE 8, at 6-7; AE D, at 7-9) \nIn January 2017, an Amended Order was issued by the court ordering that \nApplicant and the child\u2019s mother shall have joint legal custody of the minor child. Among \nthe compliance requirements were that all conversations, interactions, and dealings of \nany sort between the parties shall be conducted in a civil and courteous manner; they \nshall not place the child in a stressful or traumatic situation as a result of conflict between \nthe parties; and neither party shall disparage the other party in front of the minor child. \n(AE E)  \nSOR \u00b6 1.c. refers to an incident that took place on September 30, 2018. Applicant \nand his wife met with the child\u2019s mother and her boyfriend at a mall to exchange physical \ncustody of their daughter pursuant to the child custody agreement. An exchange of verbal \ncomments was followed by certain gestures, and a mutual physical assault occurred. The \ntwo women attacked each other. Both women sustained scratches on their faces, arms, \nand feet. The child\u2019s mother claimed that Applicant \u201cstrangled\u201d her, allowing his wife to \nscratch her face. In addition, she accused Applicant of holding her from behind for about \none minute, during which she could not breathe. Applicant claimed that the mother \npunched him in the face, but acknowledged trying to separate the two women. The \nresponding police officer noted small scratch marks on Applicant\u2019s arms but no noticeable \nfacial injuries. One witness acknowledged that all four individuals were involved in the \nbrawl, but did not specifically recall Applicant choking the mother.  (GE 8, at 9-18) The \nfollowing day, Applicant was arrested and charged with (1) assault in the 2nd degree; and \n(2) reckless endangerment, both misdemeanors. In January 2019, all charges were \ndismissed nolle prosequi. (GE 2, at 9-10, 16; GE 3, at 5-6; GE 6; AE D, at 1) \nSOR \u00b6 1.b. refers to an incident that took place in January 2019. At the time of the \nincident, the child was temporarily residing in Applicant\u2019s residence during a week of \ncustody. When she returned from school one particular Thursday, he noticed that she \nwas acting strangely because she had received a referral at school for striking another \nchild and not listening at school.

He claimed that he did not bruise her. When the \nchild eventually returned to her mother on the following Monday, the mother found her to \nbe oddly quiet. The mother noticed a bruise on the child\u2019s thigh and wrist. She called the \npolice. The authorities called Child Protective Services, and the child was placed in her \nmother\u2019s emergency protective custody. Shortly thereafter, upon learning that there was \na warrant for his arrest, he turned himself into the authorities. They charged him with (1) \nchild abuse in the 2nd  degree \u2013 custody; (2) child abuse in the 2nd  degree \u2013 house; (3) \nassault in the 2nd  degree; and (4) reckless endangerment, the first two charges being \nfelonies, and the remaining charges both misdemeanors. Charges (1) and (2) were \nmerged into charge (2), and charges (3) and (4) were merged into charge (3)(GE 2, at 9; \nGE 3, at 5-6; GE 5, at 2-7) In June 2019, both charges were \u201cclosed\u201d when a Stet notice \nwas issued, placing them on an inactive docket and forgotten by the state. Applicant was \nrequired at attend anger management, to be completed within six months, and to avoid \nunlawful contact with the minor child. (GE 11; GE 5, at 12-16) \nSOR \u00b6 1.a. refers to a series of alleged violations that took place over an \nunspecified period that eventually resulted in Applicant\u2019s arrest in March 2019. He was \ncharged with seven violations, all of which were misdemeanors, such as violation of \nconditional release, violation of release, violation of release conditions, and failure to obey \ncourt order. All of the charges were associated with the criminal charges, already \ndiscussed above, for which those charges were dismissed nolle prosequi or placed on \nthe Stet docket. All of these charges were placed on the Stet docket in June 2019. (GE \n3, at 6-7; GE 4) \nAlthough it was not alleged in the SOR, there was another incident between the \nsame two protagonists that took place in August 2020 during another custody exchange. \nApplicant reportedly removed his daughter\u2019s watch and placed it on the hood of the \nmother\u2019s automobile, purportedly scratching the car. The mother got out of the car to \nreturn the watch to their daughter, but as she attempted to hand it to the child, Applicant \nrolled up the window and started to drive away, almost running over the mother\u2019s foot. \nShe managed to return the watch, but Applicant took it and threw it out the window. \nApplicant disputed her allegations and claimed she came over to his car and kicked it, \nand then she reached inside the window and hit him in the face. (Tr. at 31) After the \nmother reported the incident to the police, Applicant was eventually arrested and charged \nwith (1) malicious destruction of property less than $1,000. (GE 10) The matter has not \nyet been resolved. (GE 9) \nUnalleged conduct can be considered for certain purposes, as discussed by the \nDOHA Appeal Board. (Conduct not alleged in an SOR may be considered: (a) to assess \nan applicant's credibility; (b) to evaluate an applicant's evidence of extenuation, \nmitigation, or changed circumstances; (c) to consider whether an applicant has \ndemonstrated successful rehabilitation; (d) to decide whether a particular provision of the \nAdjudicative Guidelines is applicable; or (e) to provide evidence for whole-person analysis \nunder Directive \u00a7 6.3.).

Applicant\u2019s unalleged criminal conduct will be \nconsidered only for the five purposes listed above. \nApplicant is remorseful about the situation with the mother of his child, and his sole \ndesire is to maintain a healthy and loving relationship with the child. Because of the \nrepeated situation, he requested and obtained mutual protective orders and has altered \nthe location of the child custody exchanges away from the mother\u2019s residence, initially\nrequesting that they take place at the police barracks. (GE 2, at 10) In addition, he has \nattempted to limit conversations to email. He now seeks alternative ways to discipline his\ndaughter when discipline is necessary. In October 2018, he successfully completed a 6-\nhour Co-Parenting/Divorce Class (AE F), and he routinely participates in family, as well \nas, class activities with his daughter. (AE C; AE H) \n \n \n \nAs noted above, there is also one incident that is vastly different from the ones \ninvolving the mother of his child. SOR \u00b6 1.d. refers to an incident that occurred during \nMardi Gras in February 2017, when Applicant got behind the wheel of his automobile after \nconsuming too much beer and becoming intoxicated. He was stopped by the police and \nadministered a breathalyzer. The reading was 0.98. He was arrested by the police and \ncharged with (1) operating a vehicle while intoxicated (DWI); (2) operating a vehicle with \na suspended license; and (3) procedure on approach of an authorized emergency vehicle \n(similar to failure to yield the right of way), all misdemeanors. He was ordered to perform \n40 hours of community service and fined $900. (GE 3, at 2; GE 2, at 9; AE A) \nAdditional Personal Conduct \nIn addition to the joint criminal conduct and personal conduct issues described \nabove, the SOR also alleged three incidents of personal conduct, not criminal conduct, \nwhich raised additional security clearance issues associated with his failure or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations, thus questioning his reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and ability to protect classified or sensitive information. Those incidents \nand their eventual results are as follows: \nSOR \u00b6 2.d. refers to an incident that reportedly took place in June 2016 when he \nwas terminated from the city public charter school for failure to meet performance \nstandards. He was initially hired in August 2013 as a substitute teacher and intern in a \nspecific health-care program managing approximately 40 students over three classes of \ndiffering content. When a certified teacher was hired for that position, Applicant was \nmoved into another internship with the health and physical education teacher in the \nmiddle grades. At the end of his first year at the school, his supervisor, the school principal \nretired. During the second year, Applicant was a health teacher, but his mentor was a \nmath teacher. Teaching on his own, he struggled because he was in over his head and \nneeded help, but it was apparently not given to him. At the end of the year, the new \nprincipal informed him that the health program was no longer to be offered and the \nteaching position was going to be abolished. Applicant was given referrals to other \nschools looking for health teachers. Applicant admitted that he was placed on a \nperformance improvement plan (PIP), but otherwise denied ever being told that his \nperformance was substandard.

(GE 2, at 12-13; AE B, at 4; \nAnswer to the SOR, at 1, 3) Other than the fact that Applicant initially admitted the \nallegation, there is no other evidence to contradict Applicant\u2019s other descriptions of his \nrelationship with the school system or how or why that relationship ended. \nSOR \u00b6 2.c. refers to an incident that took place in January 2017 when he was \nterminated from his employment with a multinational technology company, where he had \nbeen working in package direction, for falling asleep while on shift. At the time, he had \nbeen working at multiple jobs, and on this one occasion he fell asleep while on break \nworking the night shift. He was called into the office and fired. Applicant acknowledged \nthat he had placed himself in a position where he had taken on more than he should have, \nand he pledged not to put himself in another similar situation in the future. (GE 2, at 6; \nAnswer to the SOR, at 3) \nSOR \u00b6 2.b. refers to an incident that reportedly took place in December 2017 when \nhe was terminated from his employment with a corporation that was sponsoring him for a \nsecurity clearance after it had previously been suspended. He was in the process of \ncompleting a new SF 86 and assumed that the information appearing in his original SF \n86 would be sufficient. However, because of new developments, the new SF 86 was \nincomplete. By the time the entire security clearance eligibility process was completed \nand his security clearance was reinstated, the employer no longer had the position \navailable for him. He denied that he was terminated. (GE 2, at 6; Answer to the SOR, at \n3; Tr. at 33) There is no evidence to contradict Applicant\u2019s description of his relationship \nwith the employer or how or why that relationship ended. \nCharacter References and Work Performance \nApplicant\u2019s first city charter-school supervisor and principal, and a veteran, noted \nthat Applicant connected with the students in a way that many new teachers can\u2019t, which \ncontributed to his success while assigned to his position. Applicant was considered a \ndefinite asset to the school program. His \u201ccan-do attitude for any task assigned, his \nwillingness to go the extra mile, and his ability to develop relationships with all students \nand adults he came into contact with was a trait necessary to be successful in any course \nof work. . . .\u201d (AE B, at 4) \nApplicant\u2019s uncle, an ophthalmologist and a veteran, described Applicant in \nglowing terms: he maintained a 3.0 grade point average while he played football, \n\u201cdemonstrating versatility and a multifocal approach toward achievement\u201d; he was a \nvolunteer tutor for elementary, middle, and high school students; he honed critical skills \nin the health profession while working in the emergency room at the shock trauma center \nat a large medical center; he became a certified educator in the state; and he has a \nconstant will to overcome obstacles.

(AE J; AE K) \nApplicant\u2019s two most recent U.S. Naval Reserve Evaluation Report and Counseling \nRecords reflect that he is a vital member of the unit who displays the ability for increased \nresponsibilities. He is a solid and proven performer who produces quality work and \napproaches each endeavor with a positive attitude and without complaint, in a timely \nmanner ensuring his dependability. He has unlimited growth potential, and he should be \npromoted early. He either meets or is above the reported performance traits. (AE G) \nPolicies \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the Executive \nBranch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security emphasizing, \n\u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d (Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. \n518, 528 (1988)) As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to control \naccess to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual \nis sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information. The President has \nauthorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant an applicant eligibility for \naccess to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to do so.\u201d (Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information Within \nIndustry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified.) \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the guidelines in SEAD 4. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the guidelines list potentially disqualifying \nconditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility \nfor access to classified information. \nAn administrative judge need not view the guidelines as inflexible, ironclad rules \nof law. Instead, acknowledging the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. The entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known \nas the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a meaningful decision. \nIn the decision-making process, facts must be established by \u201csubstantial \nevidence.\u201d \u201cSubstantial evidence [is] such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might \naccept as adequate to support a conclusion in light of all contrary evidence in the record.\u201d \n(ISCR Case No. 04-11463 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2006) (citing Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1)) \n8 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d  (See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th  Cir. 1994)) \nThe Government initially has the burden of producing evidence to establish a \npotentially disqualifying condition under the Directive, and has the burden of establishing \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Once the Government has produced substantial \nevidence of a disqualifying condition, under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant has the \nburden of persuasion to present evidence in refutation, explanation, extenuation or \nmitigation, sufficient to overcome the doubts raised by the Government\u2019s case. The \nburden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government. (See ISCR \nCase No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sept. 22, 2005)) \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours as well. It is \nbecause of this special relationship that the Government must be able to repose a high \ndegree of trust and confidence in those individuals to whom it grants access to classified \ninformation. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the \napplicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. Such \ndecisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather \nthan actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Furthermore, \u201csecurity clearance \ndeterminations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d (Egan, 484 U.S. at 531) \nClearance decisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense \nbe a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d (See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 \n7) Thus, nothing in this decision should be construed to suggest that I have based this \ndecision, in whole or in part, on any express or implied determination as to Applicant\u2019s \nallegiance, loyalty, or patriotism. It is merely an indication the Applicant has or has not \nmet the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for \nissuing a clearance.  In reaching this decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that \nare reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I \nhave avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \nAnalysis \nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Criminal Conduct is set out in AG \n\u00b6 30: \nCriminal activity creates doubt about a person's judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person's ability or \nwillingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations. \nThe guideline notes two conditions under AG \u00b6 31 that could raise security \nconcerns: \n9 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n(a) a pattern of minor offenses, any one of which on its own would be \nunlikely to affect a national security eligibility decision, but which in \ncombination cast doubt on the individual's judgment, reliability, or \ntrustworthiness;  \n(b) evidence (including, but not limited to, a credible allegation, an \nadmission, and matters of official record) of criminal conduct, regardless of \nwhether the individual was formally charged, prosecuted, or convicted; and \nAs noted above, during the three year period from 2016 through 2019, Applicant \nwas arrested and charged on seven different occasions for a variety of incidents, with all \nbut one of those incidents involving alleged violent behavior with the same woman \u2013 the \nmother of one of his children \u2013 who, since he was able to obtain joint custody of their \ndaughter in 2015, reported him to police and lodged the complaints that led to his arrests. \nAll of the six arrests eventually resulted in all charges being dismissed nolle prosequi or \nplaced on the Stet calendar. The one other incident, in 2017, was isolated and unrelated \nto the others, as it was for several driving violations, including DWI, for which he was fined \nand ordered to perform community service. Based on those seven incidents described \nabove, AG \u00b6\u00b6 31(a) and 31(b) have been established. \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions under AG \u00b6 32 that could \nmitigate security concerns arising from criminal conduct. They include: \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur and \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment;  \n(c) no reliable evidence to support that the individual committed the offense; \nand   \n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including, but not limited \nto, the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, restitution, \ncompliance with the terms of parole or probation, job training or higher \neducation, \ngood \nemployment \nrecord, \nor \nconstructive \ncommunity \ninvolvement. \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 32(a), 32 (c), and 32(d) fully or partially apply. As noted above, Applicant is \ninvolved in an extremely volatile and hostile relationship with the mother of one of his \nchildren, and that relationship that has led to numerous conflicts and negative interaction \nthat resulted in Applicant\u2019s being repeatedly engaged with law enforcement authorities \nand the court system. On each occasion, the woman\u2019s version of the events \u2013 the sole \nsource of the information presented to the police \u2013 was accepted by the arresting police \nofficers, even when there was little or no independent evidence that her versions were \ntruthful. It is especially noteworthy that she reported that Applicant had attempted to \nstrangle her with both hands around her neck \u201cfor three minutes\u201d on one occasion when \nthere were no other witnesses, and that he tried to strangle her again on another occasion \n10 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nwhen there were witnesses who refuted her accusations. Applicant disputed much of \nwhat she had described, and he steadfastly denied the allegations both to the \nprosecutorial authorities and the judges before whom he appeared. With few exceptions, \nhis explanations have gone unrebutted. Several of the charges, especially those related \nto child abuse, assault, reckless endangerment, and malicious destruction of property, \nwere investigated by the prosecuting authorities or the Child Family Services, and those \ncriminal charges were dismissed. Examining the rather sketchy and incomplete damaging \ndocumentary evidence submitted against him, and the substantial number of dismissals, \nleads to a conclusion that Applicant\u2019s explanations are essentially true. \nThe lone independent criminal charges \u2013 the ones associated with his 2017 DWI \nduring Mardi Gras \u2013 occurred four years ago, and such conduct was not repeated. He \nacknowledged that his actions were foolish, and he has modified both his alcohol \nconsumption and driving after consuming alcohol. Considering the period of time since \nthat incident, it appears that it is unlikely to recur. He has been described as \u201ca driven and \ntalented young man with outstanding moral character,\u201d and he is dependable. His positive \nactivities with youth as well as his substantial volunteer work in the healthcare system \nseem to be at odds with the characteristics described by the woman who shares their \nchild\u2019s physical custody with him. \nA person should not be held forever accountable for misconduct from the past, and \nin this instance the most recent alleged criminal conduct \u2013 which had also been closed \u2013 \nis two years ago. With the expectation that other criminal complaints will probably be filed \nagainst him by the same woman, there are, nevertheless, no realistic concerns about \nfuture criminal conduct. Applicant\u2019s past history of alleged criminal conduct, under the \ncircumstances, no longer casts doubt on his reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment. \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Personal Conduct is set out in \nAG \u00b6 15: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. The following will normally result in \nan unfavorable national security eligibility determination, security clearance \naction, or cancellation of further processing for national security eligibility: \n(a) refusal, or failure without reasonable cause, to undergo or \ncooperate with security processing, including but not limited \nto meeting with a security investigator for subject interview, \ncompleting security forms or releases, cooperation with \nmedical \nor \npsychological \nevaluation, \nor \npolygraph \nexamination, if authorized and required; and \n11 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(b) refusal to provide full, frank, and truthful answers to lawful \nquestions of investigators, security officials, or other official \nrepresentatives in connection with a personnel security or \ntrustworthiness determination. \nThe guideline also includes an example of a condition that could raise security \nconcerns under AG \u00b6 16: \n(c) credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is\nnot sufficient for an adverse determination under any other single guideline, \nbut which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-person\nassessment of questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack \nof candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations, or other \ncharacteristics indicating that the individual may not properly safeguard \nclassified or sensitive information. \n \n \nMy discussion related to Applicant\u2019s criminal conduct is adopted herein. In addition \nto the criminal conduct allegations discussed above, Applicant was allegedly involved in \nthree incidents or situations that brought into question his personal conduct: being \nterminated from employment. There is a scarcity of evidence presented by the \nGovernment, and aside from Applicant\u2019s comments, all of the evidence presented is from \nhim, and there is no independent evidence from the employers that support the \nallegations. Applicant denied having been terminated from one employer and contended, \nwithout rebuttal, that he was not terminated, but that once his security clearance was \nreinstated, there was no longer a position open for him. While he acknowledged being on \na PIP, he denied being terminated from the charter school and contended that he was \nrecommended for a school position at other schools. Other than the fact that Applicant \ninitially admitted the allegation, there is no other evidence to contradict or rebut \nApplicant\u2019s other descriptions of his relationship with the school system or how or why \nthat relationship ended. He was admittedly terminated from another position when he fell \nasleep during the night shift during a period when he was working multiple jobs. There is \nno evidence to rebut his comments regarding that situation. As to the allegations \nregarding the alleged personal conduct, with respect to SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.a. and 2.c., AG \u00b6 16(c) \nhas been established. However, with respect to SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.b. and 2.d., AG \u00b6 16(c) has not \nbeen established. \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions under AG \u00b6 17 that could \nmitigate security concerns arising from personal conduct. They include: \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, \n12 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \nunreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to \nrecur; and \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate vulnerability \nto exploitation, manipulation, or duress. \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 17(c), 17(d) and 17(e) apply. My comments associated with the criminal \nconduct section also apply in an assessment of personal conduct concerns. Applicant \nhas taken various steps to insulate himself from the ire of his child\u2019s mother; modify his \ndriving habits after consuming alcohol; and taken a more realistic approach to life without \nextending himself beyond his capabilities to avoid situations such as the one where he \nfell asleep on the job while holding multiple jobs. Those who know him attest to his \ntrustworthiness, reliability, and outstanding performance. It is highly unlikely that \nApplicant\u2019s alleged personal conduct, especially that which was associated with his \ncriminal conduct, will recur. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I have evaluated the \nvarious aspects of this case in light of the totality of the record evidence and have not \nmerely performed a piecemeal analysis. See U.S. v. Bottone, 365 F.2d 389, 392 (2d Cir. \n1966); see also ISCR Case No. 03-22861 at 2-3 (App. Bd. Jun. 2, 2006). \nApplicant was involved in seven different incidents of criminal conduct, which also \nwere alleged separately under personal conduct. Five, and possibly six, of those incidents \nconsisted of interactions involving the same participants during 2016 \u2013 2019 associated \nwith a custody dispute over their child: Applicant, and the mother of the particular child, \nwho repeatedly brought charges against him, essentially for variations of domestic \nviolence, including assault, child abuse, and trespassing; and the eventual resolution of \nthe various criminal charges, with the charges associated with the six incidents dismissed \nnolle prosequi or placed in a Stet status. The seventh incident was unrelated to the others, \n13 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nand it referred to an incident involving Applicant\u2019s operation of a motor vehicle while \nintoxicated, with additional charges, during Mardi Gras, for which he was convicted. He \nwas also fired by one employer because he fell asleep while on the job. While he was \ngranted a security clearance in 2014, that clearance was suspended in November 2017, \nreinstated in July 2018, and again suspended in April 2019.  \nThe mitigating evidence is simply more substantial and compelling. Applicant is a \n31-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has been serving as a help-desk \ntechnician since August 2018. He previously held a variety of full-time and part-time \npositions (exchange administrator, cyber watch officer, construction security assistant, \npackage handler, security officer, substitute teacher, patient-care technician, patient \ntransporter, and environmental services) with different employers. He is a 2008 high \nschool graduate. He enlisted in the US. Navy Reserve in November 2014, and served on \nactive duty until June 2015, when he was honorably discharged as a seaman (E-3), and \ntransferred to the Inactive Reserve. He is currently in the same military status. His military \nperformance reported that he is a solid and proven performer who produces quality work \nand approaches each endeavor with a positive attitude and without complaint, in a timely \nmanner ensuring his dependability. One character reference, a U.S. Navy chaplain, \ncharacterized him as \u201ca driven and talented young man with outstanding moral character.\u201d \nApplicant is involved in an extremely volatile and hostile relationship with the \nmother of one of his children, and that relationship that has led to numerous conflicts and \nnegative interaction that resulted in his being repeatedly engaged with law enforcement \nauthorities and the court system. He was involved in seven different incidents of criminal \nconduct, which also were alleged separately under personal conduct. Six of the incidents, \nassociated with a custody dispute over their child, were initiated when the child\u2019s mother \nrepeatedly brought charges against him. All of the charges were eventually dismissed \nnolle prosequi or placed in a Stet status. Applicant disputed much of what she had \ndescribed, and he steadfastly denied the allegations both to the prosecutorial authorities \nand the judges before whom he appeared. With few exceptions, his explanations have \ngone unrebutted. Several of the charges, especially those related to child abuse, assault, \nreckless endangerment, and malicious destruction of property, were investigated by the \nprosecuting authorities, or the Child Family Services, and those criminal charges were \ndismissed. While falling asleep while working during a period when he had multiple jobs \nis unacceptable in the workplace, and a poor performance in doing one\u2019s job in the \nworkplace may also be unacceptable, neither activity comes anywhere close to an \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations. \nOverall, the evidence leaves me without any questions or doubts as to Applicant\u2019s \neligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all of these reasons, I conclude \nApplicant has mitigated the security concerns arising from his criminal conduct and \npersonal conduct. See SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6\u00b6 2(d)(1) through AG 2(d)(9). \n14 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n                                        \n         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline J: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a. through 1.g.: \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline E: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 2.a. through 2.d.: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security clearance. \nEligibility for access to classified information is granted. \nROBERT ROBINSON GALES \nAdministrative Judge \n15 \n",

He reported that he used CBD \nproducts through vaping, creams, and gummies. He testified that he did not look at the \nCBD packaging to determine if the THC content was under the legal limit.1 He stated that \n1 The Security Executive Agent for the United States Government provided clarifying guidance \nconcerning marijuana on December 21, 2021. Part of that guidance addressed CBD products:  \nWith respect to the use of CBD products, agencies should be aware that using these \ncannabis derivatives may be relevant to adjudications in accordance with SEAD 4. \nAlthough the passage of the Agricultural Improvement Act of 2018 excluded hemp from \nthe definition of marijuana within the Controlled Substances Act, products containing \ngreater than a 0.3 percent concentration of delta-9 tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), a \npsychoactive ingredient in marijuana, do not meet the definition of \u201chemp.\u201d Accordingly, \nproducts labeled as hemp-derived that contain greater than 0.3 percent THC continue to \nmeet the legal definition of marijuana, and therefore remain illegal to use under federal law \nand policy. Additionally, agencies should be aware that the Federal Drug Administration \ndoes not certify levels of THC in CBD products, so the percentage of THC cannot be \nguaranteed, thus posing a concern pertaining to the use of a CBD product under federal \nlaw. Studies have shown that some CBD products exceed the 0.3 percent THC threshold \nfor hemp, notwithstanding advertising labels (Reference F). Therefore, there is a risk that \nusing these products may nonetheless cause sufficiently high levels of THC to result in a \npositive marijuana test under agency-administered employment or random drug testing \nprograms. Should an individual test positive, they will be subject to an investigation under \nspecific guidelines established by their home agency.   \n2 \n\n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nhis wife purchased it for him.

He admitted using it while possessing a security clearance and did \nnot estimate the number of times it was used. In his May 2018 SCA, he reported using \nTHC (marijuana) from 1978 through April 2018. He admitted using it while possessing a \nsecurity clearance.

At times, he used marijuana about three \ntimes a week, but he did not use it every week. He used marijuana at social gatherings \nand at home. He admitted the same timeline of marijuana use in his June 2020 response \nto interrogatories. (GE 3) \nApplicant testified that he infrequently used marijuana in the late 1980\u2019s and early \n1990\u2019s, when his children were young. He used it at social gatherings and at home with \nhis wife. He admitted his wife and many of his friends still use marijuana, and at times \nthey use it in his presence. He could not say that he would abstain from using marijuana \nin the future if he does not continue to possess a security clearance. He has never had \ndrug treatment or counseling. (Tr. 23-44) \nApplicant admitted that he used marijuana while possessing a security clearance \nand granted access to classified information. He first received a security clearance in \n1985 and has had access to classified information for almost the entire time since then. \nHe has been using marijuana throughout this period. He had to undergo preemployment \ndrug screening before starting new jobs in about 1995 and 2015. He stated that he \ntemporarily stopped using marijuana so that he could pass the preemployment drug tests. \n(Tr. 23-44) \nThe Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMSHA) provided a warning about \nCBD products on July 24, 2019:  \nStudies have shown that some CBD products\u2019 labeling does not accurately reflect their \ncontent. Cannabis based products containing a THC level greater than 0.3% on a dry \nweight basis do not fall under the Farm Bill\u2019s definition of hemp even if they are labeled as \nsuch. In one study, the amount of CBD in 69% of the 84 tested CBD products was \ninconsistent with that on the label, and some products contained unlabeled cannabinoids, \nincluding THC in amounts up to 6.4 mg/ml. As such, an employee\u2019s drug test may be \npositive for the THC metabolite, delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol-9-carboxylic acid (THCA), \ndue to THC in the CBD product.   \nSAMSHA further advised that \u201cfederal agencies should make every effort to inform applicants and \nemployees of the risk that using such products may result in a positive marijuana test.\u201d   \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nIn the \u201cYour Use of Illegal Drugs and Drug Activity\u201d section of his 2008 SCA, \nApplicant commented: \u201cI actually have no empirical evidence that the substance involved \nwas actually pot.

In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in conjunction \nwith the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. The protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 \n2(b) requires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national \nsecurity eligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR.

This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation of potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline H, Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nAG \u00b6 24 expresses the security concern regarding drug involvement: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of prescription \ndrugs, and the use of other substances that can cause physical or mental impairment or \nare used in a manner inconsistent with their intended use can raise questions about an \nindividual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior may lead to \nphysical or psychological impairment and because it raises questions about a person\u2019s \nability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations. Controlled substance \nmeans any \u201ccontrolled substance\u201d as defined in 21 U.S.C 802. Substance misuse is the \ngeneric term adopted in this guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above. \nI have considered the disqualifying conditions for drug involvement under AG \u00b6 25 \nand the following are potentially applicable: \n(a) any substance misuse (see above definition); \n(c) illegal possession of a controlled substance, including cultivation, \nprocessing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of \ndrug paraphernalia; \n(f) any illegal drug use while granted access to classified information or \nholding a sensitive position; and \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(g) expressed intent to continue drug involvement and substance misuse, \nor failure to clearly and convincingly commit to discontinue such misuse. \nThe Controlled Substances Act makes it illegal under federal law to manufacture, \npossess, or distribute certain drugs (Controlled Substances Act, 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 801, et seq. \nSee \u00a7 844). All controlled substances are classified into five schedules, based on their \naccepted medical uses, their potential for abuse, and their psychological and physical \neffects on the body. \u00a7\u00a7811, 812. Marijuana is classified as a Schedule I controlled \nsubstance, \u00a7812(c), based on its high potential for abuse, no accepted medical use, and \nno accepted safety for use in medically supervised treatment. \nApplicant admitted using marijuana over a 40-year period and using it while \ngranted access to classified information. He did not convincingly disavow future use of \nmarijuana. AG \u00b6\u00b6 25(a), 25(c), 25(f), and 25(g) apply. \nI have considered the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 26. The following are \npotentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; and  \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and substance \nmisuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and \nhas established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not limited to: (1) \ndisassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; (2) changing or \navoiding the environment where drugs were used; and (3) providing a \nsigned statement of intent to abstain from all drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, acknowledging that any future involvement is grounds \nfor revocation of national security eligibility. \nAG \u00b6 26(a) does not apply. Applicant used marijuana over a 40-year period, \nincluding while possessing a security clearance and having access to classified \ninformation. He knew that using illegal drugs while granted access to classified \ninformation or holding a sensitive position was not permitted, and that marijuana was an \nillegal drug. He minimized his marijuana use in past SCAs to gain a security clearance. \nHe stopped use to avoid detection on preemployment drug screening, and then resumed \nusing marijuana. He falsified his 2008 and 2018 SCAs by trying to hide material facts from \nthe government in stating that it was not clear that he had used marijuana, because he \nhad not tested it and it was not labeled. I cannot find his claims of abstinence credible, \nconsidering his history of minimizing and lying about his marijuana use. His marijuana \nuse was recent, frequent, and is likely to recur. It continues to cast doubt on his current \nreliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. \nAG \u00b6 26(b) does not apply. Applicant did not provide sufficient evidence to find that \nhe disassociated from drug using associates and contacts, or changed the environment \n6 \n\n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \nwhere marijuana is used.

Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes\u2026 \nI have considered the disqualifying conditions under AG \u00b6 16 and the following is \npotentially applicable. \n(c) credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is \nnot sufficient for an adverse determination under any other single guideline, \nbut which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-person \nassessment of questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack \nof candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations, or other \ncharacteristics indicating that the individual may not properly safeguard \nclassified or sensitive information; \n(f) violation of a written or recorded commitment made by the individual to \nthe employer as a condition of employment; and \n(g) association with persons involved in criminal activity. \nApplicant admitted using marijuana over a 40-year period and using it while \ngranted access to classified information and holding a sensitive position. Over the years, \nhe has not been truthful with the government and his employers about his use of \nmarijuana. He continues to associate with marijuana users and did not convincingly \ndisavow future use. AG \u00b6\u00b6 16(c), 16(f), and 16(g) apply. \nI have considered the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 17. The following is \npotentially applicable: \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment. \nAG \u00b6 17(c) does not apply.

There is insufficient evidence to conclude that it is unlikely to recur or \nthat it does not cast doubt on his reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the potentially \ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and circumstances \nsurrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under Guidelines H and E in my \nwhole-person analysis. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance. He did not provide sufficient evidence to \nmitigate the security concerns under Guideline H or Guideline E. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline H: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.b:  \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline E: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 2.a: \nAgainst Applicant \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nConclusion \nIt is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant a security \nclearance.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant, 35, has worked for his current employer, a federal contracting company, as an information technology professional since September 2018. He was initially granted access to classified information in April 2011 in connection with his service in the Army Reserve from March 2011 to April 2016. He submitted his most recent security application in December 3, 2018. He did not disclose any derogatory information. The background investigation revealed that Applicant owed $28,000 on seven delinquent debts. (GE 1, GE 5) Applicant blamed his financial problems on being young and immature, as well as a period of unemployment between March 2015 and February 2017. He incurred the debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.a in 2016. He rented a car for a friend in State 1. He claimed that while his friend had possession of the car, it was stolen and found in State 2 more than 300 miles away. The rental car company considered the vehicle a loss and sued Applicant to recover the value. In April 2019, the debtor was awarded a lien and judgment for $14,139.68. The debt remains unresolved. (Tr. 19-47; GE 2-6) The debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.b is the deficiency balance for a repossessed car. He purchased the car in 2012.

Applicant did not \nprovide evidence that he has addressed his delinquent debt. Clearance is denied. \nStatement of the Case \nOn July 8, 2022, the DOD issued a statement of reasons (SOR) detailing security \nconcerns under the financial considerations guideline. This action was taken under \nExecutive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry, \nsigned by President Eisenhower on February 20, 1960, as amended; as well as DOD \nDirective 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program, \ndated January 2, 1992, as amended (Directive); and the Adjudicative Guidelines for \nDetermining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information, implemented on June 8, \n2017. \nDOD adjudicators were unable to find that it is clearly consistent with the national \ninterest to continue Applicant\u2019s security clearance and recommended that the case be \nsubmitted to a Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) administrative judge for \n1 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \na determination whether to grant his security clearance.

After the hearing, I left the record open until September 1, 2023, to \nallow Applicant to submit additional documentation. He did not. DOHA received the \nhearing transcript (Tr.) on July 28, 2023. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant, 35, has worked for his current employer, a federal contracting \ncompany, as an information technology professional since September 2018. He was \ninitially granted access to classified information in April 2011 in connection with his \nservice in the Army Reserve from March 2011 to April 2016. He submitted his most \nrecent security application in December 3, 2018. He did not disclose any derogatory \ninformation. The background investigation revealed that Applicant owed $28,000 on \nseven delinquent debts. (GE 1, GE 5) \nApplicant blamed his financial problems on being young and immature, as well \nas a period of unemployment between March 2015 and February 2017. He incurred the \ndebt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.a in 2016. He rented a car for a friend in State 1. He claimed \nthat while his friend had possession of the car, it was stolen and found in State 2 more \nthan 300 miles away. The rental car company considered the vehicle a loss and sued \nApplicant to recover the value. In April 2019, the debtor was awarded a lien and \njudgment for $14,139.68. The debt remains unresolved. (Tr. 19-47; GE 2-6) \nThe debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.b is the deficiency balance for a repossessed car. \nHe purchased the car in 2012. He timely paid the car loan for two years before it \nbecame delinquent during a period of unemployment between March 2015 and \nFebruary 2017. After repossessing the car, the creditor sold it at auction. Following his \nmother\u2019s advice, he decided not to pay the debt and allowed the statute of limitations to \ntoll. (Tr. 20, 48-51; GE 2-6) \nThe debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.c is for a credit card. He claims to have paid the \ndebt in approximately 2018. He did not provide any proof of payment. (Tr. 20, 52-53; GE \n2-6) \nThe debt alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d and 1.e are owed to a cable company and \ncellular service provider, respectively. Applicant claimed that he tried to pay the debts \nafter discussing them during his interview with a background investigator in 2019. \nHowever, both creditors have sold the accounts to collection agencies, which Applicant \nclaimed he could not identify. (Tr. 21, 53-54; GE 2-6) \nApplicant incurred the debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.f and 1.g when he transferred his cell \nphone service from one provider to another with the understanding that the new \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nprovider would pay the cancellation fee and remaining balance with his previous \nservicer. After multiple attempts to resolve the issue with the new provider, the matter \nwas not resolved. He last attempted to resolve the issue in 2018. (Tr. 54-59; GE 2-6) \nApplicant earns $92,000 annually. He lives with his girlfriend, and they share \nliving expenses. He currently has $2,000 in savings. He did not present any evidence \nfor his plans to resolve his debt. (Tr. 16, 24) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n3 \n\n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nFailure to meet one\u2019s financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of \njudgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified \nor sensitive information. An individual who is financially overextended is at a greater risk \nof having to engage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. (AG \u00b6 \n18) The record establishes the Government\u2019s prima facie case that Applicant owed \n$28,000 in delinquent debt. The following financial considerations disqualifying \nconditions apply: \nAG \u00b6 19(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so; \nand  \nAG \u00b6 19(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations.  \nNone of the mitigating conditions apply. While Applicant may have incurred the \ndebt during a period of unemployment, he has not taken any steps to resolve the \ndelinquent accounts. \nBased on the record, Applicant is not a suitable candidate for access to classified \ninformation at this time. In reaching this conclusion, I have also considered the whole-\nperson factors at AG \u00b6 2(d). Security clearance adjudications are not debt collection \nproceedings. Rather the purpose of the adjudication is to make \u201can examination of a \nsufficient period of a person\u2019s life to make an affirmative determination that the person is \nan acceptable security risk.\u201d (AG \u00b6 2(a)) Furthermore, applicants are not held to a \nstandard of perfection. All that is required is that he develop a plan for handling his \ndelinquent accounts and executing that plan. He did not present evidence of his plans \nor efforts to resolve his delinquent accounts. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Financial Considerations:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.g: \nAgainst Applicant \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented, it is not clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant Applicant a security clearance. Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access \nto classified information is denied. \nNichole L. Noel \nAdministrative Judge \n5 \n",

(AE D) \nFinancial Considerations  \nIn his 2019 SF 86, Applicant reported that he failed to timely file his federal income \ntax returns for the tax years 2014, 2015, 2016, and 2017. The 2014 issue arose because \nhis wife was recovering from cancer surgery, and he failed to file on time and then did not \nknow how to correct the situation. The problem kept building, and he also failed to file the \nfederal income tax returns for the ensuing years. He reported that he was delinquent in \npaying $7,500 in income taxes for each of those years, but claimed he was \u201cworking with\u201d \na tax resolution company to correct the problem. He called the situation an \u201cerror in \njudgment.\u201d (GE 1 at 38-40) \nOn September 4, 2019, Applicant was interviewed by an investigator with the U.S. \nOffice of Personnel Management (OPM), and he added that after the initial year, he simply \nkept putting off filing for the current year because he was not sure how to do so after \nfailing to file for the previous year. He also corrected a statement that he had previously \nmade in his SF 86. Rather than \u201cworking with\u201d a tax resolution company to correct the \nproblem, as he had previously said, he merely contacted the company on line on one \noccasion in July 2019, but never actually hired them or made any payments to them. (GE \n2 at 5) He claimed that he had started accumulating documentation, and that he planned \nto hire \u201cthe company\u201d in the very near future. (GE at 5) \nThe SOR alleged five still-unfiled federal tax returns for the tax years 2014, 2015, \n2016, 2017, and 2018, as well as delinquent unpaid income taxes totaling approximately \n$30,000. Applicant admitted that the income tax returns had still not been filed, and he \nhad not made any payments for his unpaid income taxes. During the hearing, he also \nacknowledged that the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) prepared substitute federal \nincome tax returns for him (married but filing separate) and came up with the estimated \nunpaid income taxes. Applicant said that his actions in failing to file his federal income tax \nreturns was due to his stupidity and because he was scared to do so. (Tr. at 20-22, 38) \nWith regard to hiring the tax resolution company, Applicant acknowledged that he had not \ndone so because they wanted too much money, so he decided to stick with the IRS. (Tr. \nat 21, 45-46) He also acknowledged that when he started the security clearance eligibility \nprocess, he started realizing how seriously he had \u201cscrewed up.\u201d \nAlthough he is not on an installment agreement, Applicant claimed he periodically \nmade some payments if he has some extra money at the time, and that his outstanding \nbalance had been reduced to about $10,130. (Tr. at 22-23, 40) During the hearing, he did \nnot submit any documentation to verify payments supposedly made or the amount he \nclaimed was left outstanding. After the hearing, he submitted two Account Transcripts \nprepared by the IRS on May 3, 2022, for the tax years 2014 and 2016. A third transcript \nfor the tax year 2017 turned out to be a duplicate of the 2016 transcript.

(AE B) While the IRS acknowledged that two \nseparate amounts were transferred as credits from Applicant\u2019s 2020 federal income tax \npayments ($4,003 in April 2021 and $407 in August 2021), there were zero separate \npayments made by Applicant for the delinquent balance. (AE B) For 2016, as of May 3, \n2022, based on a substitute federal income tax return reflecting an adjusted gross income \nof $128,302 and a taxable income of $117,952, Applicant\u2019s account balance plus accruals \nwas approximately $9,824. (AE C) Despite Applicant\u2019s contentions, there were zero \npayments made by Applicant for the delinquent balance. (AE C) For those two years \nalone, his present unpaid balance is approximately $20,101. He did not address the \ndelinquent income taxes for the tax years 2015, 2017, or 2018. He claimed that his federal \nincome tax returns for the tax years after 2018 were all timely filed. (Tr. at 21-22) \nApplicant explained that when he first enlisted in the service, he lived pay day to \npay day. Now that he has approximately $18,000 or $19,000 in the bank he intends to \nkeep it as his emergency fund, instead of paying off all of his delinquent taxes. In addition, \nhis wife spends money on their grandchildren; he spends time on his 22-foot fishing boat, \nwhich cost him $63,000; and they drive two vehicles. He reported $11,193 in net monthly \nfamily income; $3,324 in monthly expenses; and $5,160 in debt payments, including \n$44,864 remaining for his boat, and a signature loan for approximately $16,855, used to \nconsolidate other bills and buy what he called \u201ctoys,\u201d leaving $2,709 as a monthly \nremainder available for savings or spending. There was no entry designated for paying \nany amounts to the IRS. (Tr. at 30-31; AE A) Regarding his \u201ctoys\u201d comment, Applicant \nnoted that he still liked his toys \u2013 including his boat and truck \u2013 and that \u201che wants his \ncake and he wants to eat it too.\u201d (Tr. at 39) \nApplicant received financial counseling \u2013 regarding the importance of having a \ngood budget \u2013 while he was in the service. (Tr. at 31, 45) He now understands the \nseriousness of the situation, and anticipated that he would lose his clearance at the \nhearing, so he spoke with someone in his office and told that person that he would \nprobably quit \u201ctoday.\u201d (Tr. at 24-25) \nPolicies \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the Executive \nBranch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security emphasizing, \n\u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d (Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. \n518, 528 (1988)) As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to control \naccess to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual \nis sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information. The President has \nauthorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant an applicant eligibility for \naccess to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to do so.\u201d (Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \nIndustry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified.) \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the guidelines in SEAD 4.

Instead, acknowledging the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. The entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known \nas the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a meaningful decision. \nIn the decision-making process, facts must be established by \u201csubstantial \nevidence.\u201d \u201cSubstantial evidence [is] such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might \naccept as adequate to support a conclusion in light of all contrary evidence in the record.\u201d  \n(ISCR Case No. 04-11463 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2006) (citing Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1))  \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d  (See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th  Cir. 1994)) \nThe Government initially has the burden of producing evidence to establish a \npotentially disqualifying condition under the Directive, and has the burden of establishing \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Once the Government has produced substantial \nevidence of a disqualifying condition, under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant has the \nburden of persuasion to present evidence in refutation, explanation, extenuation or \nmitigation, sufficient to overcome the doubts raised by the Government\u2019s case. The \nburden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government. (See ISCR \nCase No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sept. 22, 2005)) \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours as well. It is \nbecause of this special relationship that the Government must be able to repose a high \ndegree of trust and confidence in those individuals to whom it grants access to classified \ninformation. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the \napplicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. Such \ndecisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather \nthan actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Furthermore, \u201csecurity clearance \ndeterminations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d (Egan, 484 U.S. at 531) \nClearance decisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense \nbe a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d (See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 \n7) Thus, nothing in this decision should be construed to suggest that I have based this \ndecision, in whole or in part, on any express or implied determination as to Applicant\u2019s \nallegiance, loyalty, or patriotism. It is merely an indication the Applicant has or has not \nmet the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for \nissuing a clearance.  In reaching this decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that \n5 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \nare reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I \nhave avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts;  \n(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so;  \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations;  \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired. \nApplicant failed to timely file his federal income tax returns for the tax years 2014 \nthrough 2018, and for at least three of those years, the IRS prepared substitute income \ntax returns in 2019. He has never had an installment agreement with the IRS. For 2014, \nas of May 3, 2022, based on a substitute federal income tax return reflecting an adjusted \ngross income of $104,018 and a taxable income of $93,868, Applicant\u2019s account balance \nplus accruals was approximately $10,277. For 2016, as of May 3, 2022, based on a \nsubstitute federal income tax return reflecting an adjusted gross income of $128,302 and \na taxable income of $117,952, Applicant\u2019s account balance plus accruals was \napproximately $9,824. For those two years alone, his present unpaid balance is \napproximately $20,101. He did not address the delinquent income taxes for the tax years \n6 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n2015, 2017, or 2018. His reported income information seemingly negates any inability to \npay his debts, but his general attitude regarding his \u201ctoys\u201d and his emergency fund; his \nexpenditures for things other than his federal income taxes; and his payment history raise \nquestions as to an unwillingness to pay his delinquent federal income taxes. AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(b), \n19(c), and 19(f) have been established. \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns arising from financial difficulties under AG \u00b6 20: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control;  \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts;  \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue; and \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority \nto file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \nNone of the mitigating conditions apply. Applicant said that his actions in failing to \nfile his federal income tax returns was due to his stupidity and because he was scared to \ndo so after missing the initial year. When he started the security clearance eligibility \nprocess, he started realizing how seriously he had \u201cscrewed up.\u201d Although he repeatedly \nstated that he would address his income tax issues by hiring a tax resolution company, in \nfact, he never actually did so. Applicant never entered into installment agreements with \nthe IRS. His claimed periodic payments to the IRS are essentially unverified. His financial \ncounseling from many years ago was basically for budgeting. \nA debt that became delinquent several years ago is still considered recent because \n\u201can applicant\u2019s ongoing, unpaid debts evidence a continuing course of conduct and, \n7 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \ntherefore, can be viewed as recent for purposes of the Guideline F mitigating conditions.\u201d \n(ISCR Case No. 15-06532 at 3 (App. Bd.

Sept. 13, 2016)).  \nThe DOHA Appeal Board has observed: \nFailure to file tax returns suggests that an applicant has a problem with \ncomplying with well-established governmental rules and systems. Voluntary \ncompliance with such rules and systems is essential for protecting classified \ninformation. ISCR Case No. 01-05340 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 20, 2002). As we \nhave noted in the past, a clearance adjudication is not directed at collecting \ndebts. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 07-08049 at 5 (App. Bd. Jul. 22, 2008). By \nthe same token, neither is it directed toward inducing an applicant to file tax \nreturns. Rather, it is a proceeding aimed at evaluating an applicant\u2019s \njudgment and reliability. Id. A person who fails repeatedly to fulfill his or her \nlegal obligations does not demonstrate the high degree of good judgment \nand reliability required of those granted access to classified information. \nSee, e.g., ISCR Case No. 14-01894 at 5 (App. Bd.

Aug. 18, 2015). \nThe Appeal Board clarified that even in instances where an applicant has \npurportedly corrected his or her federal tax problem, and the fact that the applicant is now \nmotivated to prevent such problems in the future, does not preclude careful consideration \nof an applicant\u2019s security worthiness in light of his or her longstanding prior behavior \nevidencing irresponsibility including a failure to timely file federal income tax returns.

He has not acted responsibly by failing to more aggressively \naddress his federal tax returns and delinquent taxes. The Appeal Board has previously \ncommented on such a situation: \nEven if Applicant\u2019s financial difficulties initially arose, in whole or in part, due \nto circumstances outside his [or her] control, the Judge could still consider \nwhether Applicant has since acted in a reasonable manner when dealing \n8 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nwith those financial difficulties.

Dec. 1, 1999); ISCR Case No. 03-\n13096 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 29, 2005)). A component is whether he or she \nmaintained contact with creditors and attempted to negotiate partial \npayments to keep debts current. \nAn applicant who begins to resolve his financial problems only after being placed \non notice that his or her security clearance is in jeopardy may be lacking in the judgment \nand self-discipline to follow rules and regulations over time or when there is no immediate \nthreat to his or her own interests. (See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 17-01213 at 5 (App. Bd. Jun. \n29, 2018); ISCR Case No. 17-00569 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Sept. 18, 2018) In this instance, \nApplicant has failed to furnish sufficient verifiable evidence that he actually began making \nsuch efforts \u2013 to file federal income tax returns or pay delinquent income taxes \u2013 before \nthe SOR was issued in September 2020 \u2013 approximately one and one-half years ago. \nWhile he may have timely filed his federal income tax returns for the tax years 2019, 2020, \nand 2021, he has actually made no efforts to address the earlier years. \nClearance decisions are aimed at evaluating an applicant\u2019s judgment, reliability, \nand trustworthiness. They are not a debt-collection procedure. The guidelines do not \nrequire an applicant to establish resolution of every debt or issue alleged in the SOR. An \napplicant needs only to establish a plan to resolve financial problems and take significant \nactions to implement the plan. There is no requirement that an applicant immediately \nresolve issues or make payments on all delinquent debts simultaneously, nor is there a \nrequirement that the debts or issues alleged in an SOR be resolved first. Rather, a \nreasonable plan and concomitant conduct may provide for the payment of such debts, or \nresolution of such issues, one at a time. Mere promises to pay debts in the future, without \nfurther confirmed action, are insufficient. In this instance, Applicant offered general \nstatements regarding alleged payments, but those statements remain unverified. \nThe nature, frequency, and continued recency of Applicant\u2019s financial difficulties, \nand his general failure to voluntarily and timely start to resolve them until after the SOR \nwas issued, is sufficient to conclude that his financial difficulties were not infrequent. The \ngeneral absence of meaningful efforts to file his federal income tax returns or resolve his \ndelinquent federal tax debts is not good, and they constitute negative factors. \nThe Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a good-faith effort to \nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts: \nIn order to qualify for application of [the \u201cgood-faith\u201d mitigating condition], an \napplicant must present evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or some other good-faith action aimed at resolving the \napplicant\u2019s debts. The Directive does not define the term \u201cgood-faith.\u201d \nHowever, the Board has indicated that the concept of good-faith \u201crequires \na showing that a person acts in a way that shows reasonableness, \nprudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.\u201d  \n9 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(internal citation and footnote omitted) ISCR Case No. 02-30304 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 20, \n2004) (quoting ISCR Case No. 99-9020 at 5-6 (App. Bd. Jun. 4, 2001)). \nThere is scant recent evidence of financial counseling or a budget. Applicant\u2019s \nrelative in-action, under the circumstances, casts doubt on his current reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and good judgment. See ISCR Case No. 09-08533 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Oct. \n6, 2010). \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. Moreover, I have \nevaluated the various aspects of this case in light of the totality of the record evidence \nand have not merely performed a piecemeal analysis. See U.S. v. Bottone, 365 F.2d 389, \n392 (2d Cir. 1966); see also ISCR Case No. 03-22861 at 2-3 (App. Bd. Jun. 2, 2006). \nThere is some evidence in favor of mitigating Applicant\u2019s financial considerations. \nApplicant is a 63-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has been serving as a \nsheet metal worker with his current employer since about June 2013. He was previously \nemployed by another employer overseas as a fabrication maintenance consultant. He is \na 1977 high school graduate, and he received an associate\u2019s degree in 2000. He enlisted \nin the U.S. Air Force in July 1981, and served on active duty until July 2011, when he was \nhonorably retired as a highly decorated Chief Master Sergeant (E9). He was granted a \nsecret clearance in 2009. He was married in 1983. He has two children, born in 1985 and \n1987. \nThe disqualifying evidence under the whole-person concept is simply more \nsubstantial and compelling. Applicant failed to timely file his federal income tax returns \nover a multiple-year period (2014 through 2018) and failed to make his federal income \ntaxes during the same period. The IRS filed substitute income tax returns for him and it \nwas determined that he still owed over $30,000 in delinquent income taxes. He never \nentered into installment agreements with the IRS, and according to the IRS records in \n10 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nevidence, there is no evidence that he ever made any payments for his delinquent income \ntaxes. He acknowledged that his actions were stupid, and that he paid no attention to his \nsituation until he started preparing his SF 86 in anticipation of a security clearance \neligibility review. Although he appeared to have sufficient salary and savings to start \naddressing his federal income tax problems, he was more focused on enjoying his \u201ctoys,\u201d \nincluding his fishing boat. There is no verifiable evidence that he even made periodic or \ninconsistent payments \u2013 something he claimed to have made. Although he repeatedly \nstated that he would address his delinquent tax issues over the past few years, there is \nno evidence that he has done so.  \nThe overwhelming evidence leads to the conclusion that Applicant\u2019s financial \nproblems are not under control. He has not acted responsibly by failing to more timely \nand aggressively address his federal income tax issues. There are lingering questions if \nApplicant is currently in a better position financially than he had been, as well as \ncontinuing doubt about his current reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. \nIn ISCR Case No. 07-06482 at 2-3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008), the Appeal Board \naddressed a key element in the whole-person analysis in financial cases stating: \nIn evaluating Guideline F cases, the Board has previously noted that the \nconcept of \u201cmeaningful track record\u201d necessarily includes evidence of actual \ndebt reduction through payment of debts. However, an applicant is not \nrequired, as a matter of law, to establish that he [or she] has paid off each \nand every debt listed in the SOR. All that is required is that an applicant \ndemonstrate that he [or she] has \u201c. . . established a plan to resolve his [or \nher] financial problems and taken significant actions to implement that plan.\u201d \nThe Judge can reasonably consider the entirety of an applicant\u2019s financial \nsituation and his [or her] actions in evaluating the extent to which that \napplicant\u2019s plan for the reduction of his outstanding indebtedness is credible \nand realistic. See Directive \u00b6 E2.2(a) (\u201cAvailable, reliable information about \nthe person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, should be \nconsidered in reaching a determination.\u201d) There is no requirement that a \nplan provide for payments on all outstanding debts simultaneously. Rather, \na reasonable plan (and concomitant conduct) may provide for the payment \nof such debts one at a time. Likewise, there is no requirement that the first \ndebts actually paid in furtherance of a reasonable debt plan be the ones \nlisted in the SOR. \nApplicant\u2019s track record of minimal, if any, verifiable efforts to resolve the federal \ntax issues is negative and disappointing. Overall, the evidence leaves me with substantial \nquestions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. \nFor all of these reasons, I conclude Applicant has failed to mitigate the security concerns \narising from his financial considerations. See SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6\u00b6 2(d) (1) through AG \n2(d) (9). \n11 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                        \n         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a. through 1.e.:  \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

He was initially granted access to classified information in September 2015, in connection with his service in the Army National Guard. DOD initiated the current investigation after Applicant\u2019s employer filed an incident report in March 2018 regarding Applicant\u2019s travel to Colombia and his relationship with a Colombian national. (Tr. 29-30,33; GE 3) In early March 2018, Applicant\u2019s manager notified the company\u2019s facility security office (FSO) that Applicant failed to return to work as expected after a temporary duty assignment in another state. When asked, Applicant told the FSO that he traveled to Colombia to visit a friend, a citizen of that country. The same day the FSO filed the incident report, a counterintelligence (CI) representative from the Defense Security Service (DSS) interviewed Applicant at his place of employment. He admitted to the CI representative that he traveled to Colombia in August 2017 and February 2018. He also admitted that he was engaged to a Colombian national and he initiated the process with the U.S. State Department to sponsor her immigration to United States. He reported that he planned on returning to Colombia in April 2018 for his wedding ceremony. (GE 3; AE E) On his April 26, 2018 security clearance application, Applican",

I informed \nhim that I did not have the authority to do so but forwarded the request to Department \nCounsel.

The emails are appended to the record as Hearing Exhibit (HE) \nIX. The attachments to Applicant\u2019s emails are admitted into evidence as Applicant\u2019s \nExhibits (AE) A through C. \nGovernment\u2019s Motion to Amend the SOR \nOn January 12, 2023, the Government filed a Motion to Amend the SOR, citing \nthe development of new information relevant and material to a determination of \nApplicant\u2019s security worthiness. (See, Hearing Exhibit (HE) III) I convened the hearing \nas scheduled on January 13, 2023, to hear the parties on the Motion. DOHA received \nthe transcript of the motions hearing on January 26, 2023. (Motion Transcript at. 5-6) \nDuring the motions hearing, Applicant confirmed receipt of the motion but had not \nread it. Based on the Government\u2019s proffer, I granted the Government\u2019s Motion to \nAmend the SOR. However, in the interest of protecting Applicant\u2019s Due Process Rights, \nI continued the hearing until April 13, 2023. On January 13, 2023, I issued a combined \nruling on the Government\u2019s Motion to Amend and Case Management Order, which is \nappended to the record as Hearing Exhibit (HE) VI. The Government served Applicant \nand the Court with a finalized copy of the SOR as amended and updated disclosure \nletter on January 31, 2023, as ordered.

The \nGovernment clarified the language in SOR \u00b6 2.b to state that Applicant failed to report a \nFebruary 2018 trip to Colombia to his facility security officer (FSO), as required. He \nadmitted this allegation. The Government also added three allegations, SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.d \nthrough 2.f, under the personal conduct guideline. SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.d and 2.e are falsification \nallegations that Applicant intentionally withheld information from the Government about \nhis travel to Columbia in February 2018, and that he intentionally made false statements \nto the Government about the circumstances under which he met his then wife in 2017. \nHe denied both allegations.

He sent four emails \nbetween April 20, 2023, and April 27, 2023, containing 30 attachments related to foreign \ntravel reports he made to his employer between 2021 and 2022. The emails are \nappended to the record as HE X through XIII. \nThe first email (HE X), dated April 20, 2023, contained five attachments, one of \nwhich, a two-page foreign travel debrief, dated September 22, 2022, was admitted to \nthe record during the hearing as part of GE 8. The second email, also dated April 20, \n2023 (HE XI), contained one attachment \u2013 a spreadsheet detailing his foreign travel \nbetween July 2021 and September 2022. \nThe third email (HE XII), dated April 21, 2023, contained three zip files labeled \n2021, 2022, and Archives.

He was initially granted access to \nclassified information in September 2015, in connection with his service in the Army \nNational Guard. DOD initiated the current investigation after Applicant\u2019s employer filed \nan incident report in March 2018 regarding Applicant\u2019s travel to Colombia and his \nrelationship with a Colombian national. (Tr. 29-30,33; GE 3) \nIn early March 2018, Applicant\u2019s manager notified the company\u2019s facility security \noffice (FSO) that Applicant failed to return to work as expected after a temporary duty \nassignment in another state. When asked, Applicant told the FSO that he traveled to \nColombia to visit a friend, a citizen of that country. The same day the FSO filed the \nincident report, a counterintelligence (CI) representative from the Defense Security \nService (DSS) interviewed Applicant at his place of employment. He admitted to the CI \nrepresentative that he traveled to Colombia in August 2017 and February 2018. He also \nadmitted that he was engaged to a Colombian national and he initiated the process with \nthe U.S. State Department to sponsor her immigration to United States. He reported \nthat he planned on returning to Colombia in April 2018 for his wedding ceremony. (GE \n3; AE E) \nOn his April 26, 2018 security clearance application, Applicant disclosed his \nmarriage to a Colombian national days before he completed the application. He also \ndisclosed his wife as foreign national to whom he provided financial support. In addition \nto his wife, he also disclosed his mother-in-law, also a Colombian national, as a relative. \nHe reported traveling to Colombia in August 2017, February 2018, and April 2018. (GE \n1; AE D) \nAs part of the investigation, Applicant had two interviews with a background \ninvestigator on February 21, 2019, and March 28, 2019. During the February interview, \nApplicant told the investigator that in August 2017, he informed his supervisor that he \nwas traveling to his home country to attend a family event but changed his mind and \ntraveled to Colombia instead. He told the investigator that he that he met his wife, a \nColombian national, while walking through a shopping mall. After that meeting, he told \nthe investigator that they spent the remaining six days of his trip together. Upon \nreturning the United States, he maintained daily telephonic contact with the woman and \nstarted supporting her financially. He denied meeting the woman before the trip. (GE 2) \nWhen asked by the investigator if he reported the August 2017 trip to his FSO, \nApplicant explained that he was not aware of the requirement to do so. After marrying \nin April 2018, Applicant claimed to have shown his supervisor a picture of his wedding \nand provided his wife\u2019s information to the human resources department. He believed \nthis constituted sufficient notification to his employer of his relationship with a foreign \nnational. He told the investigator that after March 2018 interview with a DSS agent and \nreceiving additional security training on foreign travel and contact reporting \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nrequirements, that he reported two additional trips to Colombia in January 2019 and \nFebruary 2019 to his FSO as required. (GE 2) \nDuring the second interview in March 2019, the investigator asked Applicant if he \nreported his February 2018 travel to Colombia to his FSO. After claiming that he could \nnot remember doing so, he told the investigator that he did not report the trip because \nhe did not know he needed to do so. He contends that he failed to mention his failure to \nreport the trip in his first interview because it slipped his mind. (GE 2) \nThe investigator asked Applicant details about how he met his wife. He denied \nknowing his wife before his first trip in August 2017. He reiterated that he met her during \nthe trip. The investigator pressed further: \nSubject was asked could it be possible that he met his spouse before \ntraveling to Colombia. Subject responded yes. Subject was asked if he \nmet her online[.] [sic] Subject responded no. Subject was then asked if he \nmet his spouse on [dating web site]. Subject responded no.  Subject was \nasked again how he met his spouse[.][sic] Subject advised that he met her \nonline around May 2017 but did not want to disclose which site [it] [sic] \nwas, because it is his personal business. He wanted to keep some things \nprivate and to himself. Subject reluctantly stated that it was a dating site \nbut refused to provide any further details. Subject disclosed that he did not \nreport this information the first time because he was embarrassed by \nmeeting his spouse online and he did not want people to look at him \ndifferently. (GE 2) \nDOHA sent Applicant a set of interrogatories to which Applicant responded in \nMay 2020. He was asked to review and verify the summaries of the February and \nMarch 2019 subject interviews. He reported that the summaries were not accurate, \nspecifically, the details about how he met his wife. He offered the following correction: \nDue to stigmatization that \u201coh he met his wife online,\u201d I did not disclose \nthat I met my wife online first. I met my wife online in summer 2017. We \ntalked over the phone and video call for a month or so and then I visited \nher in Colombia. She met me at the airport. And that is how we started our \nrelationship. \nAside from this correction, he confirmed that the remainder of the summary was \naccurate as captured. (GE 2) \nApplicant returned to Colombia in January 2020. After receiving the SOR in \nDecember 2020, he traveled to Colombia to visit his wife in May 2021, July 2021, \nDecember 2021, and February 2022. He returned to Colombia in March 2022 to serve \nher with a divorce petition because she would not complete the necessary steps to \nimmigrate to United States. He claims that his divorce was finalized in April 2022. That \nsame month, he met another Colombian national online and returned there in \nSeptember 2022 to visit her in-person. He claims that after that visit he decided not to \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \npursue that relationship or any other with a foreign national.  (Tr. 34-36, 41-43, 96-\n97,100; AE F-G) \nAt the hearing, Applicant testified that the March 2018 incident report filed by his \nemployer also contained false statements. He denies the statements in the report that \nhe traveled to Colombia instead of reporting to work as required after completing a \ntemporary duty assignment. He also testified he told the FSO that he had traveled to \nspend time with his girlfriend whom he intended to marry, not just a friend. He claims \nthat everyone knew about his girlfriend in Colombia and that the relationship was not a \nsecret. (Tr. 94-95) \nApplicant reviewed GE 7, which contains the security training he received when \nhe started his job in April 2017 and confirmed the signature on the training record as his \nown. He testified that he was not aware of the foreign travel reporting requirements \nbecause he did not read the training materials. He also admitted receiving annual \nrefresher training on the reporting requirements. (Tr. 56-70; GE 5-9) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the AG list potentially disqualifying \nconditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an Applicant\u2019s \neligibility for access to classified information. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the \nGovernment must present evidence to establish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is responsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and \nother evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by applicant or \nproven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The applicant has the ultimate burden of \npersuasion to obtain a favorable security-y decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nof potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAnalysis \nForeign Influence \nThe SOR alleges disqualifying conduct under the foreign influence guideline. \n\u201c[F]oreign contacts and interests . . .are a national security concern . . . if they create \ncircumstances in which the individual may be manipulated or induced to help a foreign \nperson in a way that is inconsistent with U.S. interest or otherwise made vulnerable to \npressure and coercion by any foreign interest.\u201d (AG \u00b6 6) At the time the SOR was \nissued, Applicant had relationships with his then wife, mother-in-law, and a friend, who \nwere residents and citizens of Colombia. The following disqualifying conditions apply: \nAG \u00b6 7(a) contact, regardless of method, with a foreign family member, \nbusiness or professional associate, friend, or other person who is citizen \nof or resident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heighted risk of \nforeign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; and \nAG \u00b6 7(c) failure to report or fully disclose, when required, associations \nwith a foreign person, group, government, or county. \nTypically, the foreign influence analysis requires an examination of the risks \nraised by the country at issue. Here, such an analysis is not necessary. The country at \nissue here is not of particular importance, because the risk was created by Applicant\u2019s \nconduct. Applicant feared the stigma associated with online dating, so he attempted to \nhide his foreign contacts from the Government and his employer in violation of his \nduties as a clearance holder. While online dating is common, that does not mean that it \nis not without risk, especially when the relationship is with a foreign national. Applicant\u2019s \ninitial failure to report also prevented his employer from giving him proper security \nbriefings and obtaining debriefs that may have been necessary and appropriate. \nNotwithstanding Applicant\u2019s failure to report these foreign relationships, they \nhave ended and says he has no intention of pursing relationships with foreign nationals \nin the future. Although none of the specific foreign influence mitigating conditions apply, \nI conclude that concern is mitigated, and the allegation is resolved in his favor. \nPersonal Conduct \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions about an \nindividual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified information. Of \nspecial interest is any failure to cooperate or provide truthful answers during national \nsecurity investigative or adjudicative process. (AG \u00b6 15) \nThe SOR alleges that Applicant intentionally misled the Government about how \nhe met his ex-wife, a Colombia national, in two background interviews in February and \nMarch 2019, respectively. (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.a and 2.e) The SOR also alleges that Applicant \nfailed to report his February 2018 trip to Colombia to his FSO and denied that the trip \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \noccurred during a background interview in February 2019 (SOR \u00b6 2.b) The SOR alleges \nthat the Applicant continues to use websites to initiate and maintain relationships with \nwomen from Colombia (SOR \u00b6 2.f). \nA statement is false when it is made deliberately (knowingly and willfully). An \nomission of relevant and material information is not deliberate if the person genuinely \nforgot about it, inadvertently overlooked it, misunderstood the question, or genuinely \nthought the information did not need to be reported. Falsification allegations require a \nfinding regarding an applicant\u2019s state of mind when the alleged falsification occurred. \nHere, the record contains direct evidence of Applicant\u2019s intent to mislead his employer \nand the Government. \nThe record establishes that Applicant was trained on the reporting requirements \nfor foreign travel and contacts. He admitted the self-perceived stigma he believed \nassociated with online dating was his motivation for lying to both his employer and the \nGovernment and his failure to report as required. The following disqualifying conditions \napply: \nAG \u00b6 16 (a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant \nfacts from any personnel security questionnaire, personal history \nstatement, or similar form used to conduct investigations, determine \nemployment qualification, award benefits or status, determine national \nsecurity eligibility or trustworthiness, or fiduciary responsibilities; and \nAG \u00b6 16(b) deliberately providing false or misleading information; or \nconcealing or omitting information, concerning relevant facts to an \nemployer, investigator, security official, competent medical or mental \nhealth professional involved in making a recommendation relevant to \nnational security eligibility determination, or other official government \nrepresentative. \nNone of the personal conduct mitigating conditions apply. Although Applicant \neventually disclosed all his international travel and the circumstances under which he \nmet his ex-wife, he only did so after being directly confronted with the truth. Even at the \nhearing, Applicant did not present as a credible witness. He continued to cast doubt on \nhis ability to provide full and truthful disclosure to the Government on personal or \nprofessional matters. \nWhole-Person Concept \nI have also evaluated Applicant\u2019s conduct under the whole-person factors at AG \n\u00b6 2(d). Applicant failed to meet his burdens of production and persuasion to overcome \nthe negative whole-person assessment established in the record.

Her admissions are incorporated into the findings of fact. Based on my \nreview of the pleadings, evidence submitted, and testimony, I make the following \nadditional findings of fact. \nApplicant is 55 years old. She works as a truck driver. In 2021, she started taking \ncontract work from a government contactor. She was married in 2000 and has one adult \nstepchild. She earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in 1991. (Tr. 55-57; GE 1, 2) \nApplicant testified that she and her husband purchased land in 1993 and started \nbuilding their own home in 2005. Their plan was to finance the building costs through a \nconstruction mortgage, but they needed to cover some of the initial expenses. She \nclaimed that in 2007, their banker told them to use credit cards to buy supplies, and the \ncredit-card debt would be paid when the final mortgage was established. Applicant \nestimated that they put about $20,000 on credit cards. When the bank gave them a \n$250,000 construction loan in 2012, they were not given any funds to reimburse them for \ntheir past expenses. She stated that SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.e, 1.h, and 1.i were debts related to \nconstruction costs. (Tr 15-25, 55-68; GE 7) \nIn about 2011, Applicant\u2019s husband had his overtime hours reduced, and he had \ntwo surgeries in a 2012. The first surgery put him on short-term disability for five months, \nand the second surgery for three months. He had part-time jobs that earned him extra \nmoney but was unable to work them while on medical leave. Around that time, Applicant\u2019s \nwork hours were reduced for about two and a half years. She claimed they tried to keep \nup with their credit-card debts but were not able to maintain those payments and their \nother expenses. Most of the \u201cdate[s] of last activity\u201d for the credit cards were between \nNovember 2014 through February 2015. Applicant claimed that she did not have the \nfunds to pay or settle the debts. These debts remain unpaid. She stated that her last \ncontact with the creditors was in the 2014-2015 timeframe. No further action has been \ntaken. (Tr. 15-68; GE 4, 7) \nApplicant started driving a truck part time in 2018. In 2021, she and her husband \ncashed in part of their 401k accounts and purchased their own truck. She and her \nhusband drive together. They are out for three to six weeks at a time. Their yearly income \nand truck-related operating and maintenance expenses have varied greatly each year \nsince 2021. (Tr. 25-55) \nThe SOR alleges 11 delinquent debts totaling about $43,000. The status of the \nallegations is as follows: \nSOR \u00b6 1.a is a credit-card account past due for $1,368, with a total balance of \n$6,652. Applicant admitted this allegation.

The reference stated that \nApplicant was a valuable employee and a reliable and trustworthy friend, but it did not \naddress any financial-related issues. (AE C) \nPolicies \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG), which became \neffective on June 8, 2017. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in conjunction \nwith the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. The protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 \n2(b) requires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national \nsecurity eligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation of potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information).  \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds.  \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an individual might knowingly \ncompromise classified information in order to raise money. It encompasses concerns \nabout an individual\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting \nclassified information. An individual who is financially irresponsible may also be \nirresponsible, unconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified \ninformation. ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \nThe guideline notes conditions that could raise security concerns under AG \u00b6 19. \nThe following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nThe financial considerations security concerns are established by the credit reports \nand Applicant\u2019s admissions. AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a), and 19(c) apply. \nConditions that could mitigate the financial considerations security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 20.

Applicant failed to provide sufficient documentation \nshowing that any of the alleged debts are being paid, are resolved, or became delinquent \nunder such circumstances that are unlikely to recur. Her failure to pay these debts is both \nlong-term and recent, as well as ongoing and unresolved. These circumstances continue \nto cast doubt on her current reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. \nAG \u00b6 20(b) does not apply.

However, she did not establish \nthat she acted responsibly under the circumstances. \nAG \u00b6 20(d) does not apply. Applicant did not provide sufficient evidence showing \na good-faith effort to repay creditors or resolve debts, and she has not established any \nmeaningful track record of debt payments. \nAG \u00b6 20(e) does not apply.

I considered her character \nletter. I considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuidelines F in my whole-person analysis. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance.

In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in conjunction \nwith the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration.

This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation of potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nThe concern under Guideline F (Financial considerations) is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds . . . .   \nApplicant\u2019s admissions and the documentary evidence establish the following \ndisqualifying conditions under AG \u00b6 19: \n(a) Inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nAG \u00b6 20 describes conditions that could mitigate security concerns. The following \nare potentially applicable in this case: \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; and \n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or  \notherwise resolve debts; and owed and is in compliance with those\narrangements. \n \nApplicant\u2019s 2013 period of unemployment and significant reduction in pay were \ncontributing factors to his financial problems. He began working to resolve his debt at \nleast two years in advance of completing his 2019 security clearance application. The \nCBRs in the record and the letter from CRC reflect he resolved several debts prior to the \nissuance of the SOR. Additionally, he retained CRC based upon the recommendation of \nhis FSO, while working for a DOD contractor. He paid CRC, in good faith, almost $1,600 \nto \u201cresolve\u201d his delinquent debts. He has no new delinquent debts, and he has worked \npart-time jobs consulting and in the ARN to contribute additional income to his family. He \nfollows a written budget, and there are no indications he is currently living beyond his \nmeans. \nApplicant has demonstrated mitigation under AG \u00b6\u00b6 20. \nGuideline E: Personal Conduct \nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the security concern pertaining to personal conduct: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. The following will normally result in \nan unfavorable national security eligibility determination, security clearance \naction, or cancellation of further processing for national security eligibility: \n(a) refusal, or failure without reasonable cause, to undergo or \ncooperate with security processing, including but not limited \nto meeting with a security investigator for subject interview, \ncompleting security forms or releases, cooperation with \nmedical \nor \npsychological \nevaluation, \nor \npolygraph \nexamination, if authorized and required; and \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(b) refusal to provide full, frank, and truthful answers to lawful \nquestions of investigators, security officials, or other official \nrepresentatives in connection with a personnel security or \ntrustworthiness determination. \nAG \u00b6 16 describes the following condition that could raise a security concern and \nbe disqualifying in this case: \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification or relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar \nform used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, \naward \nbenefits \nor \nstatus, \ndetermine \nnational \nsecurity \neligibility \ntrustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities. \nIn this case, Applicant did not disclose any of his delinquent debts in his 2019 SCA. \nHe denied intentionally falsifying his SCA. He credibly testified he misunderstood the \nquestion to believe he was required to disclose \u201ccurrent\u201d delinquent accounts, not \naccounts that were years old. He also reasonably believed he did not have any delinquent \naccounts because he was able to obtain a sizeable mortgage believing that he could not \nhave unpaid delinquent accounts to do so. While his failure to review a credit report \nbefore completing his SCA may have been negligent, it is not indicative of a failure to \ndeceive or mislead the Government. Furthermore, he disclosed other derogatory \ninformation, which raised potential issues about his ongoing security worthiness. \nWhole-Person Concept \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the potentially \ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and circumstances \nsurrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under Guidelines F and E in my \nwhole-person analysis. Applicant\u2019s finances are no longer in question, he has no new \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n__________________________ \ndelinquent debts, and sufficient savings to prevent an overextension. Additionally, I \nconsidered his military service, awards and decorations, and letters of recommendation, \nwhich all reflect favorably upon his integrity and credibility. Overall, he has demonstrated \nthe actions of a responsible, reliable, and trustworthy person. I conclude he did meet his \nburden of proof and persuasion. He mitigated the security concerns. \nFormal Findings \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \nParagraph 1, Guideline E: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.c:\n \n \nWithdrawn \nSubparagraph 1.d: \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline F: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 2.a \u2013 2.e: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 2.f: \nWithdrawn \nSubparagraph 2.g: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nI conclude that it is clearly consistent with the national interest of the United States \nto grant or continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. Eligibility for \naccess to classified information is granted. \nCAROLINE E. HEINTZELMAN \nAdministrative Judge \n8 \n",

This psychologist, who testified at length at Applicant\u2019s \nhearing, determined that Applicant met the criteria for Other Specified Personality \nDisorder, Mixed Personality Features.

He also noted that he was unable to complete \nthe second interview due to Applicant\u2019s defensive, redundant, and non-responsive \nstatements. (TR at page 33 line 15 to page 35 line 25, and at page 55 lines 13~19.) \nThe psychologist opined that this conduct indicated a deficit in Applicant\u2019s judgment that \nmay impair his ability to safeguard classified information. (TR at page 39 line 18 to page \n42 line 15, at page 58 line 11 to page 61 line 11, and at page105 line 15 to page 107 \nline 25.) \nGuideline E \u2013 Personal Conduct \n2.a. Applicant denies that he knew he was \u201cfired\u201d from his employment in May of \n2018 for conduct identified as \u201cPoor Judgment/Policy Violation.\u201d His employer\u2019s Human \nResources (HR) department \u201cexplained\u201d to Applicant, as reiterated by his then lawyer, \nthat no \u201creason\u201d was given, just that he departed his former employment by \u201cmutual \nagreement.\u201d (TR at page 110 line 22 to page 112 line 10, and at page 117 lines 1~25.) \nOnly most recently, with the submission of the Government\u2019s exhibits, was Applicant \nmade aware that his termination was categorized as \u201cfired.\u201d (GX 2 at pages 28~32, and \nGX 3.) \n2.b. Applicant did not willfully falsify his October 2018 e-QIP when he answered, \n\u201cNo,\u201d to Section 13A \u2013 Employment Activities, as to his being \u201cfired\u201d in the last seven \nyears. (GX 1 at pages 15~16.) As noted above, Applicant thought he left his former \nemployment by mutual agreement. (TR at page 112 line 11 to page 113 line 8, and at \npage 118 line 1 to page 120 line 15.) \n2.c. Applicant did not willfully falsify his October 2018 e-QIP when he answered, \n\u201cNo,\u201d to Section 22 \u2013 Police Record (EVER)\u201d which asked whether he had \u201cEVER been \ncharged with an offense involving alcohol or drugs.\u201d In January of 1993, Applicant was \npulled over on a Naval Base for a possible DUI (driving under the influence of alcohol). \n(GX 6.) The allegation was dropped at a \u201cCaptain\u2019s Mast\u201d (an Article 15 proceeding \nunder the Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ)), as Applicant\u2019s blood/alcohol ratio \nwas within legal limits. Applicant had forgotten about this incident, that occurred more \nthan 25 years prior to him executing his e-QIP, until he was questioned about the \nincident at his psychological evaluation in June of 2022. (TR at page 120 line 18 to page \n121 line 20, at page 160 line 20 to page 163 line 2, and at page 172 line 22 to page 173 \nline 18.) \n2.d. Applicant did not willfully falsify material facts at his January 2019 Office of \nPersonnel Management (OPM) interview regarding him being pulled over on a Naval \nBase for a possible DUI. (GX 6.)

(GX 6.) The allegation was dropped at a \u201cCaptain\u2019s Mast\u201d as \nApplicant\u2019s blood/alcohol ratio was within legal limits. Applicant had forgotten about this \nincident, that occurred more than 29 years prior to his evaluation, until he was \nquestioned about the incident at his psychological evaluation. \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious \nscrutiny of a number of variables known as the whole-person concept. The \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR.

This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration \nof the possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \n*Guideline I \u2013 Psychological Conditions   \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Psychological Conditions is set \nforth at AG \u00b6 27: \nCertain emotional, mental, and personality conditions can impair \njudgment, reliability, or trustworthiness. A formal diagnosis of a disorder is \nnot required for there to be a concern under this guideline. A duly qualified \nmental health professional (e.g. clinical psychologist or psychiatrist) \nemployed by, or acceptable to and approved by the U.S. Government, \nshould be consulted when evaluating potentially disqualifying and \nmitigating information under this guideline and an opinion, including \nprognosis, should be sought. No negative inference concerning the \nstandards in this guideline may be raised solely on the basis of mental \nhealth counseling.  \nThe guideline at AG \u00b6 28 contains five conditions that could raise a security \nconcern and may be disqualifying. One condition was established: \n(b) opinion by a duly qualified mental health professional that the \nindividual has a condition that may impair judgment, stability, reliability, or \ntrustworthiness. \nApplicant has been so evaluated by a duly qualified mental health professional. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe guideline at AG \u00b6 29 contains five conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns: \n(a) the identified condition is readily controllable with treatment, and the \nindividual has demonstrated ongoing and consistent compliance with the \ntreatment plan; \n(b) the individual has voluntarily entered a counseling or treatment \nprogram for a condition that is amenable to treatment, and the individual is \ncurrently receiving counseling or treatment with a favorable prognosis by a \nduly qualified metal health professional; \n(c) recent opinion by a duly qualified mental health professional employed\nby, or acceptable to and approved by the U.S. Government that an\nindividual\u2019s previous condition is under control or in remission, and has a\nlow probability of recurrence or exacerbation; \n \n \n \n(d) the past psychological/psychiatric condition was temporary, the \nsituation has been resolved, and the individual no longer shows \nindications of emotional instability; and \n(e) there is no indication of a current problem. \nI have considered AppXs A~FF, to include Applicant\u2019s 2023 Bravo Award, (AppX \nI), his 2023 \u2013 Mid-Year Performance Review (AppX M), his commendable mid-year and \nfull-year review (AppX QQ), his letters of recommendation (AppX RR), his awards and \nceremonies (AppX SS), his Honorable Discharge from the U.S. Navy (AppX TT), his \nperformance evaluation (AppX UU), and his certificates and training (AppX VV). \nHowever, at his hearing, Applicant\u2019s unfavorable mental health evaluation was \nreaffirmed in no uncertain terms. Applicant presented no expert witness testimony or \nany mental health evaluations to rebut the personality disorder diagnosis or the \nevaluating psychologist\u2019s opinion based thereon. The evidence tending to show periods \nof good workplace judgment does not establish that there is no indication of a current \nproblem in light of the contrary, recent professional opinion of a duly qualified mental \nhealth professional that his personality disorder may impair his judgment and ability to \nsafeguard classified information. I cannot overlook this most important fact. Therefore, \nPsychological Conditions is found against Applicant. \nGuideline E - Personal Conduct \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Personal Conduct is set out in \nAG \u00b6 15: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or\nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions\nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect\n \n \n \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. The following will normally result \nin an unfavorable national security eligibility determination, security \nclearance action, or cancellation of further processing for national security \neligibility: \n(a) refusal, or failure without reasonable cause, to undergo \nor cooperate with security processing, including but not \nlimited to meeting with a security investigator for subject \ninterview, completing security forms or releases, cooperation \nwith medical or psychological evaluation, or polygraph \nexamination, if authorized and required; and \n(b) refusal to provide full, frank, and truthful answers to \nlawful questions of investigators, security officials, or other \nofficial representatives in connection with a personnel \nsecurity or trustworthiness determination. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 16. Two are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or \nsimilar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment \nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine national security \neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities; and \n(b) deliberately providing false or misleading information; or concealing or \nomitting information, concerning relevant facts to \nan employer, \ninvestigator, security official, competent medical or mental health \nprofessional involved in making a recommendation relevant to a national \nsecurity \neligibility \ndetermination, \nor \nother \nofficial \ngovernment \nrepresentative \nNeither of these apply. Applicant did not make any willful falsifications on his e-\nQIP, during his interview, or at his psychological evaluation. Personal Conduct is found \nfor Applicant. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of an applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n        \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 2(b) requires each case must be judged on its own merits. Under AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security clearance \nmust be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the \nguidelines and the whole person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant is a mature individual who \nwas recently evaluated by a Government approved, duly qualified mental health \nprofessional to have a disqualifying personality disorder. The evidence concerning \npositive aspects of his workplace performance is commendable, but insufficient to \nmitigate the resulting security concerns or establish rehabilitation. The record evidence \nindicates that this personality disorder and the resulting risks are likely to continue. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s \neligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For this reason, I conclude Applicant \nfailed to mitigate the security concerns arising from his Psychological Conditions. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline I: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 1.a: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline E: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a~g: \nFor Applicant \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_________________ \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant national security eligibility \nfor a security clearance.

He has \neleven children, four are minors, two of which live with him. He has taken college classes \nbut has not yet earned a degree. He served on active duty in the Navy from 1989-2009. \n(Tr. 17-21; GE 1) \nThe SOR alleges 15 delinquent debts totaling about $65,000, a prior security \nclearance revocation for financial reasons, and an SCA falsification. The status of the \nallegations is as follows: \nSOR \u00b6 1.a is an apartment lease account placed for collection for $666. Applicant \ndenied this allegation and claimed that it had already been paid. He stated in 2014 he \nwas terminated from his job in State B and left the lease early. He provided documentation \nshowing that he paid this debt in 2018. This debt is resolved. (Tr. 29-35, 96-101; AE C, \nV; GE 5, 6, 7) \nSOR \u00b6 1.b is an apartment lease account placed for collection for $2,129. Applicant \ndenied this allegation. He claimed that he rented the apartment for three months and \nsatisfied the lease terms. For an unknown reason, the leasing company sued him in State \nC, but he had already moved home to State A. He claimed that the court papers were \nserved to his former residence, and a final judgment was entered against him without his \nknowledge. He claimed that he was unaware of the debt until 2022, when a garnishment \norder was sent to his employer. He presented evidence showing that he was paying a \ngarnishment through his paycheck but did not provide sufficient documentation showing \nthat this was the debt being paid. The creditor listed in the court record does not match \nthe creditor listed in the SOR. This debt is unresolved. (Tr. 35-43; AE B, R; GE 7, 8) \nSOR \u00b6 1.c is an apartment lease account placed for collection for $2,308. Applicant \ndenied this allegation. He stated this lease was for his daughter\u2019s apartment while she \nattended college in State A. He cosigned as the guarantor. She terminated her lease early \nin about 2018, which created the debt. He claimed he made a settlement offer in 2020 for \n2 \n\n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n$1400 with the collection agency. He gave his daughter the money to resolve the debt \nbut could not provide documentation showing payment. This debt is unresolved. (Tr. 43-\n47; GE 6, 7, 8) \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d-1.i are student loan accounts placed for collection for $31,079. \nApplicant admitted these allegations. Some of these loans are from college classes he \ntook in 1998, and some are loans he cosigned for his son in about 2017. He claimed that \nhe made payments on his student loans until 2009 but did not provide supporting \ndocumentation. In 2022, he claimed he contacted the Department of Education (DOE) to \nset up a payment plan, but they were unable to make the arrangements because of the \nCovid-19 repayment pause. Next, his friend referred him to a student loan company who \nclaimed that they would get half his student loan balance forgiven. He suspected their \nservice was a scam, however, he signed a service agreement with them after receiving \nthe SOR. He later abandoned the effort. In about June 2023, he was told that he may be \neligible for having his loans discharged for being a disabled veteran. He corresponded \nwith a lender and was sent an application for discharge. He failed to provide sufficient \ndocumentation showing that he qualified for discharge, or that any action was taken on \nthese student loans. He also failed to explain why his son\u2019s student loans would be \ndischarged. These debts are unresolved. (Tr. 47-54 101-112 132-135; AE D, L, S, T, U, \nW; GE 5, 6, 7, 8) \nSOR \u00b6 1.j is an auto loan account that has been charged off for $1,969. Applicant \ndenied this allegation. His car was totaled in an accident in 2015. He claimed that he \nestablished a settlement amount with the lender and directed his auto insurance provider \nto pay them, and no remainder should have been left over. He provided documentation \nshowing that the settlement amount was $6,500, and the insurance provider agreed to \npay $6,213.53. He did not provide sufficient documentation showing that the rest of the \ndebt was resolved. (Tr. 54-58 113; AE E, Y; GE 5, 6, 7, 8) \nSOR \u00b6 1.k is a cellular phone account placed for collection for $2,801. Applicant \ndenied this allegation, and stated he never had an account with this service provider. He \nclaimed that he contacted them to dispute the debt 5 or 10 years ago and was told it \nwould be removed from his credit report. He did not provide documentation supporting \nthis claim. This debt is unresolved. (Tr. 58-62 113-114; GE 5) \nSOR \u00b6 1.l is a judgement for an auto insurance account in the amount of $7,304. \nApplicant admitted this debt. He was in an auto accident in 2008, and another vehicle \nwas damaged. He was not found liable for a traffic violation but was found liable for \ndamaging the other car in a civil case. He made two payments on the debt in 2014. He \nmade a payment in 2015, when he found that his driver\u2019s license was being suspended \nfor non-payment. He did not make any other payments until 2020. The record shows that \nhe resumed payments in October 2020 through March 2023. The balance on the debt in \nMarch 2023 was $10,500, which is higher than the original judgement balance. He did \nnot provide documentation showing more recent payments or that this debt has been \nsatisfied. This debt is unresolved.

Applicant denied \nthis allegation. Applicant worked in State B from 2011-2014, and again in 2018-2019. He \nasserted that although he was working and staying in State B, he was not a resident. \nWhile he had State B taxes deducted from his paycheck, he did not file income tax returns \nfor State B. Applicant and other employees at his workplace received bonuses and state \nincome tax was not deducted, which caused a tax investigation. In 2016, he was required \nto file his missing State B income tax returns, and the filings showed that he owed about \n$911 for 2014. He did not pay State B this amount, but in 2018 it was deducted from his \ntax refund. Tax records showed that he still owed $193. He provided documentation post-\nhearing showing that he paid State B the remainder in September 2020. This debt is now \nresolved. (Tr. 69-77 121-123 127-131; AE G, M, N, X; GE 2, 4, 5) \nSOR \u00b6 1.n is an auto loan account that has been charged off for $12,691. Applicant \ndenied this debt and claimed that it was resolved. The debt was for a car loan with a high \ninterest rate. A group of states sued the lender for predatory loans. He claimed that he \nwas contacted by a representative of the lender and told that he could return the car and \nthe remaining debt would be wiped out. He stated the car was returned in 2020. He had \nno documentation substantiating his claim and stated that he was not provided any \npaperwork from the lender when the car war returned. This debt is unresolved. (Tr. 80-84 \n116-117; AE Q, AA; GE 6, 7, 8) \nSOR \u00b6 1.o alleges in 2008 Applicant\u2019s clearance was revoked for financial \nconsideration security concerns. The clearance was reinstated after an appeal, and a \nwarning was provided to Applicant to maintain his finances and incur no further delinquent \ndebt. He denied this allegation and claimed that he never was informed of the outcome \nof his appeal and was not given the instructions to maintain his finances. He stated that \nhe retired about six months after initially losing his clearance and left the Navy believing \nhis clearance had remained revoked. (Tr. 21-26 93-96; GE 3) \nSOR \u00b6 2.a alleges that Applicant falsified material facts on his 2017 SCA by failing\nto report a judgement and liens entered against him in the financial delinquencies section. \nHe denied this allegation. His explanation was that he failed to understand the basic \nmeaning of the question and argued that these debts cited were not responsive to the \nquestion because he had made payments on the debts. He did report the debt in SOR \u00b6 \n1.j on the SCA. (Tr. 77-80, 117-121; GE 1) \n \nApplicant provided a monthly budget statement which shows that he has about \n$3755 left over after his routine monthly expenses.

In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in conjunction \nwith the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. The protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 \n2(b) requires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national \nsecurity eligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation of potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds.  \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an individual might knowingly \ncompromise classified information in order to raise money. It encompasses concerns \nabout an individual\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting \nclassified information. An individual who is financially irresponsible may also be \nirresponsible, unconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified \ninformation. ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \nThe guideline notes conditions that could raise security concerns under AG \u00b6 19. \nThe following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts;  \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and  \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired. \nThe financial considerations security concerns are established by the credit \nreports, the revocation documentation, tax and judgment records, and Applicant\u2019s \nadmissions. AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a), 19(c) and 19(f) apply. \nConditions that could mitigate the financial considerations security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 20. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond  \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue; and \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority \nto file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \nAG \u00b6 20(a) does not apply. Applicant failed to provide sufficient documentation \nshowing that any of the alleged debts, other than \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.m, are being paid, are \nresolved, or became delinquent under such circumstances that are unlikely to recur. His \nfailure to pay these debts is both long-term and recent, as well as ongoing and \nunresolved. This continues to cast doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, and \ngood judgment. \nAG \u00b6 20(b) does not apply. Applicant failed to provide sufficient evidence showing \nthat these debts resulted from conditions beyond his control or that he acted responsibly \nunder the circumstances. \nAG \u00b6 20(d) applies to SOR \u00b6 1.a. Applicant did not provide sufficient evidence \nshowing a good faith effort to repay creditors or resolve debts, and he has not established \nany meaningful track record of debt payments for the other debts alleged. \nAG \u00b6 20(e) does not apply. Applicant did not provide sufficient documentation to \nestablish a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of past-due debts or evidence of \nactions to resolve the issue. \nAG \u00b6 20(g) applies to SOR \u00b6 1.m. The State B tax debt was resolved in 2020. \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \nAG \u00b6 15 details the personal conduct security concern: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes\u2026 \nI have considered the disqualifying conditions under AG \u00b6 16 and the following is \npotentially applicable. \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar \n7 \n\n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n   \n \n  \n \nform used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, \naward benefits or status, determine national security eligibility or \ntrustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities. \nApplicant failed to report a judgement and liens entered against him in the financial \ndelinquencies section of his SCA. AG \u00b6 16(a) applies. \nI have considered the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 17. The following is \npotentially applicable: \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment. \nApplicant stated that he did not report the required financial information on his SCA \nbecause he failed to understand the meaning of the question. His explanation for why he \nthought the judgement and liens were not responsive demonstrated that he did not \nunderstand these financial concepts. The unique facts of the judgement and liens in this \ncase make his explanation plausible. Applicant did report some negative financial \ninformation on his SCA. AG \u00b6 17(c) applies. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the potentially \ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and circumstances \nsurrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under Guidelines F and E in my \nwhole-person analysis. \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance. He did not provide sufficient evidence to \nmitigate the security concerns under Guideline F arising out of his delinquent debts. The \nGuideline E security concern is mitigated. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.b-1.l: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.m: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.n and 1.o: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline E: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 2.a: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIt is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant a security \nclearance.

Watkins, Esq. \n02/23/2024 \nDecision \nHOGAN, Erin C., Administrative Judge: \nTrustworthiness concerns raised because of Applicant\u2019s failure to timely file state \nand federal income tax returns and delinquent federal and state tax debt are not mitigated. \nEligibility for a position of trust is denied. \nStatement of the Case \nOn October 5, 2018, Applicant completed and signed his Electronic \nQuestionnaires for Investigations Processing (e-QIP). (Government Exhibit (GE) 1) On \nDecember 15, 2021, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudication Facility (DOD \nCAF) issued a statement of reasons (SOR) to Applicant raising trustworthiness concerns \nunder Guideline F, Financial Considerations. On June 17, 2022, the DOD CAF changed \nits name to the Defense Counterintelligence and Security Agency Consolidated \nAdjudication Services (DCSA CAS). This case is adjudicated under DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG), which became \neffective on June 8, 2017. \nThe SOR detailed reasons why the DCSA CAS did not find under the Directive \nthat it is clearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant or continue a \nposition of trust for Applicant and recommended referral to an administrative judge to \ndetermine whether a position of trust should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked. \nOn December 7, 2021, Applicant responded to the SOR and requested a hearing before \n1 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n    \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \nan administrative judge. The case was assigned to me on August 8, 2023. On August 16, \n2023, DOHA issued a notice of hearing, setting the hearing for October 25, 2023. The \nhearing was held as scheduled. \nDuring the hearing, Department Counsel offered six exhibits, Government Exhibits \n(GE) 1 - 6, which were admitted without objection. Applicant offered four exhibits which \nwas admitted as Applicant Exhibit (AE) A - D, without objection. AE D contains 16 \nenclosures and consists of 269 pages. Applicant testified and called three witnesses. On \nNovember 6, 2023, DOHA received a transcript (Tr.) of the hearing. The record closed on \nthat date. \nSome details were excluded to protect Applicant\u2019s right to privacy. Specific \ninformation is available in the cited exhibits and transcript.  \nFindings of Fact \nIn Applicant\u2019s SOR response, he admitted the allegations in the SOR. His \nadmissions are accepted as findings of fact. Additional findings follow. \nApplicant is a 75-year-old contractor for a DOD agency seeking to obtain or \nmaintain a trustworthiness position. He has owned his current company since 2016. He \nhas owned a contracting business since 1995. He served on active duty in the United \nStates Air Force from 1970 to 1973, separating with an honorable discharge. He held a \nsecurity clearance in the past without incident. His highest level of education is a \nbachelor\u2019s degree. He is married but lives separately from his wife. He has adult children. \n(Tr.44-46, 87; GE 1; AE D, enclosures 5-6) \nFinancial Considerations \nThe SOR alleges Applicant failed to file his federal income tax returns for tax years \n2010 through 2018. (SOR \u00b6 1.a: GE 1 at 3 - 4; GE 2 at 4, 11); is indebted to the federal \nGovernment for delinquent taxes in the approximate amount of $223,723 for tax years \n2010 through 2016. (SOR \u00b6 1.b: GE 2 at 4, 11-12, 19-37); failed to file his State A income \ntax returns for tax years 2010, 2011, 2015, 2016, and 2017 (SOR \u00b6 1.c: GE 2 at 38); and \nis indebted to State A for delinquent taxes in the amount of $38,595 for tax years 2010, \n2011, and 2016. (SOR \u00b6 1.d: GE 2 at 2, 4, 13, 38-40). \nAdditional allegations consist of a $4,094 delinquent medical account (SOR \u00b6 1.e: \nGE 2 at 5; GE 3 at 1; GE 4 at 2; GE 5 at 2; GE 6 at 8); a $192 delinquent medical account \n(SOR \u00b6 1.f: GE 2 at 5; GE 3 at 2; GE 4 at 2; GE 5 at 2; GE 6 at 9); and a $206 delinquent \nmedical account. (SOR \u00b6 1.g: GE 2 at 6; GE 3 at 2; GE 4 at 2; GE 5 at 2; GE 6 at 8) \nApplicant and his business partner started a consulting business in 1995 \n(consulting firm #1). His business partner was responsible for the overall management of \nthe business. In other words, he did the payroll, accounting and state and federal tax \nreturns. The business partner died unexpectedly in 1997. Applicant continued to operate \nconsulting firm #1 but was not experienced with running the business operations, \n2 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \nincluding preparing and filing the state and federal tax returns for the business. As a result, \nhe neglected to file and pay the business\u2019s federal and state tax returns as well as his \npersonal federal and state tax returns beginning in 1998. (Tr. 44-49, 89-92) \nIn 2001, Applicant attended a meeting at State A, regarding filing an application \nfor a tax forgiveness/amnesty. He met CPA #1 at this meeting. She agreed to help him \nwith filing and paying his state and federal income tax returns. She also advised him on \nthe structure of his business. She also brought in a law firm and another accountant who \nwere more experienced in dealing with Applicant\u2019s issues. Applicant believes CPA #1 \nover-charged him. Over a two-year period, he paid her approximately $38,000. CPA # 1 \nonly prepared two years of federal and state income tax returns as of 2003. (Tr. 49-51, \n92, 101-102; AE D. enclosure 10 at 245) \nCPA #1 advised him to take out a second mortgage on his home in order to resolve \nhis tax debt. In 2003, Applicant saved $44,000 which he intended to pay off his tax debts. \nHowever, he lost a contract unexpectedly and needed the money to pay living expenses. \nHe was unemployed for approximately six months. He rehired CPA # 1 around 2004. She \nfiled his several years of taxes. (Tr. 50-51, 101) \nBetween 2003 and 2011, Applicant\u2019s consulting business had several contracts to \nwork on, yet he did not file and pay federal and state taxes for the business or his personal \nincome taxes. He hired CPA #2 in 2011, who helped him, but referred him to CPA #3 who \nwas more familiar with business taxes. CPA #3 referred him to a company who would do \nhis withholding, 401(k), and quarterly filings for him. Between 2001 to 2014, Applicant \nexperienced eight months without a contract and without income. This delayed his \nattempts to resolve his income taxes. (Tr. 51-52, 97, 103; AE D at 1-19) \nIn 2016, Applicant\u2019s son referred him to CPA #4. He prepared all of Applicant\u2019s \noutstanding state and federal tax returns. He remains his CPA and wrote a letter indicating \nall tax returns are now filed and they are in the process of negotiating an OIC with the \nInternal Revenue Service (IRS) with the federal tax debt. Applicant also hired a business \nto help him prepare his payroll, withholdings, and to prepare his quarterly business and \npersonal income tax returns. (Tr. 52, 98, 104; AE D, enclosure 11 at 247) \nBetween 2016 and 2019, Applicant had several serious health issues which \ndelayed his ability to file his income tax returns. In 2016, Applicant had what he thought \nwas to be routine outpatient surgery, but it became complicated when it was discovered \nhe had other issues. In 2018, he was diagnosed with cancer and received radiation and \ntherapy over the next two years. (Tr. 52, 105) \nIn 2016, Applicant shut down consulting firm # 1, and started consulting firm #2. \nCPA # 3 helped him file his late federal and state personal and business income tax \nreturns. He and his business, consulting firm #2, have timely filed and paid federal and \nstate income taxes for the past four years. He currently serves as a subcontractor to a \nprime contractor on a DOD contract. His contract expires in August 2024. He hopes to \nreceive a new contract when his contract expires. He claims that if he does not receive \nanother contract, he may have difficulty paying off the IRS.

He offered to pay $16,000 to resolve his \nfederal tax debt. (AE D, enclosure 10 at 177-245) On August 14, 2023, the IRS rejected \nthe OIC because they believed the amount offered was less than Applicant\u2019s reasonable \ncollection potential. The IRS determined he has $94,058 in net equity in assets. His net \nmonthly income is $3,973. They also estimated Applicant has a total future income of \n$353,671. As of the date of the IRS letter, the total amount of the delinquent tax debt is \n$326,872. (AE A at 1-7) Applicant is appealing the denial of the OIC because he contends \nhis future income will not be $353,671. This future income is apparently assessed at \nworking 89 months. Applicant claims this is impossible because he is 75, in poor health, \nand the unreliability of competing for and being awarded contracts. The appeal is pending. \n(Tr. \u2013 65-72; AE B) \nSOR \u00b6 1.c: Applicant failed to timely file State A\u2019s tax returns for tax years 2010, \n2011, 2015, 2016, and 2017: He filed State A\u2019s tax returns for tax years 2010, 2011 and \n2016.

(Tr. 79; AE D, Enclosure 16 at 265-267) \nUnalleged Tax Debts \nDuring the hearing, Applicant admitted he had not filed or paid federal taxes since \n1998. CPA # 1 helped him file his federal income tax returns for 1999 and 2000. CPA # \n2 helped him file his federal tax returns for tax years 2008, 2009, and 2014. (Tr. 117) His \ncurrent accountant, CPA #3, advised him that the IRS did not have his federal income tax \nrecords before 2008. In other words, they would not pursue his federal income tax issues \nbetween 1998 and 2007 because of the passage of time. (Tr. 112) \nApplicant also disclosed that he owed State B income taxes for tax years 2011, \n2012, 2013, and 2015. The total amount owed was approximately $30,000. State B \nagreed to an OIC for $17,000. In October 2022, Applicant paid $17,000 to State B. The \nstate tax debt owed to State B is resolved. (Tr. 75-77, 100, 112; AE D, enclosure 15 at \n263) \nThe failure to timely file and pay federal income taxes from 1998 to 2007 and \nfailure to timely file and pay state income taxes to State B were not alleged in the SOR. \nIn ISCR Case No. 03-20327 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, 2006) the Appeal Board listed five \ncircumstances in which conduct not alleged in an SOR may be considered stating: \n(a) to assess an applicant\u2019s credibility; (b) to evaluate an applicant\u2019s \nevidence of extenuation, mitigation, or changed circumstances; (c) to \nconsider whether an applicant has demonstrated successful rehabilitation; \n(d) to decide whether a particular provision of the Adjudicative Guidelines is \napplicable; or (e) to provide evidence for whole-person analysis under \nDirective Section 6.3. \nApplicant\u2019s non-SOR conduct will not be considered for disqualification purposes, and \nconsideration will be limited to the five circumstances outlined by the appeal board. \n5 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s gross annual income is $180,000.

He pays $1,250 a month for the condominium \nhe rents in State B. His wife lives in the residence that they both own in State A. The \nmonthly mortgage payment is $1,150. Between 2013 \u2013 2023, his gross income was \napproximately $150,000. During this time, Applicant was out of work for a total of two \nyears when he was without a contract, so his gross annual income was more like \n$130,000. His wife is a retired school teacher. Her retirement pay is $250 a month and \nwith her social security, she earns approximately $1,150 a month. (Tr. 111-112) \nApplicant has not made payments towards his federal back taxes. He is waiting for \nthe outcome of his appeal regarding the denial of his OIC to settle. He states that CPA \n#4 advised him to not make payments towards his back taxes because the payments \nwould not count as part of the OIC. Applicant was making double payments towards his \nmortgage in hopes of paying off his mortgage before he retires. (Tr. 112 -114) \nWhole-person Evidence \nMr. Z is a senior official of a DOD Agency. He has held a security clearance for \nover 20 years. He has known and worked with Applicant over 20 years. Applicant currently \nworks as a contractor for his agency. He describes his duty performance as outstanding. \nHe ranks him in the top 1% of all analysts he has worked with. He is aware of the issues \nin the SOR. He believes Applicant has good judgment. He has a unique skillset. He \nbelieves it would be a loss if he were not able to work. He recommends him for a position \nof trustworthiness. (Tr. 19-25; AE 2, Enclosure 9, at 173-174) \nColonel (Retired) P served 30 years on active duty in the U.S. Army. Applicant \nworked with him as a contractor on several projects in 2003 while Colonel P was still on \nactive duty. Applicant secured millions of dollars in funding for several projects. He \nworked hard behind the scenes to resolve the project\u2019s problems. He is aware of the \nissues related to Applicant\u2019s trustworthiness investigation. He is confident the issues with \nthe IRS will be resolved soon. He believes Applicant\u2019s long tenure as a DOD contractor \nshould be considered. (AE D, Enclosure 9 at 175-176) \nTwo of Applicant\u2019s sons testified on his behalf. His oldest son testified that \nApplicant is a good father who always provided for his family. Applicant reached out to \nhim around 2010 - 2011 regarding his tax issues and asked him for advice. He told his \nfather to hire a tax attorney and a CPA. They have discussed his father\u2019s tax problems \nfor several years. He referred his father to his personal CPA, CPA #4, who helped his \nfather with filing his delinquent tax returns. His father resolved the state tax issues and is \nworking diligently to resolve the federal tax issues through an OIC. He believes after his \nfather\u2019s business partner died, his father did not know what needed to be done on the \nbusiness side of the firm. He was also unemployed on an intermittent basis, so he \nstruggled with getting things on track. His father lives within his means. He drives a car \nthat is 20 years-old and has rented an affordable condominium over the past 12 years. \nAside from the tax issues, his father has no other issues. He is a forthright person who is \ndedicated to his career. He has always supported him.

(Tr. 36-42) \nPolicies \nThis case is adjudicated under DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial \nPersonnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended \n(Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG), which became effective on June 8, \n2017. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a public trust position, the \nadministrative judge must consider the disqualifying and mitigating conditions in the AG. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of \nhuman behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the \nadjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, \nimpartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a \nconscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d \nThe administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the \nperson, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable trustworthiness decision. \nA person who seeks access to sensitive information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nsensitive information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard sensitive information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation of potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of sensitive information. \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nAG \u00b6 18 expresses the security concern for financial considerations: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \n7 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise trustworthiness concerns \nunder AG \u00b6 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired. \nApplicant has a history of financial problems and delinquent debts primarily related \nto his state and federal taxes. He also had several delinquent medical accounts. AG \n\u00b619(c) is applicable. AG \u00b6 19(f) applies regarding Applicant\u2019s failure to file federal tax \nreturns in a timely manner for tax years 2010 through 2016; his delinquent federal tax \ndebt for tax years 2010 through 2016, an approximate total of $223,723; his failure to \ntimely file State A income tax returns for tax years 2010, 2011, 2015, 2017; and his \ndelinquent tax debt owed to State A in the approximate amount $38,595 for tax years \n2010, 2011, and 2016. \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate trustworthiness \nconcerns arising from financial difficulties. I have considered all of the mitigating \nconditions under AG \u00b6 20 and the following potentially apply: \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority \nto file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \n8 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(b) partially applies. Applicant had several periods of unemployment as a \nresult of not having a contract as well as some serious medical issues between 2016 to \n2019. While these circumstances affected Applicant\u2019s ability to resolve his tax debts, it is \ngiven less weight because I cannot conclude Applicant acted responsibly under the \ncircumstances, because he failed to timely his state and federal tax returns on multiple \noccasions beginning in 1998. While the loss of his business partner was a tragedy on \nboth a personal-level and business-level, Applicant should have been more proactive in \nlearning how the run the day-to-day business operations of consulting firm #1. Instead, \nhe neglected to timely file federal and state tax returns from 1998 to 2018. As a result, he \nincurred large tax debts to the IRS and to States A and B. While he occasionally hired \nCPAs to help him resolve his tax issues, he did not follow through to insure his federal \nand state tax issues were resolved in a timely manner. He did not act responsibly under \nthe circumstances. \nAG \u00b6 20(d) applies with respect to Applicant\u2019s resolution of the medical accounts \nalleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.e and 1.g. \nAG \u00b6 20(g) applies with respect to Applicant filing his federal and state tax returns \nas well as the resolution of his tax debts to State A and State B through OICs. It does not \napply with respect to his federal income tax debt. The IRS indicated in their August 2023 \nletter rejecting Applicant\u2019s OIC that the total amount of delinquent federal taxes owed was \n$326,872. He appealed the IRS decision, however, the federal tax debt was incurred over \na period of more than 20 years. It is unlikely to be resolved anytime soon.  \nThe DOHA Appeal Board has commented: \nFailure to file tax returns suggests that an applicant has a problem with \ncomplying with well-established governmental rules and systems. Voluntary \ncompliance with such rules and systems is essential for protecting classified \ninformation. ISCR Case No. 01-05340 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 20, 2002). As we \nhave noted in the past, a clearance adjudication is not directed at collecting \ndebts. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 07-08049 at 5 (App. Bd. Jul. 22, 2008). By \nthe same token, neither is it directed toward inducing an applicant to file tax \nreturns. Rather, it is a proceeding aimed at evaluating an applicant\u2019s \njudgment and reliability. Id. A person who fails repeatedly to fulfill his or her \nlegal obligations does not demonstrate the high degree of good judgment \nand reliability required of those granted access to classified information. \nSee, e.g., ISCR Case No. 14-01894 at 5 (App. Bd. Aug. 18, 2015).  \nThe Appeal Board clarified that even in instances where an \u201c[a]pplicant has \npurportedly corrected [his or her] federal tax problem, and the fact that [applicant] is now \nmotivated to prevent such problems in the future, does not preclude careful consideration \nof [a]pplicant\u2019s security worthiness in light of [his or her] longstanding prior behavior \nevidencing irresponsibility\u201d including a failure to timely file federal income tax returns. See \nISCR Case No. 15-01031. \n9 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n     \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \nWhile Applicant took to steps to file all of his untimely state and federal tax returns, \nhe has a lengthy history of not timely filing his federal and state income tax returns and \nof not paying his federal and state tax debts. At the close of the record, his federal tax \ndebt remains unresolved in the amount of $326,000. Overall, his past conduct raises \nquestions about his trustworthiness, judgment, and reliability. Applicant did not meet his \nburden of proof to mitigate the concerns raised under financial considerations. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), \u201c[t]he ultimate determination\u201d of whether to grant a security \nclearance \u201cmust be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines\u201d and the whole-person concept. My comments under Guideline F are \nincorporated in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were \naddressed under those guidelines but some warrant additional comment. \nI considered Applicant\u2019s honorable service in the United States Air Force, as well \nas the favorable recommendations from people whom he worked with on past and current \ncontracts. I considered the favorable testimony of his two sons as well as the support he \nprovided to his wife and children. I considered his health issues in 2016 to 2019. I \nconsidered Applicant\u2019s inaction towards his state and federal income taxes since 1998. \nHis federal tax issues are unlikely to be resolved in the near future. \nThe trustworthiness concerns raised under Financial Considerations are not \nmitigated. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:   \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 1.a: \nFor Applicant \n10 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_________________________ \nSubparagraph 1.b: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.c: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.d: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.e \u2013 1.g: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances in this case, it is not clearly consistent with the \ninterests of national security to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a trustworthiness \nposition.

(Tr. 27-83; GE 6, 10) \nThe SOR alleges 14 delinquent debts totaling $86,204, and failure to file his federal \nand state income tax returns for 2021. The status of the allegations are as follows: \nSOR \u00b6 1.a alleged a debt for child support arrears totaling $57,740. The record \nshows that Applicant actually owes $134,794. While it appears that his paycheck has \nbeen consistently garnished since March 2020, he is not meeting his obligations because \nthe balance has steadily grown about $10,000 over three years. He did not provide \ndocumentation showing his track record of payments from earlier dates. (Tr. 27-83; GE \n2, 3, 5; AE K, P) \nSOR \u00b6 1.b is an auto-loan that has been charged off for $6,545. The vehicle was \nrepossessed in about 2012, after he became separated from his first wife. He has not \ntaken any action on it and this debt is unresolved. (Tr. 51-68; GE 2, 3) \nSOR \u00b6 1.c is a credit card placed for collection for $5,043. The debt originates from \nabout 2012. He has not taken any action on it and this debt is unresolved.

In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a public trust position. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n       \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in conjunction \nwith the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. The protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 \n2(b) requires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national \nsecurity eligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.  \nA person who seeks access to sensitive information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nsensitive information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard sensitive information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation of potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of sensitive information. \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe trustworthiness concern for financial considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds.  \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an individual might knowingly \ncompromise sensitive information in order to raise money. It encompasses concerns \nabout an individual\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting \nsensitive information. An individual who is financially irresponsible may also be \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nirresponsible, unconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding sensitive \ninformation. ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise trustworthiness concerns \nunder AG \u00b6 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income tax \nreturns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as required. \nThe SOR allegations are established by the credit reports and Applicant\u2019s \nadmissions. AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a), 19(c), and 19(f) apply. \nConditions that could mitigate the financial considerations trustworthiness \nconcerns are provided under AG \u00b6 20. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay overdue\ncreditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority \nto file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \nApplicant provided sufficient evidence that he has undertaken good-faith efforts to \nresolve the two alleged student loans. AG \u00b6 20(d) applies to SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d and 1.e, and I \nfind those allegations in Applicant\u2019s favor. \nAG \u00b6 20(a) does not apply. Applicant failed to provide sufficient documentation \nshowing that any of the remaining debts are resolved, or that any became delinquent \nunder such circumstances that are unlikely to recur. His failure to pay his delinquent debts \nis both long-term and recent, as well as ongoing and unresolved. This continues to cast \ndoubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \nApplicant did not provide sufficient evidence showing that his debts or unfiled tax \nreturns occurred largely due to circumstances beyond his control or that he acted \nresponsibly under the circumstances. AG \u00b6 20(b) does not apply. \nAG \u00b6 20(g) does not apply. Applicant admitted that he failed to timely file his federal \nand state income tax returns for tax year 2021. He did not provide sufficient evidence that \nthe returns have been filed, only that the paperwork has been completed. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a public trust position by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \npublic trust position must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the potentially \ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and circumstances \nsurrounding this case. I considered his military service and character letters. I have \nincorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a public trust position. He did not provide sufficient evidence to \nmitigate the trustworthiness concerns under Guideline F arising out of his delinquent \ndebts and unfiled federal and state income tax returns. Eligibility for access to sensitive \ninformation is denied. This decision should not be construed as a determination that \nApplicant cannot or will not attain the state of reform necessary for eligibility for a public \ntrust position in the future. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.c: \nAgainst Applicant \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nSubparagraphs 1.d and 1.e: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.f \u2013 1.o: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIt is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for \na public trust position.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant, 29, has worked for his current employer, a federal contracting company since March 2020. He completed his first security clearance application on April 28, 2020. He disclosed a February 2017 termination from a large electronics retailer, reporting that he left the job by mutual agreement following charges or allegations of misconduct. He reported the allegations as being a \u201ctheft scheme.\u201d (GE 1) In response to questions about his criminal history he provided more information about the allegations: I received goods from a coworker which later turned out to be stolen, was fired along with the other workers and was arrested under charges for theft and scheme. (GE 1) Applicant began attending college and living on campus in August 2012. He financed his education with the student loans alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 3.a \u2013 3.f and 3.h \u2013 3.k. The two years he lived on campus, the proceeds from his student loans covered his tuition and living expenses. His financial problems began once he moved off campus. Even though he worked parttime and received some financial assistance from his mother, he did not have enough money to pay living expenses. In March 2014, he began working for a national electronics retailer. By January 2015 he was no longer enrolled in college. He continued to struggle to pay his living expenses and in May 2016, he was evicted from his apartment. The apartment complex obtained a judgment for the outstanding rent due.

(Tr. 69-71) \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant, 29, has worked for his current employer, a federal contracting \ncompany since March 2020. He completed his first security clearance application on \nApril 28, 2020. He disclosed a February 2017 termination from a large electronics \nretailer, reporting that he left the job by mutual agreement following charges or \nallegations of misconduct. He reported the allegations as being a \u201ctheft scheme.\u201d (GE 1) \nIn response to questions about his criminal history he provided more information about \nthe allegations: \nI received goods from a coworker which later turned out to be stolen, was \nfired along with the other workers and was arrested under charges for \ntheft and scheme. (GE 1) \nApplicant began attending college and living on campus in August 2012. He \nfinanced his education with the student loans alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 3.a \u2013 3.f and 3.h \u2013 3.k. \nThe two years he lived on campus, the proceeds from his student loans covered his \ntuition and living expenses. His financial problems began once he moved off campus. \nEven though he worked parttime and received some financial assistance from his \nmother, he did not have enough money to pay living expenses. \nIn March 2014, he began working for a national electronics retailer. By January \n2015 he was no longer enrolled in college. He continued to struggle to pay his living \nexpenses and in May 2016, he was evicted from his apartment. The apartment complex \nobtained a judgment for the outstanding rent due.

He told a coworker about his financial problems and the \ncoworker offered to help. (Tr. 18, 21-24, 46; GE 1-2) \nThe coworker gave Applicant a limited-edition gaming console, telling Applicant \nthat he was upgrading to a better system. At the time, Applicant considered the console \nto be an unexpected gift. He sold it, earning enough money to avoid eviction again. \nWhen Applicant told the coworker that he sold the console, the coworker told Applicant \nthat he expected the console to be sold. The coworker also told Applicant that he could \nhelp him earn extra money. Still experiencing financial problems, Applicant joined the \ncoworker in a theft scheme. (Tr. 46-49) \nApplicant explained the scheme in his May 2020 interview with a background \ninvestigator: \n[Coworkers] were falsifying turn[-]in in records. They would go to an empty \nworkstation (computer/register) and put in that a certain item was returned \nto the store which it never had been and the system would create a gift \ncard for the false return. The employees would then take these gift cards, \npurchase items in the store and then resell them in the private market for \ncash\u2026[Applicant] started to take some of the items bought by the false gift \ncards and resell them for cash. This took place from 12/2016 to 02/2017 \n(total of 6 weeks) once or twice a week. [Applicant] never took part in \nfalsifying the computer systems with fake returns. During this period \n[Applicant] received various gaming systems and computer parts which in \ntotal were worth an estimated $4,000 to $5,000\u2026[Applicant] was aware \nthat his actions were illegal at the time. (GE 2) \nAt the hearing, Applicant provided a different account of his involvement in the \nscheme: \nI started to see other employee[s]\u2019 conduct, conduct[ing] trade-ins with \nitems that did not exist\u2026So, I had started to indulge in that as well along \nside of them and was able to forge trade-ins in the system in order to use \nthat money to pay my rent and pay for, you know living essentials\u2026. (Tr \n20) \nSo, I would go into the system\u2026Go into the system and initiate a trade-in \nfor a high ticket item such as a TV or DSLR camera that held a high trade \nin value and then those gift cards would be issued and then there would \nbe a gift card that you used to make purchases on. So, those items never \nexisted. They were fake transactions. (Tr. 51) \nHe also admitted selling the gift cards generated by these fraudulent returns. (Tr. \n20, 44, 53) \nApplicant also explained that the coworker would keep the electronics purchased \nwith the stolen gift cards in his apartment. Initially, Applicant would help the coworker \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \ntransport illegally purchased items to the coworker\u2019s home. At some point, Applicant \nbegan keeping stolen items at his home. (Tr. 49) \nIn February 2017, Applicant was confronted by his supervisor and a corporate \nrepresentative about his participation in the theft scheme. After admitting his \nparticipation in the scheme, he was terminated and arrested for felony theft. In October \n2017, he pleaded guilty to felony theft-scheme ($10,000 to under $100,000). He was \nsentenced to 60 days in jail and ordered to pay $5,943 in restitution, which included \ninterest and fees. At the hearing, Applicant testified that during the criminal plea hearing \nhe told the judge that he only sold the stolen gift cards. (Tr. 20-21, 53; GE 3-5; AE A) \nApplicant claims to have paid over $17,000 in total restitution, with almost \n$12,000 being paid before he entered his guilty plea. He did not provide any \ncorroborating evidence. In the three years after his conviction, Applicant prioritized \npaying off his court-ordered restitution and judgment for the apartment lease. He paid \n$300 each month toward the court ordered restitution and satisfied the order in August \n2020. He paid $450 each month toward the judgment, satisfying it in March 2021. \nHowever, between 2017 and 2020, he accumulated other delinquent accounts. His 10 \nstudent loan accounts became delinquent in 2018. He testified that his wages were \ngarnished for an unspecified period to collect on the loans. (Tr. 21-22, 25, 32-33; GE 2, \n6-7, AE A-B) \nAt the time DOD issued the SOR in April 2022, Applicant\u2019s student loans were in \nadministrative forbearance under the COVID-19 payment pause implemented as part of \nthe March 2020 Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (CARES Act). \nUnder the payment pause, previously delinquent loans were considered in good \nstanding and did not require payment. In December 2022, the Department of Education \nlaunched the Fresh Start Program, a loan rehabilitation program for loans that were \ndelinquent or in default prior to March 2020. Applicant enrolled in the program on July \n28, 2023, four days before the hearing. The loans were assigned to a servicer, but the \nterms of the rehabilitation had not been established. (Tr. 24, 29, 34-36; AE C) \nIn addition to the 10 student loans, Applicant had four other consumer accounts, \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.g and 1.l \u2013 1.n, totaling $5,472, that became delinquent between 2018 and \n2020. When he completed paying the restitution and judgment, he did not redirect the \n$750 toward these debts because he had other financial priorities, like saving for a \nhouse and purchasing a car. He claims to have retained a debt consolidation/credit \nrepair service he found on social media to help him repair his finances. He paid the \nservice, which he used from August to December 2022, $495 to help him resolve his \ndelinquent accounts. The service informed him that they could not help him because the \ndebts were no longer collectible. He did not provide any documentation from the \nservice. (Tr. 33, 38-40, 61-63; GE 6-7) \nAccording to GE 6, a May 2020 credit report with information from the three \nmajor credit bureaus, the debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.g was charged off in December 2016. \nThe debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.l \u2013 1.n were reported as being in collection.

Applicant claims to have paid SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.m and 1.n \nbut did not offer any proof of payment. (Tr. 41-42; GE 6-7) \nApplicant describes his finances as comfortable and he tries to live below his \nmeans. He earns $75,000 annually. At the time of the hearing, he was living with his \nmother. He contributes $1,100 each month to the household for rent and living \nexpenses. He planned on moving in with his girlfriend. He anticipated a minimal \nincrease in living expenses. He has four credit cards, three of which have balances. The \nminimum payment is $80 for the three cards. He believed that he would be able to \nmaintain his current savings rate of $650 per month and had over $7,000 in savings. He \nreported having over $2,100 in discretionary income left over after paying his financial \nobligations each month. (Tr. 24-30) \nHe considers his past actions a failure of character. He stated that an individual \nis only able to show their true character when things are not going well. He stated that \nhe would not engage in similar conduct in the future. Applicant filed a motion to have his \nfelony conviction reduced to a misdemeanor. The disposition of the motion is unknown. \n(Tr. 45-47, 56-57; GE 1) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGovernment established a prima facie case under the criminal conduct, financial \nconsiderations, and personal conduct guidelines. Applicant failed to present sufficient \nevidence to mitigate the alleged concerns. \nCriminal Conduct \nCriminal activity creates doubt about a person\u2019s judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person\u2019s ability and \nwillingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations. Applicant\u2019s 2017 felony \nconviction for theft warrants the application of the following disqualifying condition: \nAG \u00b6 31(b) evidence (including, but not limited to, a credible allegation, an \nadmission, and matters of official record) of criminal conduct, regardless of \nwhether the individual was formally charged, prosecuted, or convicted. \nNone of the mitigating conditions apply. Applicant exploited the weaknesses in \nhis employer\u2019s inventory system for his financial gain. His inconsistent statements about \nthe extent of his involvement in the scheme show that he has not fully taken \nresponsibility for his criminal behavior. Given the severity of the underlying offense, his \nconduct is not mitigated by the passage of time, his payment of restitution, or his \npositive employment history since his felony conviction. The motive behind actions \ncontinue to reflect negatively on his current security worthiness. \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nFailure to meet one\u2019s financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of \njudgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified \nor sensitive information. An individual who is financially overextended is at a greater risk \nof having to engage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. (AG \u00b6 \n18) The record establishes the Government\u2019s prima facie case under this guideline. The \nfollowing financial considerations disqualifying conditions apply: \nAG \u00b6 19(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so;   \nAG \u00b6 19(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \nAG \u00b6 (d) deceptive or illegal financial practices such as embezzlement, \nemployee theft, check fraud, expense account fraud, mortgage fraud, filing \ndeceptive loan statements and other intentional financial breaches of trust. \nNone of the mitigating conditions apply. Financial difficulties have proven to be a \nsignificant motivating factors for espionage or attempted espionage. Applicant, in a time \nof financial difficulty, engaged in illegal activity to generate funds. Similar to the reasons \nexplained in the criminal conduct section above, his actions are not mitigated under the \nfinancial considerations concerns. Furthermore, completing the terms of his sentence \ndoes not eliminate the security significance of the underlying conduct or prevent the \nexamination of the conduct and the resulting security concerns related to his current \nfinances. \nApplicant engaged in criminal conduct with the goal of resolving his financial \nproblems; however, his actions had the opposite effect. His payment of court-ordered \nrestitution exacerbated his financial problems and resulted in the accumulation of \nadditional delinquent debt. The accumulation of these debts, 10 student loans and 4 \nconsumer accounts, were not caused by events beyond his control, but rather the his \ninability to pay the debts while he paid the restitution. As of March 2021, he had \nsatisfied the restitution order, but did not provide sufficient evidence of his efforts to \nresolve the delinquent accounts alleged in the SOR. \nDespite having the benefits provided by the CARES Act, administrative \nforbearance for his delinquent student loans and the Fresh Start Program to rehabilitate \nthem, he did not take any action on his student loans until four days before the hearing. \nHe did not provide any evidence corroborating his efforts to receive financial counseling, \nnor did he provide evidence of payment on the accounts \u00b6\u00b6 3.m and 3.n as he claimed. \nHe did not provide a sufficient reason to explain his failure to pay the four consumer \naccounts even though he maintained over $2,000 in disposable income to do so. \nPersonal Conduct \nApplicant\u2019s participation in the employer theft scheme is disqualifying under the \ncriminal conduct and financial considerations concerns. However, Applicant\u2019s \ninvolvement in the theft scheme also warrants consideration under the personal conduct \nguideline. While none of the specific disqualifying conditions apply, the conduct falls \nwithin the overall concern: \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. \nApplicant has failed to provide consistent and candid disclosures about his past \ncriminal conduct. Based his testimony at hearing, it appears that he was not truthful in \nhis statements to the judge who accepted his guilty plea. Throughout this adjudication \nprocess, he has either minimized his behavior or provided conflicting statements about \nhis level of involvement in the scheme. The record supports a negative credibility \nassessment, that Applicant has failed to mitigate. His actions cannot be considered \nminor. In a place of financial distress, he chose to act in his self-interest and exploited \nhis employer\u2019s vulnerabilities. The circumstances of his conduct continue to cast doubt \non his reliability, trustworthiness, and judgment. \nBased on the record, I have significant reservations about Applicant\u2019s security \nworthiness. In reaching this conclusion, I have also considered the whole-person factors \nat AG \u00b6 2(d). The purpose of the security clearance adjudication is to make \u201can \nexamination of a sufficient period of a person\u2019s life to make an affirmative determination \nthat the person is an acceptable security risk.\u201d (AG \u00b6 2(d)) Applicant committed a series \nof thefts against a former employer to generate funds that only stopped when he was \ncaught. He has failed to fully take responsibility for his conduct. He has not \ndemonstrated the trustworthiness and reliability required of those given access to \nclassified information. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Personal Conduct:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 1.a  \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2, Criminal Conduct:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 2.a  \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 3, Financial Considerations:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 3.a \u2013 3.o  \nAgainst Applicant \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented, it is not clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant Applicant a security clearance.

On \nAugust 10, 2021, the Department of Defense (DOD) issued a Statement of Reasons \n(SOR) to Applicant detailing security concerns under Guideline F (financial \nconsiderations) and Guideline J (criminal conduct). He responded to the SOR on January \n19, 2022, and requested a hearing before an administrative judge from the Defense Office \nof Hearings and Appeals (DOHA). The case was assigned to me on February 2, 2023. \nThe hearing was convened as scheduled on June 12, 2023. Department Counsel \nsubmitted Government Exhibits (GE) 1-7, which were admitted in evidence without \nobjection. Applicant did not submit any documentation at the hearing.

The amendment was granted without objection. (Tr. \n51) \nFindings of Fact  \nIn his answer, Applicant admitted SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.c, with explanation. His \nadmissions are incorporated into the findings of fact. After review of the pleadings, \ntestimony, and evidence submitted, I make the following additional findings of fact. \nApplicant is 33 years old. He married in 2009, and divorced in 2014. He has two \nminor children with his ex-wife. He has a third minor child with another former partner. He \ncompleted some college courses, but did not earn a degree. He served in the Navy from \n2007-2015, and received an honorable discharge. He held a security clearance while in \nthe Navy. He has worked for his current employer for three and a half years, as an \navionics technician. (Tr. 14-17; GE 1). \nApplicant started paying child support in 2014, after his divorce. He did not have \nan attorney represent him in the child support proceedings, and he was assessed with a \nmonthly amount of $2,600. He reported that this amount was not sustainable, as it was \nalmost his entire monthly paycheck while in the Navy. He stated that he initially used his \ncredit cards to help meet some of his expenses, but he quickly became unable to pay the \nfull amount of child support and meet his living expenses. He accumulated arrears for the \nsupport since he was unable to make full monthly payments. In 2015, the monthly support \namount was reduced to $1,700. (Tr. 18-21, 27-32) \nHis current monthly child support obligation is $1,400 for two of his children. In \n2022, his ex-wife asked the state child support agency to waive his arrears from the 2014-\n2015 time period. For his third child, Applicant pays some money directly to his former \npartner, and $80 is automatically withheld bi-weekly by the state child support agency. \nThe record shows that he is current with all his child support obligations. (Tr. 18-21, 27-\n32; AE A, D)  \nApplicant reported that he has had financial strains over the last year and a half, \nwhich have interfered with his ability to repay delinquent debt. He and his current partner \npurchased a house in 2021, which required numerous unexpected repairs, including the \nfoundation, roof, water heater, well pump, and water filtration system. He reported that in \nthis time period, his car was destroyed by a mechanic who made shoddy repairs, and that \nhe had to pay car rental and replacement costs. He also had back surgery and was out \nof work for three months on short term disability, where he only received a portion of his \nregular salary. (Tr. 21-22, 33-39, 45-49) \nThe SOR alleges delinquent debts totaling about $32,581, including $29,757 in \nchild support arrearages. The status of the allegations is as follows: \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.a is a debt for child support arrears to State A totaling $29,757. Applicant\u2019s \nchild support account records with State A do not show any outstanding balance for \narrears. The arrears have been resolved and Applicant is maintaining his monthly support \nobligations. (Tr. 18-21, 27-32; Answer; GE 5, 6; AE A, D, E, F) \nSOR \u00b6 1.b is a credit card that was charged off for $2,476. Applicant stated that \nhe was unable to repay this debt due to the financial strain of the last one and a half years. \nHe reported that he contacted the creditor to resolve the debt, and the creditor wanted a \nlump sum payment to resolve the debt, which he was unable to make. He claimed that \nhe was told that if he wanted to make gradual payments, they would report it negatively \nto the credit reporting agencies. He provided documentation showing that after the \nhearing, he set up an automatic payment arrangement through his bank, and made at \nleast one $100 payment to the creditor. (Tr. 21-22, 33-39, 45-49; Answer; GE 5, 6; AE A, \nG) \nSOR \u00b6 1.c is a medical debt placed for collection for $348. Applicant stated that he \nwas unaware of the debt before receiving the SOR. He claimed that this debt was paid in \nfull and provided a payment confirmation number. This debt is now resolved. (Tr. 22-23, \n26-27; Answer; GE 5, 6). \nApplicant reported that he has a monthly budget and provided a personal financial \nstatement. The statement shows that he has about $972 leftover after he pays his regular \nmonthly expenses. He also recently started receiving disability benefits from his military \nservice. He provided documentation showing that he has a payment plan established to \npay a small medical debt from his recent surgery. (Tr. 43-44; AE B, H) \nPolicies \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG), which became \neffective on June 8, 2017. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in conjunction \nwith the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.  \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation of potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information).  \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds.  \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations.  \nThe SOR allegations are established by the credit reports and Applicant\u2019s \nadmissions. AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and (c) apply. \nConditions that could mitigate the financial considerations security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 20. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; and \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nApplicant\u2019s child support obligations are being paid and he has resolved the \narrears. He acted in a reliable and trustworthy manner to adjust his child support \nobligation and to resolve the arrears. He has taken appropriate action on the other two \ndebts alleged in the SOR by making payments on his charged-off credit card debt, and \nby resolving the medical debt. He has also made arrangements to pay a recent delinquent \ndebt that was not alleged in the SOR. The security concerning behavior is unlikely to recur \nand does not cast doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. He \nprovided sufficient evidence to show that he has undertaken good-faith efforts to repay \nhis creditors and resolve his debts. Applicant is not required to show that he has paid or \nresolved all of his debts, or that he has done so in any particular way. He has a reasonable \nplan to resolve his remaining delinquent debt and has implemented it. AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a), (b), \nand (d) apply. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n____________________________ \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the potentially \ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and circumstances \nsurrounding this case. I considered his military service. I have incorporated my comments \nunder Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance. I conclude that Applicant mitigated the \nfinancial considerations security concerns \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.c: \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline J: \nWithdrawn \nConclusion \nI conclude that it is clearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance is granted. \nRoss D. Hyams \nAdministrative Judge \n6 \n",

    "summary": "Findings of Fact In Applicant\u2019s answer to the SOR, she admitted SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b, 1.c, 1.e, and 1.h, all with explanations. She denied SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.d, 1.f, and 1.g, also with explanations. Her admissions are accepted as findings of fact. Additional findings follow. Applicant is 46 years old. She has never married and has no children. She earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in 2000 and a master\u2019s degree in 2009. She has worked as a DOD contractor, for various employers, since March 2001, with some periods of unemployment and work stoppage. She has held a clearance since at least 2009. She was unemployed for six months from January to June 2012 due to the end of a contract with contractor S. Under that contract, she held a salary of about $98,000. She was unemployed again in early 2018 for about three months before beginning with contractor G, since renamed contractor F, in July 2018, with annual income of about $60,000. She has worked for them ever since, and she has been working remotely since September 2019. (Tr. 9, 22-37, 43- 47, 80-83, 96-98; GE 1) Applicant also experienced periods of work stoppage, from October 2021 to December 2021, and January 15 to April 24, 2022. During this time, she earned no income, but was able to receive some unemployment benefits. In July 2022, her job was reduced to 20 hours a week. Since early October 2023, her job has been reduced to 10 hours a week. She believes she earns $37 to $38 an hour, which would be less than $400 a month. The job is her only sour",

She provided sufficient evidence to mitigate the resulting security \nconcern under Guideline F (financial considerations). Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to \nclassified information is granted. \nStatement of the Case \nApplicant submitted a security clearance application (SCA) on April 22, 2020, in \nconnection with her employment in the defense industry. On April 5, 2022, the \nDepartment of Defense (DOD) Consolidated Adjudications Facility, now known as the \nDefense Counterintelligence and Security Agency Consolidated Adjudication Services \n(CAS), issued Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security concerns under \nGuideline F.

(Answer) \nThe case was assigned to me on June 1, 2023. \nThe case was initially set for hearing on August 15, 2023, but was then postponed \nuntil September 20, 2023, at Applicant\u2019s request, for health reasons. The day before the \nrescheduled hearing date, she requested and received another postponement on similar \ngrounds. The hearing was then rescheduled for October 26, 2023, to occur by video-\nteleconference. \nThe hearing convened as scheduled. Department Counsel offered documents that \nI marked as Government\u2019s Exhibits (GE) 1 through 5. Applicant testified but did not submit \nany exhibits. At the end of the hearing, I held the record open until November 22, 2023, \nto provide Applicant the opportunity to submit additional information. Applicant timely \nsubmitted two reference letters (Applicant\u2019s Exhibits (AE) A and B) and excerpts from her \nbank statements (AE C), which were admitted without objection. DOHA received the \nhearing transcript (Tr.) on November 6, 2023. \nFindings of Fact \nIn Applicant\u2019s answer to the SOR, she admitted SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b, 1.c, 1.e, and 1.h, all \nwith explanations. She denied SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.d, 1.f, and 1.g, also with explanations. Her \nadmissions are accepted as findings of fact. Additional findings follow. \nApplicant is 46 years old. She has never married and has no children. She earned \na bachelor\u2019s degree in 2000 and a master\u2019s degree in 2009. She has worked as a DOD \ncontractor, for various employers, since March 2001, with some periods of unemployment \nand work stoppage. She has held a clearance since at least 2009. She was unemployed \nfor six months from January to June 2012 due to the end of a contract with contractor S. \nUnder that contract, she held a salary of about $98,000. She was unemployed again in \nearly 2018 for about three months before beginning with contractor G, since renamed \ncontractor F, in July 2018, with annual income of about $60,000. She has worked for them \never since, and she has been working remotely since September 2019. (Tr. 9, 22-37, 43-\n47, 80-83, 96-98; GE 1)  \nApplicant also experienced periods of work stoppage, from October 2021 to \nDecember 2021, and January 15 to April 24, 2022. During this time, she earned no \nincome, but was able to receive some unemployment benefits. In July 2022, her job was \nreduced to 20 hours a week. Since early October 2023, her job has been reduced to 10 \nhours a week. She believes she earns $37 to $38 an hour, which would be less than $400 \na month. The job is her only source of income. (Tr. 22, 27-32, 36-37, 43, 80-83, 96-99) \nApplicant\u2019s debts include two repossessed cars and some other, smaller debts. \nShe disclosed several debts on her SCA and discussed them in her May 2020 \nbackground interview They are established by credit reports from May 2020, August \n2020, and June 2022.

At the time, she was \nnot able to address the auto debts (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b). She believes those debts were \ncancelled by the creditors with the issuance of an IRS form 1099-C but she never received \nconfirmation. (Tr. 53-55) \nSOR \u00b6 1.b ($12,758) is the balance due on a repossessed vehicle placed for \ncollection. (GE 3 at 13, Acct. # 45988) Applicant admitted the debt but denies the amount \nowed. She purchased the vehicle in 2015 for about $19,000. She made payments until \nthe car broke down in July 2017. She attempted to trade the vehicle in for another working \nvehicle, but she was not able to do so. Out of necessity, she took out another loan in 2017 \n(SOR \u00b6 1.a) to purchase a replacement vehicle, leaving her with two car payments.. She \nstopped paying on the loan at SOR \u00b6 1.b in 2017 and had the car voluntarily repossessed. \nIn about October 2017, the account was charged off by the creditor. (GE 3 at 13; GE 2 at \n2; Tr. 47-52, 92-93) A June 2022 credit report reflects that this account (Acct. # 45988) \nwas charged off, for $21,994, but also that the account was paid for less than the full \nbalance. It is reflected as a \u201cPaid Charge Off\u201d and no balance is due. (GE 5 at 13) \nSOR \u00b6 1.a ($14,637) is an account placed for collection. (GE 3 at 12, GE 4) This \ndebt concerns the vehicle Applicant purchased while attempting to trade in her previous \nvehicle (SOR \u00b6 1.b). The amount alleged is the balance due after the vehicle was sold at \nauction. She purchased the car in 2017 for about $34,000 and fell behind on payments in \nSeptember 2018 due to a significant reduction in income. She said she tried to refinance \nthis loan with a lower interest rate but was not able to do so. The car was voluntarily \nrepossessed in July 2019. She said she paid the account off in January 2022, with a \nlump-sum payment on a debit card for between $8,000 and $10,000. She believes the \nremaining amount may have been canceled by the creditor. (Answer; Tr. 55-59, 85-87, \n92-95) After the hearing, she also documented a $6,000 payment towards this debt that \noccurred in February 2022. (AE C) This account is not listed on her June 2022 credit \nreport. (GE 5) \nSOR \u00b6 1.c ($1,367) is a credit account placed for collection. Applicant admitted the \naccount but said a portion had been paid off and the remainder was disputed. At her \nhearing, she disputed the account, and said she did not take out the payday loan at issue. \nShe also said she attempted to resolve it by paying it off. (Tr. 60-64) After the hearing, \nshe documented a $448 payment towards this debt in January 2022. (AE C) \nSOR \u00b6 1.d ($1,043) is a medical debt placed for collection. (GE 3 at 13) This was \nfor an emergency room visit when Applicant had no insurance during a period of \nunemployment in 2018. She said the account was paid off in January 2022, with a debit \ncard. (Tr. 64-66) \nSOR \u00b6 1.e ($693) is a cell phone account placed for collection. Applicant was made \naware of this debt during her background interview. She admitted the debt and said she \ntried several times to pay it off by phone between 2020 and 2022 but was unable to do \nso due to a language barrier between herself and the creditor\u2019s representative.

(Answer) She incurred \nthis debt when she was injured while stepping off of a boat in spring of 2018, a time when \nshe was unemployed and without insurance. She believes the debt was paid in late 2020. \n(Tr. 72-75, 85) \nSOR \u00b6 1.g ($185) is a medical account placed for collection. Applicant denies the \ndebt, asserting that she paid it off in January 2022. (Answer, Tr. 76-77) She documented \nthis payment after the hearing. (AE C) \nSOR \u00b6 1.h ($70) is a past-due debt reported for collection. Applicant admits the \ndebt but says she is unsure who to pay. (Answer; Tr. 77-78) \nApplicant\u2019s post-hearing documentation includes excerpts from bank statements \nin January and February 2022, some of which are cited above. There are also some \npayments by check card, for $898 and $735, which may also concern other SOR debts \n(such as SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d and 1.e), though this is not entirely clear. (AE C) \nApplicant said her debts were due to lack of income, decreased salary and \nunemployment. She denied living or spending beyond her means. All of her SOR debts \nwere caused months after the purchases were made, when she fell behind on her \naccounts due to unemployment. (Tr. 16, 22, 33, 79) \nApplicant was also the victim of an assault in 2021 and was badly injured. She had \nother health issues in 2023 but they did not impact her debts as she now has private \nhealth insurance. She also had a flood in her home in early 2023 that destroyed some of \nthe documentation she might otherwise have presented. (Tr. 83-88) \nApplicant has followed a budget since late 2020 but has not participated in credit \ncounseling. Now, before she buys something, she considers whether she can afford it if \nshe found herself unemployed. (Tr. 39-43, 81-82) A June 2022 credit report shows less \nthan $2,000 in collection accounts, mostly medical debts. Applicant owes just under \n$50,000 in federal student loans. At the time of the hearing no payment was due, as the \nstudent loans were in deferment due to the pandemic. She intends to address them \nthrough an income contingent repayment plan. She is current on her state and federal \nincome tax requirements. (Tr. 89-92) She loves her job and is trying to pay what she can. \n(Tr. 96, 101; GE 5) \nTwo references provided strong recommendation letters vouching for Applicant\u2019s \ncharacter and worthiness to hold a clearance. Applicant\u2019s direct supervisor attests that \nshe is a highly professional and trustworthy individual. She routinely works with sensitive \ninformation and upholds the highest standards of security and compliance with rules and \nregulations. She has a strong pride in her work and an excellent work ethic.

As the \nSupreme Court has held, \u201cthe clearly consistent standard indicates that security \ndeterminations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Department of the Navy \nv. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988). \nThe adjudicative guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in conjunction \nwith the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. The protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 \n2(b) requires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\u201d  \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for financial considerations is set out, \nin relevant part, in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. . . .  \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an individual might knowingly \ncompromise classified information in order to raise money. It encompasses concerns \nabout an individual\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting \nclassified information. An individual who is financially irresponsible may also be \nirresponsible, unconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified \ninformation. ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations.  \nApplicant incurred debts, including two repossessions and other delinquencies, \nduring previous periods of unemployment and diminished income. AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and 19(c) \napply. \nThe following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; and \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nApplicant incurred delinquent debts several years ago. Twice, she had cars \nvoluntarily repossessed. One car broke down and she tried to trade it in for another but \nwas unsuccessful. The second car that she then purchased out of necessity was also \nrepossessed after she fell behind on payments in 2018 during a period of unemployment. \nShe documented good-faith efforts to resolve both debts as she was able. Both debts are \nnow either resolved or likely resolved. Applicant\u2019s other SOR debts, by comparison, are \nquite small, and she documented efforts to pay most of them as well. These are also \nmostly medical debts, incurred due to circumstances beyond her control. The most recent \ncredit report in the record, from June 2022, shows very little debt in collection status, and \nmost of them are also medical debts.

She has also had other difficult circumstances, such as injuries and \ndepleted income, that have impacted her financial well-being. Her largest debts were \nincurred several years ago and her more recent credit report shows improved financial \ncircumstances. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(a), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the potentially \ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and circumstances \nsurrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-\nperson analysis. Applicant provided sufficient evidence to mitigate the security concern \nshown by her delinquent debts. Overall, the record evidence leaves me without questions \nor doubts as to her eligibility for a security clearance. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.h:  \nFor Applicant \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented, it is clearly consistent with the \ninterests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for access to classified \ninformation.

Based on my review of the \npleadings, evidence submitted, and testimony, I make the following findings of fact. \nApplicant is 36 years old. He has never been married. He has one minor child. He \nhas worked for a defense contractor as a power production specialist since 2021. He \ngraduated from high school in 2005. He served on active duty with the Air Force from \n2005-2009 and received a general discharge under honorable conditions. He has \npossessed a security clearance since 2005. (Tr. 18-20; GE 1, 2) \nWhile working for a defense contractor at a U.S. military facility in Country A, \nApplicated used a popular dating app to meet women. In February 2018, he met a 22-\nyear-old woman from Country B on the dating app. She told him that she and her 17-year-\nold friend were coming to Country A for work and they were looking for a place to rent a \nroom. He volunteered that he had a room that they could rent and provided her pictures \nof his apartment. She told him that he needed to talk to their \u201cboss\u201d about having them \nstay with him. (Tr. 20-48; GE 3, 5) \n \nApplicant was unaware that his interactions on the dating app were with a Naval \nCriminal Investigative Service (NCIS) undercover agent investigating human trafficking \nand prostitution in Country A. He claimed that his understanding was that the two women \nwere going to be working as waitresses. However, investigation records show that \nApplicant understood that these women were coming to Country A to work as prostitutes. \nThe records reveal that he wanted rent money and oral sex if the women stayed with him. \n(Tr. 20-48; GE 3, 5) \nA few days after conversing with the woman, a meeting was arranged with their \nboss, who was an NCIS undercover asset. A meeting location near the Navy base was \nrecommended, but Applicant suggested a place further away. He claimed that he wanted \na more distant meeting location because he did not want to fraternize with military \npersonnel, not because he had anything to hide. (Tr. 20-48; GE 3) \nApplicant\u2019s meeting was recorded and transcribed by NCIS and is in the record. \nHe was told that the boss brings women from Country B to work in Country A for \nprostitution. Country B is a well-known location for sex tourism. He was told that the two \nwomen coming were the 22 year old with whom he had already met on the dating app, \nand a beautiful 17-year-old girl. Applicant repeated his offer for them to rent a room in his \napartment. Applicant was asked to hold their passports, and make sure that that they stay \nin Country A to make money and repay their travel expenses. He was told that on paper, \nthey would work for a restaurant, but in reality, they would be prostitutes. He was told that \nhe could \u201ctest the product\u201d. Applicant stated that he was interested in the money. They \nagreed the girls would come on Friday when Applicant was not working, and Applicant \nwould pick them up from the airport.

He did \nnot show up to the airport to pick up the women. Shortly after, he sent a text message to \nthe boss to apologize and told him that he had a work conflict on that day. He inquired \nabout the status of the women and made arrangements to meet with the boss again and \npick up the women. Although the second meeting did not occur, surveillance footage \nshowed that Applicant went to the arranged meeting point. (Tr. 20-48; GE 3, 5) \nA few days after these events, Applicant was asked to meet with NCIS. He was \ntold that they were investigating the boss and that he may have been a victim of a crime. \nHe was cooperative and provided information. He claimed not to know the second \nwoman\u2019s age. He told NCIS that he was not told the women were prostitutes, but he came \nto suspect it during his meeting with the boss. He let them review his phone for the \ninvestigation, but after turning it over, they provided him with a search warrant. Over six \nmonths, NCIS conducted a forensic examination of the phone, the dating app, and a \nmessaging app. The data showed that he was told that these women were prostitutes, \nand the likely amount of income they would make working as prostitutes five days a week. \nHe was told in writing that the second woman was 17 years old. Data from the phone also \nrevealed that on other occasions he discussed paying for sex acts with four other women, \nwhich were unrelated to these events. (Tr. 20-48; GE 3, 5; AE B) \nAlthough this case was investigated pursuant to attempted violations of 18 U.S.C. \nsection \u00a71591 (Sex trafficking of children or by force, fraud, or coercion), the U.S \nDepartment of Justice ultimately decided not to prosecute this case under the Military \nExtraterritorial Jurisdiction Act. However, a decision was made to bar Applicant from all \nmilitary installations in Country A over this incident. (GE 3; AE A, C) \nIn a September 24, 2020 sworn interview about the incident with a government \ninvestigator, which applicant signed as true under the penalty of perjury, he stated that \nthere was no mention of the women being prostitutes or underage. At the hearing, he \nclaimed that he made these false statements because he forgot the details two years \nlater. (Tr. 20-48; GE 5) \nApplicant submitted three character letters and copy of his request to the U.S. \nmilitary to remove the debarment order, which contained false factual information. \nApplicant testified that he had mandatory DoD human trafficking training prior to this \nincident. (Tr. 43-44; AE G, H) \nThe SOR alleges the following: \n\u00b6 1.a alleges that in February 2018 Applicant agreed to harbor two nationals of \nCountry B, one being 17 years old, trafficked to Country A for the purpose of engaging in \nprostitution, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a71591. \n\u00b6 2.a alleges that in February 2018 Applicant agreed, in exchange for money, to \nprovide lodging to two women, including a 17 year old, whom he believed were being \ntrafficked to Country A from Country B for prostitution. \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\u00b6 2.b alleges that in May 2018, Applicant was barred from military installations in \nCountry A for the conduct alleged in \u00b6 2.a. \n\u00b6 2.c alleges that Applicant falsified material facts in a sworn affidavit with a \ngovernment investigator on September 24, 2020 by stating that there was no mention of \nthe women from Country B being prostitutes or underage. \nPolicies \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG), which became \neffective on June 8, 2017. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in conjunction \nwith the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. The protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 \n2(b) requires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national \nsecurity eligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation of potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n4 \n\n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n      \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct  \nAG \u00b6 30 expresses the security concern for criminal conduct: \nCriminal activity creates doubt about a person's judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person's ability or \nwillingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under AG \u00b6 31. \nThe following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) a pattern of minor offenses, any one of which on its own would be \nunlikely to affect a national security eligibility decision, but which in \ncombination cast doubt on the individual's judgment, reliability, or \ntrustworthiness; and  \n(b) evidence (including, but not limited to, a credible allegation, an \nadmission, and matters of official record) of criminal conduct, regardless of \nwhether the individual was formally charged, prosecuted, or convicted. \nPost hearing, the parties made arguments about application of the trafficking \nstatute alleged under Guideline J. In Hearing Exhibit (HE) 2, Applicant argued that 18 \nU.S.C. \u00a71591 (Sex trafficking of children or by force, fraud, or coercion) or the statute \nprohibiting prostitution or solicitation (25 CFR \u00a7 11.453) does not apply in this case \nbecause Applicant\u2019s focus was on helping the women find a place to stay, and not \nengaging in illicit or illegal activities. He asserts that his behavior was altruistic and limited \nto a standard rental agreement, and he had no knowledge of illicit or illegal activities they \nwould be committing. In HE 3, Department Counsel argued Applicant negotiated for sex \nacts as part of the payment for housing women that he that knew were going to engage \nin prostitution, one being under 18 years old, and he took several substantial steps in \nfurtherance of this act. \nThe investigation records in evidence (GE 3) do not support Applicant\u2019s assertion \nthat he was simply being altruistic, this was a standard rental agreement, and that he had \nno knowledge of illegal or illicit activities. Applicant\u2019s version of events are not credible. In \nthis case, Applicant\u2019s acts fall under 18 U.S.C. \u00a71349 \u2013 Attempt and Conspiracy: \nAny person who attempts or conspires to commit an offense under this \nchapter shall be subject to the same penalties as those prescribed for the \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \noffense, the commission of which was the object of the attempt or \nconspiracy.   \nThe allegations in \u00b6 1.a are established by the investigation records, Applicant\u2019s \ntestimony, and the sworn statement. AG \u00b6\u00b6 31 (a) and (b) apply. \nI have considered the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 32. The following are \npotentially applicable: \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur and \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; and \n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including, but not limited to, \nthe passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, restitution, \ncompliance with the terms of parole or probation, job training or higher \neducation, good employment record, or constructive community involvement. \nAG \u00b6 32(a) does not apply. Applicant continues to maintain a false narrative about \nthe incident. The record showed that Applicant had corresponded on other occasions with \nwomen about paying for sex acts. There is insufficient evidence to find there is mitigation \nby the passage of time, that it is unlikely to recur, and does not cast doubt on his reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and good judgment. \nAG \u00b6 32(d) does not apply. Applicant did not provide sufficient evidence to find that \nthere has been successful rehabilitation, mitigation by the passage of time, or good \nemployment record, job training, or constructive community involvement that mitigates \nthe criminal conduct concerns. Other factors are not applicable. \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \nAG \u00b6 15 details the personal conduct security concern: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information.

The allegation in \u00b6\u00b6 2.a, 2.b, and 2.c are established by the \ninvestigation records, Applicant\u2019s testimony, and the sworn statement. AG \u00b6\u00b6 16 (b) and \n(e) apply.  \nI have considered the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 17. The following are \npotentially applicable: \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; and \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, \nunreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to \nrecur. \nAG \u00b6 17(c) does not apply. The attempted offense was not minor and was criminal \nin nature. Applicant lied about material facts in a sworn statement in September 2020, \nand he continues to maintain a false narrative about the incident. He version of events \nand reason why he provided false information in the sworn interview with a government \ninvestigator are not credible. There is insufficient evidence to find there is mitigation by \nthe passage of time, the behavior is infrequent, or it happened under such unique \ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on his reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and good judgment. \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 17(d) does not apply.

He did not provide sufficient evidence to find that \nsuch behavior is unlikely to recur. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the potentially \ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and circumstances \nsurrounding this case. I considered his military service and character letters. I have \nincorporated my comments under Guidelines J and E in my whole-person analysis. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance. He did not mitigate the security concerns \nunder Guidelines J and E. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline J: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a:  \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline E: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 2.a-2.c: \nAgainst Applicant \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nConclusion \nIt is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant a security \nclearance.

He reported \nconsuming some alcohol while playing pool. He claimed that he had a couple of drinks to \nloosen up, and then switched to soft drinks for the rest of the evening. (Tr. 37-49) \nApplicant reported that his father was an alcoholic and introduced him to \nirresponsible drinking at 14 years old. After his first two Driving Under the Influence (DUI) \narrests in 2008, he attended alcohol and substance abuse education classes in 2009 but \nhas not attended substance abuse counseling or treatment. In these classes, he learned \nabout responsible drinking and how long to wait before driving after consuming alcohol. \nHe stated that he adopted the formula that if he was drinking in the evening, he would not \ndrive until the next day. He stated that he abstained from alcohol for about a year and a \nhalf, until his DUI cases were adjudicated in 2010. He reported in his background \ninterview with a government investigator, that he started drinking again in 2011 and by \n2016, he had resumed drinking three to four times a week, with six to eight mixed drinks \none or two nights on weekends. He reported that his use of alcohol increased during \nperiods he was playing pool, and it decreased during periods he had long commutes to \nwork. (Tr. 32, 49-55; GE 2) \nThe SOR alleges under Guideline G seven alcohol related arrests, including three \nDUI arrests. The status of the allegations is as follows: \nSOR \u00b6 1.a: In November 2005, Applicant was arrested and charged with minor \npossession/purchase liquor. Applicant reported that he lived in a college dorm that was \nsupposed to be alcohol free. He claimed that when alcohol was found in a common area, \nall of the residents were charged with minor in possession of alcohol. He asserted that it \nwas not his alcohol. He stated that he was dismissed from the dorm and put under \nprobation by the school. He asserts that the officer did not show up and the case was \ndismissed. He also appealed his case with the college and was allowed to return to the \ndorm.

He testified that in October 2008, \nhe had been drinking while playing pool on the night that he was arrested for DUI. He \nstated that he was surprised that the few drinks that he had consumed put him over the \nlegal limit. He was pulled over for speeding and was given a breathalyzer test. He reports \nthat he blew a .087 on the breathalyzer, and the legal limit was .08. He claimed that he \nabstained from drinking alcohol after this DUI arrest, his second in 2008, until the DUI \ncases were adjudicated in 2010, and that he drank soft drinks while playing pool. For this \ncase, he pled guilty to a reckless driving charge, and was sentenced to two weeks of jail \ntime with work release, a fine, a 90-day license suspension, and six months of \nunsupervised probation. In 2009, he attended six alcohol education and awareness \nsessions for alcohol abuse, before the case was adjudicated. (Tr. 31-32, 37-49; Answer; \nGE 2, 3) \nSOR \u00b6 1.c: In February 2010, Applicant was arrested and charged with DUI. \nApplicant stated that this occurred in August 2008, and the case was tried in February \n2010. He admits being at a bar and drinking until about 12:30 AM, then driving home \nbefore his arrest at 2:15 AM. He claims that he did not feel impaired. He stated that he \ntook a breathalyzer and blew a .12, which is well above the legal limit of .08, but he \nclaimed that the breathalyzer was not properly calibrated. He was eventually convicted of \nDUI. He appealed the case claiming that the police officer falsified the justification for \ntraffic stop in the arrest report, which called into question the legality of the traffic stop, \nand that the case was dismissed for this reason on appeal. (Tr. 24-28, 37-55; Answer; \nGE 2, 3) \nSOR \u00b6 1.e: In September 2016, Applicant was arrested and charged with \ndisorderly intoxication in a public place. He reported that he went to a social event at a \nbar with his wife and coworkers. He stated that he knew that he was going to be drinking \na lot, so he arranged for a coworker to be their designated driver. He claimed that this \nwas the first time that he let loose since his two DUIs in 2008. Some of his coworkers \nchallenged him to play pool for money. He claimed that his coworkers were adding alcohol \nto his drinks, and he thought that he had consumed less alcohol than they had given him. \nHe became so intoxicated that he was cutoff by the bar and asked to leave the premises. \nThe designated driver had been unexpectedly drinking, so his coworkers called him a \ntaxi. He testified that he had purchased a new car and did not want to leave it in the bar \nparking lot. He reported that he felt personally wronged and became enraged at the \nperson who was supposed to drive him home, and at the coworkers who physically tried \nto get him in the taxi. The police were called, and he was belligerent with the police, which \nled to his arrest. He plead nolo contendere, and paid a fine, but his sentence was \nsuspended. He claimed that he drank less after this incident but did not fully abstain from \nalcohol. (Tr. 55-61; Answer; GE 2, 3) \nSOR \u00b6 1.f: In July 2017, Applicant was transported by the police to the hospital for \nalcohol overdose, alcohol intoxication.

He reported that they had planned to walk to a restaurant \ndown the street and spend a few hours there until he was sober enough to drive home. \nHe stated that the bar was busy and service was slow, and because of this poor service \nhe did not want to tip the bar staff. He claimed this led to a confrontation with the bartender \nand the bouncer, and the police were called. The police concluded that he was so \nintoxicated that he was a danger to himself and transported him to the hospital. The \nhospital released him about three hours later, after his Blood Alcohol Content (BAC) \nimproved to .09. He claimed that after this incident, he stopped drinking, going to bars, \nand playing pool. He asserted that he did this through will power alone and did not seek \nor receive substance abuse treatment or counseling. (Tr. 61-70, 84-85; Answer; AE E; \nGE 2, 4, 5) \nSOR \u00b6 1.g: In May 2021, Applicant was arrested and charged with DUI. When \nApplicant and his wife separated in 2020, he started playing pool again. He reported that \nhe would have one or two drinks while playing to be social. On the night of this incident, \nhe reported having a few beers over the course of about six hours. He then arranged to \nmeet a woman from a dating app at another bar located about an hour away. He drove \nto the second bar and arrived at midnight. He consumed at least three additional drinks \nat this bar in under two hours. He reported feeling intoxicated after leaving the bar at \nabout 2:00 AM. He stayed on the couch of someone he met at the bar, until he believed \nhe was sober enough to drive home. He reported that he left to drive home at about 6:00 \nAM. He stated that he was driving on a dark country highway at 65 MPH, and a deer \njumped out in front of him causing him to crash into a tree. A witness to the accident told \npolice that he was passed out in the car after the crash. The police treated the case as a \nDUI. Although he requested a blood test, he was given a breathalyzer test. He reported \nthat the breathalyzer showed a BAC of .19. He denied that he was intoxicated when he \ndrove home. He stated that because this was his second DUI, his attorney told him to \nexpect a substantial jail sentence, which would have great consequences in his personal \nand professional life. He asserted that he had no choice but to take a plea agreement. He \npled guilty and received a ten-day jail sentence, and was required to complete four online \nsessions of a DUI panel, 11 sessions of state mandated substance abuse education \nclasses, 50 hours of community service, and had his driver\u2019s license suspended for six \nmonths. (Tr. 71-81, 85; Answer; AE A, B) \nApplicant reports that after his last DUI conviction, he decided that he would not \ndrive until the next day after drinking.

(Tr. 104-107) \nPolicies \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG), which became \neffective on June 8, 2017. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in conjunction \nwith the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence.

The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation of potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline G, Alcohol Consumption \nAG \u00b6 21 details the personal conduct security concern: \nExcessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable \njudgment or the failure to control impulses, and can raise questions about \nan individual's reliability and trustworthiness. \nI have considered the disqualifying conditions for alcohol consumption under AG \n\u00b6 22 and the following is potentially applicable: \n(a) alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while under \nthe influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or other \nincidents of concern, regardless of the frequency of the individual's alcohol \nuse or whether the individual has been diagnosed with alcohol use disorder. \nApplicant was cited or arrested for seven alcohol-related incidents since 2005 \nincluding three incidents from September 2016 to May 2021. AG \u00b6 22(a) applies. \nI have considered the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 23. The following are \npotentially applicable: \n(a) so much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or \njudgment; and  \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her pattern of maladaptive alcohol \nuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and has \ndemonstrated a clear and established pattern of modified consumption or \nabstinence in accordance with treatment recommendations. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 23(a) applies to SOR \u00b6 1.a. The remaining alcohol related incidents \nreflect a recurring pattern of questionable judgment, and unreliable or \nuntrustworthy behavior. I cannot find that this behavior is infrequent or unlikely to \nrecur. \nAG \u00b6 23(b) does not apply. Despite Applicant\u2019s claims that in 2009 he \nlearned about alcohol abuse and how to avoid DUIs and alcohol related incidents, \nhe continued to engage in troubling behavior involving alcohol and including his \nDUI arrest and subsequent guilty plea in 2021. He claimed to stop drinking on \nseveral occasions to avoid further trouble. However, he started drinking again and \nwould be involved in situations where his exercised questionable judgment, which \nresulted in police involvement. Applicant portrays himself as the victim in most of \nthe incidents alleged. However, his repeated minimization of his responsibility for \nhis own decisions and actions, and attempts to blame others are neither credible \nnor indicative of actions necessary to overcome his alcohol problems. In every \nalcohol-related incident, except SOR \u00b6 1.a, he admitted drinking, including \ninstances when he intended to get intoxicated, and reported that he had a BAC \nabove the legal limit to drive. \nApplicant did not provide sufficient evidence to find that he has taken \nsatisfactory actions to overcome his maladaptive use of alcohol or demonstrated \na clear pattern of modified consumption. Despite the alcohol education classes he \ntook after his last DUI, he continues to drink alcohol, and has not sought alcohol \ncounseling or treatment. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the potentially \ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and circumstances \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n____________________________ \nsurrounding this case.

I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guideline G in my whole-person analysis. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s \neligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude that Applicant has not \nmitigated the alcohol consumption security concerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline G: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.b-1.g: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIt is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant a security \nclearance.

(Hearing Transcript (Tr.) 16) I \nmarked Department Counsel\u2019s discovery letter, SOR amendment, and exhibit list as \nHearing Exhibits (HE) I, II, and III, respectively. Government Exhibits (GE) 1 through 9 \nwere admitted without objection. Department Counsel requested I take administrative \nnotice of the following: (1) 22 [State] ADMIN.

She was also a victim of sexual abuse between the ages of 12 and \n17.

(Tr. 48-49) \nLPC testified that children who are sexually abused do not generally report their \nabuse until they are adults and out of the environment in which they were being abused. \nShe also testified that a common behavior she has seen in individuals who were \nsexually abused as children is self-harm. She acknowledged that a child could engage \nin self-harm for various reasons, to include exposure to the parents\u2019 contentious \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nmarriage and divorce, and that a child could also self-harm even with loving parents. \n(Tr. 34-36, 47-48, 58-59) \nLPC recalled she began treating V for adjustment disorder, with anxiety and \ndepression, when V was self-harming as a teenager in high school. She could not recall \nthe exact date when their counseling began because her treatment records for V were \ndestroyed in a 2019 office flood, but she believed it would have been between 1999 and \n2001, when V was between the ages of 15 and 17. She recalled seeing V on a weekly \nbasis, either in the spring of V\u2019s sophomore year or early junior year in high school and \ncontinuing until V graduated from high school. She testified she knew of Applicant\u2019s \nfamily before she began counseling V, as she had previously attended the same church \nand potentially served as the Sunday school teacher for one or several of their other \nchildren, but she did not personally know them. V\u2019s mother was referred to her, for \ncounseling for V, by a fellow church member, and LPC primarily dealt with V\u2019s mother, \nand not Applicant, when V was struggling with depression, anxiety, and self-harm. (Tr. \n37-38, 49-50, 53, 55-66, 68-74) \nIn approximately the fall of 2001, LPC assessed V when V\u2019s mother brought V in \nto LPC\u2019s office after V had significantly self-harmed. LPC deemed V suicidal and had \nher hospitalized. During her hospitalization, V reported to hospital staff that she had \nbeen abused by Applicant. V had not previously reported the abuse to LPC. CPS and \nthe police were subsequently contacted, an investigation was initiated, and LPC served \nas the aftercare outpatient provider to help V work through the trauma from the alleged \nabuse. (Tr. 38-39, 45, 50, 55-58, 60, 68-87; GE 2, 7) \nLPC testified that through counseling, \u201cit ended up coming out that [V] was being \nmolested by her father, skin to skin fondled.\u201d (Tr. 38) LPC testified that V reported \nApplicant began sexually abusing V when V was a young child, but V did not have a \nclear recollection of when it started. LPC further testified that V did not report that \nApplicant sexually abused V during the period in which he was permitted visitation. After \nseveral months of working with V, LPC diagnosed V with PTSD, based on Applicant\u2019s \nabuse of V. LPC testified she was unaware of the findings made by any other entities \nthat investigated the abuse allegations against Applicant, but V has never given her any \nreason to doubt her reports that Applicant sexually abused her. (Tr. 38-39, 45, 50, 55-\n60, 63-64, 68-87; GE 2, 7) \nFrom approximately 2003 to September 2004, LPC was ordered by a county A \ncourt to provide quarterly reports about the status of her therapy with V, and V\u2019s three \nyounger siblings, for the purpose of determining whether Applicant could be \nreintegrated into his children\u2019s lives. She stated reintegration between V and Applicant \ndid not occur during this period and she recalled the ruling by county A court that \nApplicant could not have any contact with his then-minor children until they reached age \n18, and only if the children pursued the contact. (Tr. 38-39, 45, 50, 55-60, 63-64, 68-87; \nGE 2, 7) \nLPC continued to counsel V once every couple of weeks for about one year after \nV graduated from high school, \u201cuntil eventually [V] got married and started doing life.\u201d \n10 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(Tr. 65-66). She then did not see V for about seven to eight years but resumed seeing V \nin approximately 2011, and she saw V about 12 times up through as recently as two \nweeks before the hearing date. She testified that her counseling with V generally \noccurred one to two times per year when V would experience bouts of depression or \nsuicidal ideation around the same periods in the year when her reported abuse by \nApplicant happened. LPC stated that since 2011, V was hospitalized in a psychiatric \nhospital for self-destructive behavior or the desire to kill herself at least four to five \ntimes, with the last hospitalization occurring in the fall of 2019. (Tr. 40-45, 49-50, 53, 66-\n68, 73-76, 88-94) \nDuring V\u2019s last hospitalization in the fall of 2019, LPC received discharge \npaperwork revealing that in addition to continuing to list V\u2019s PTSD diagnosis, the \nhospital practitioners also diagnosed V with bipolar disorder. LPC could not recall \nwhether the paperwork reflected that V\u2019s bipolar diagnosis was with or without psychotic \nfeatures, which \u201cmeans [V] sees or hears things, sometimes it\u2019s related to the trauma.\u201d \n(Tr. 74) LPC testified that in her counseling with V, V has never relayed that she hears \nor sees things that were not actually there. LPC testified that V has said that \n\u201csometimes she feels like someone\u2019s touching her and that she is being molested or \nabused.\u201d LPC referred to V\u2019s experience as \u201cbody memories,\u201d which she stated is \ncommon among sexual abuse survivors. (Tr. 93-95) LPC testified that V\u2019s bipolar \ndisorder does not impact V\u2019s reliability or trustworthiness, but it does impact her mood \nand ability to function. (Tr. 40-45, 49-50, 53, 66-68, 73-76, 88-94) \nDr. X, Fellow of the American Psychiatric Association (FAPA), was hired by \nApplicant\u2019s then-attorney when Applicant was charged in 2001 with indecent liberties \nwith child in county B, to evaluate Applicant for the purpose of determining whether he \nfit the profile of a sex offender. He concluded, in his July 2002 report of evaluation, that \n\u201cit is very unlikely that [Applicant] is a sex offender who would have performed the acts \nof which he is charged.\u201d He noted in his evaluation that it took V approximately three \nyears, while maintaining frequent visitation with Applicant, to make the complaint of \nsexual abuse against Applicant; there was no evidence Applicant abused V other than \nher own statements to that effect; all the charges of sexual abuse and addiction \ngenerated by Applicant\u2019s ex-spouse occurred after their separation; and, in each case, \nthe complaints made by Applicant\u2019s ex-spouse dated from years before they were \nmade. (AE L) \nApplicant\u2019s eldest child, his 41-year-old son, testified. He speaks with Applicant \napproximately once every one or two months, and stated he is close to Applicant. He \ndoes not work due to his physical disabilities, and Applicant takes him to his medical \nappointments but does not provide him with financial support. He testified he was \nunaware of the allegations made by his mother against Applicant, but he was aware of \nV\u2019s allegations. He stated V did not confide in him in 1998 about her allegations that \ntheir father sexually abused her. He also stated he heard V tell his ex-wife several years \nbefore the hearing that Applicant did not do what V alleged he did. (Tr. 216-217, 241, \n253-266) He further stated: \n11 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nSo before any allegations were made, my mother, after every single visit \nwith my father, would take us kids to her room and drill us for anything she \ncould use.

She never specified what he \ndid, but she would then go, did he touch you inappropriately? Did he do \nthese things? It\u2019s very important that you remember that he did that . \nNever forget - - (Tr. 259-260) \nApplicant characterized his previous marriage as plagued with conflict due to his \nthen-spouse\u2019s domineering personality and her displeasure with his military career \naffecting his ability to assist with caring for their children. He attributed her misconduct \nallegations against him while he was in the U.S. military primarily to her attempt to \nprevent him from having custody and visitation rights over their children during their \ncontentious divorce. He stated V\u2019s sexual abuse allegations against him stemmed from \nhis ex-spouse, who used it as a means of leveraging the children against him in their \nongoing divorce and custody battle. He has never been accused of sexual misconduct \nby anyone other than his ex-spouse and V. (Tr. 151-161, 169, 187-190, 240; GE 8; AE \nH, K, L, O, P) \nGuideline E (falsification) \nApplicant maintained he has never lied on a U.S. Government background \ninvestigation form. (Tr. 181-187, 189-190, 242) He stated he did not consult with anyone \nto determine if any of his court martial charges or the indecent liberties with child by \ncustodian charge was a felony. (Tr. 217-219) He knew he had to complete the \nquestions on his SCA truthfully, and that his responses would be assessed to determine \nhis security worthiness. (Tr. 223-228) \nAs previously discussed, Applicant maintained he did not know he had been \ncharged with rape in 1998. He maintained that although he knew he was being \ninvestigated for allegations of rape made by his then-spouse, he did not see the charge \nsheet until after that and her other misconduct allegations, to wit: sodomy, conduct \nunbecoming an officer and gentleman, and indecent acts, had been lined out, leaving \nonly the charges involving his consensual relationship with a woman who was not his \nthen-spouse while he was still married. He denied knowing he had been charged with \nrape and the other misconduct allegations before they were lined out on the charge \nsheet. He also maintained there was no discussion between him and his JAG attorney \nabout whether the charges involving his consensual relationship with a woman who was \nnot his then-spouse were misdemeanors or felonies. He acknowledged having the \ncharge sheet before completing his SCA in 2020. (Tr. 165-169, 172, 186, 219, 226, 233-\n236, 240-241, 246)  \nApplicant acknowledged he knew the rape charge was a felony, despite \nmaintaining he did not know he had been charged with rape. (Tr. 219, 226, 240-241) \nThe following exchange occurred between Applicant\u2019s counsel and Applicant: \n12 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n[Applicant\u2019s counsel]: Did your lawyer ever explain to you the difference \nbetween misdemeanors and felonies, or anything like that? \n[Applicant]: Never mentioned at all.

If I may? \n[Applicant\u2019s counsel]: Yes. \n[Applicant]: That rape would be a felony, but that was dismissed. \n[Applicant\u2019s counsel]: Why \u2013 \n[Applicant]: But that was my speculation. \n[Applicant\u2019s counsel]: What was speculation? The felony or the dismissed \npart? \n[Applicant]: The felony part. (Tr .172) \n \n \nApplicant also testified he was unaware that his November 2001 charge for \nindecent liberties with child by custodian was a felony. He stated he first became aware \nthat this charge was a felony when he saw it listed as such in the FBI report he received \nfrom Department Counsel in discovery. As previously discussed, he stated the arrest \nwarrant did not reflect the charge was a felony. He also stated that although he \nunderstood the severity of the charge, he considered it to be less than a felony because \nsimilar allegations previously made by V in October 2001 in county A were determined \nto be unfounded. He also stated that at no point before the charge was nolle prossed \ndid anyone, to include his then-attorney, inform him the charge was a felony. He \nacknowledged knowing he could go to jail for more than one year if convicted of \nengaging in indecent liberties with his child. (Tr. 175-176, 186-187, 219-223, 226-227, \n237-239, 241-243; GE 3) He stated his then-attorney used the term \u201cwobbler:\u201d \nMy understanding of it was, there\u2019s a \u2013 its classification was that, upon \nconviction, the judge has a procedure to determine whether it\u2019s a \nmisdemeanor or a felony. (Tr. 219)  \nApplicant indicated during his September 2020 background interview that he \nunintentionally did not list his 2001 felony charge for indecent liberties with child by \ncustodian because he did not remember to list it. He also indicated he interpreted the \nquestion as requiring him to list incidents in the previous 7 years. When he adopted the \nsummary of his 2020 background interview in January 2022, he did not provide any \ncorrections or additions. He did not state, as he did at the hearing, that he was unaware \nthe indecent liberties with child by custodian charge was a felony. (Tr. 227-232; GE 8) \nApplicant provided numerous character references who attested to his \ntrustworthiness, good judgment, and reliability. (Tr. 247-253, 266-284) Among them \nwere five individuals who testified at the hearing, to include a friend of 13 years, two \nfellow volunteers, the son of his partner (who referred to himself as Applicant\u2019s \n\u201cfunctional stepson,\u201d) and his brother-in-law. His partner, and cohabitant of nearly 12 \nyears, also wrote that she has entrusted Applicant with her children, and he has been a \npositive role model and caretaker for them.

(Tr. 190-192; AE \nP, Q, R) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of Exec. Or. 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms \nof the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also Exec. Or. 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple \nprerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information). \n14 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAnalysis \nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct  \nAG \u00b6 30 expresses the security concern pertaining to criminal conduct: \nCriminal activity creates doubt about a person\u2019s judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person\u2019s ability \nor willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations. \nAG \u00b6 31 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. I considered the following relevant: \n(b) evidence (including, but not limited to, a credible allegation, an \nadmission, and matters of official record) of criminal conduct, regardless of \nwhether the individual was formally charged, prosecuted, or convicted.  \nIn May 1998, court-martial charges were preferred against Applicant alleging he \ncommitted rape, forcible sodomy, conduct unbecoming an officer and gentleman, and \nindecent acts against his then-spouse. In July 1998, charges alleging sodomy, conduct \nunbecoming an officer and gentleman, and indecent acts against his then-spouse were \nreferred to a general court-martial. In December 1998, Applicant was found guilty at an \nArticle 15 NJP hearing of two specifications of conduct unbecoming an officer and \ngentleman and one specification of indecent acts with a woman not his then-spouse \nwhile he was still married. He received a punitive letter of reprimand and forfeiture of \n$2,000 pay per month for two months, all but $750 per month of which was suspended \nfor six months. In April 1999, a BOI substantiated the misconduct for which he was \nfound guilty and he was consequently involuntarily discharged from the U.S. military in \nOctober 1999 under general under honorable conditions for unacceptable conduct. In \nNovember 2001, Applicant was arrested and charged with felony indecent liberties with \nchild by custodian. AG \u00b6 31(b) is established. \nI have considered all of the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 32 and considered \nthe following relevant: \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur \nand does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or \ngood judgment;  \n(c) no reliable evidence to support that the individual committed the \noffense; and  \n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including, but not limited \nto, the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, restitution, \ncompliance with the terms of parole or probation, job training or higher \neducation, \ngood \nemployment \nrecord, \nor \nconstructive \ncommunity \ninvolvement. \n15 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 32(c) applies to the May 1998 court-martial charges preferred against \nApplicant and the July 1998 charges referred to a general court-martial that were \nultimately withdrawn. AG \u00b6\u00b6 32(a) and 32(d) apply to the charges of conduct \nunbecoming an officer and gentleman and indecent acts, involving a woman who was \nnot Applicant\u2019s then-spouse while he was still married, for which Applicant was found \nguilty at NJP in December 1998. Nearly 26 years have passed since Applicant\u2019s 1998 \nconviction, for which he was involuntarily discharged from the U.S. military under \nhonorable conditions after a BOI substantiated the misconduct for which he was found \nguilty. His conduct also happened under such unusual circumstances in that it occurred \nwhile he was a captain in the U.S. military and going through a contentious divorce and \ncustody battle. He has not since engaged in similar conduct, and such conduct is \nunlikely to recur, and does not cast doubt on his reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment. I find SOR \u00b6 1.b for Applicant. \nAG \u00b6 32(c) applies to Applicant\u2019s November 2001 charge of felony indecent \nliberties with child by custodian. Applicant maintained at hearing, as he did during his \ninterview with the detective in December 2001, that he never sexually abused V. \nDespite the hearing testimony of V and LPC, that charge was nolle prossed. In addition, \nV\u2019s testimony was contradicted by the testimony of her older brother, who testified he \nheard V tell his then-spouse that Applicant did not do what she alleged he did. Further, \nV\u2019s similar allegations against Applicant in a different county were determined by that \ncounty to be unfounded. I find SOR \u00b6 1.a for Applicant. \nGuideline D, Sexual Behavior \nAG \u00b6 12 expresses the security concern pertaining to sexual behavior: \nSexual behavior that involves a criminal offense; reflects a lack of \njudgment or discretion; or may subject the individual to undue influence of \ncoercion, exploitation, or duress. These issues, together or individually, \nmay \nraise \nquestions \nabout \nan \nindividual\u2019s \njudgment, \nreliability, \ntrustworthiness, and ability to protect classified or sensitive information. \nSexual behavior includes conduct occurring in person or via audio, visual, \nelectronic, or written transmission. No adverse inference concerning the \nstandards in this Guideline may be raised solely on the basis of the sexual \norientation of the individual. \nAG \u00b6 13 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. I considered the following relevant: \n(a) sexual behavior of a criminal nature, whether or not the individual has  \nbeen prosecuted; and \n(d) sexual behavior of a public nature or that reflects lack of discretion or \njudgment. \n16 \n\n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAs stated above in my analysis under Guideline J, court-martial charges involving \ncriminal sexual behavior on Applicant\u2019s part against his then-spouse were preferred and \nreferred to a general court-martial in 1998. Applicant was also found guilty at an Article \n15 NJP hearing in 1998 of engaging in sexual conduct of a public nature and reflective \nof a lack of discretion and judgment, with a woman who was not his then-spouse while \nhe was still married. He was also charged with felony indecent liberties with child by \ncustodian in 2001. AG \u00b6\u00b6 13(a) and 13(d) are established. \nI have considered all of the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 14 and considered \nthe following relevant: \n(b) the sexual behavior happened so long ago, so infrequently, or under \nsuch unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or judgment. \nFor the same reasons as set forth above in my Guideline J analysis, AG \u00b6 14(b) \napplies and I find SOR \u00b6 2.a for Applicant. \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct  \nThe security concern for personal conduct is set out in AG \u00b6 15: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. . . . \nThe guideline notes conditions that could raise security concerns under AG \u00b6 16. \nThe disqualifying conditions potentially applicable in this case include: \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or \nsimilar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment \nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine national security \neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities; and \n(c) credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is \nnot sufficient for an adverse determination under any other single \nguideline, but which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-\nperson \nassessment \nof \nquestionable \njudgment, \nuntrustworthiness, \nunreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and \nregulations, or other characteristics indicating that the individual may not \nproperly safeguard classified or sensitive information. \nAG \u00b6 16(a) applies to Applicant\u2019s deliberate failure to list his 2001 felony charge \nfor indecent liberties with child by custodian on his 2020 SCA. He provided inconsistent \nexplanations at the hearing and during his adopted 2020 background interview for why \n17 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nhe did not list this charge. He testified that although he understood the severity of the \ncharge, he was unaware it was a felony because the arrest warrant did not identify it as \nsuch, similar allegations previously made by V in a different county were determined to \nbe unfounded, his then-attorney never informed him the charge was a felony and led \nhim to believe the charge\u2019s classification would be determined only upon conviction, and \nhe did not learn of its felony classification until he saw it in the FBI report. Yet, nowhere \nduring his September 2020 background interview or in his January 2022 adoption of the \nreport of that background interview did he state such. To the contrary, he indicated that \nhe did not remember to list it and he interpreted the question as requiring him to only list \nincidents from the previous 7 years. Moreover, I do not find it credible that an individual \nof Applicant\u2019s educational and professional pedigree would be unaware, at the time he \ncompleted his SCA, that a charge of indecent liberties with child by custodian would be \nanything less than a felony. \nAG \u00b6 16(a) also applies to Applicant\u2019s deliberate failure to list his court-martial \ncharge of rape preferred against him in May 1998 on his 2020 SCA. Despite Applicant\u2019s \nposition that he did not know he had been charged with rape in 1998, he knew he was \nbeing investigated for allegations of rape made by his then-spouse, he admitted seeing \na charge sheet in which the rape allegations had been lined out, and he acknowledged \nknowing that a charge of rape was a felony. Again, I do not find it credible that an \nindividual of Applicant\u2019s educational and professional pedigree would be unaware, at \nthe time he completed his SCA, that he had to list the rape charge in response to a \nquestion inquiring whether he had ever been charged with a felony. \nAG \u00b6 16(a) does not apply to Applicant\u2019s failure to list his court-martial charges of \nsodomy, conduct unbecoming an officer and gentleman, and indecent acts, as alleged \nin SOR \u00b6 3.a. Although the record evidence, as discussed above, demonstrates \nApplicant knew he was charged with rape, which is a felony, it does not establish that \nhe knew that the other misconduct allegations, to wit: sodomy, conduct unbecoming an \nofficer and gentleman, and indecent acts, were felonies. I therefore find that part of SOR \n\u00b6 3.a for Applicant. \nFor the same reasons as set forth above in my Guideline J analysis, AG \u00b6 16(c) \napplies to SOR \u00b6 3.b, which cross alleges the information set forth in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and \n1.b. \nAG \u00b6 17 provides the following conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns: \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; \n(b) the refusal or failure to cooperate, omission, or concealment was \ncaused or significantly contributed to by advice of legal counsel or of a \nperson with professional responsibilities for advising or instructing the \nindividual specifically concerning security processes. Upon being made \n18 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \naware of the requirement to cooperate or provide the information, the \nindividual cooperated fully and truthfully; \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, \nunreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely \nto recur; and \n(f) the information was unsubstantiated or from a source of questionable \nreliability.  \nFor the same reasons as set forth above in my Guideline J analysis, AG \u00b6 17(f) \napplies to SOR \u00b6 3.b, which cross alleges the information set forth in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and \n1.b. \nHowever, none of these mitigating conditions are established for SOR \u00b6 3.a. \nApplicant did not make prompt, good-faith efforts to correct his falsifications on his \n2020 SCA before being confronted. His concealments were not caused or significantly \ncontributed to by advice of legal counsel or of a person with professional responsibilities \nfor advising or instructing him specifically concerning security processes. His deliberate \nfalsifications on his 2020 SCA are not minor offenses. Instead, these omissions strike at \nthe heart of the security clearance process, which relies on candid and honest reporting. \nApplicant has not taken accountability for his deliberate falsifications. As such, he has \nnot shown that his behavior was infrequent, happened under unique circumstances, or \nis unlikely to recur. I find against Applicant on the part of SOR \u00b6 3.a that alleges he \ndeliberately failed to list on his 2020 SCA his 2001 felony charge for indecent liberties \nwith child by custodian and the court-martial charge of rape preferred against him in \nMay 1998. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \n19 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n        \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments \nunder Guidelines J, D, and E in my whole-person analysis. I have also considered \nApplicant\u2019s good character references. However, I find that the totality of the evidence \nconcerning his dishonesty on his SCA leaves me with questions and doubts about his \neligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I find Applicant mitigated the Guideline \nJ security concerns that were cross alleged under Guideline D and Guideline E. I also \nfind Applicant mitigated the part of the Guideline E security concern alleging he \ndeliberately falsified his 2020 SCA by failing to disclose the May 1998 court-martial \ncharges of sodomy, conduct unbecoming an officer and gentleman, and indecent acts. I \ndo not find Applicant mitigated the part of the Guideline E security concern alleging he \ndeliberately falsified his 2020 SCA by failing to disclose his 2001 felony charge for \nindecent liberties with child by custodian and his May 1998 court-martial charge of rape. \nApplicant requested in his Answer that I consider granting him a waiver or \ngranting him eligibility with the imposition of appropriate conditions, in accordance with \nSEAD 4 Appendix C. (Answer; HE VIII) The adjudicative guidelines give me the \nauthority to approve a waiver \u201cdespite the presence of substantial issue information that \nwould normally preclude eligibility,\u201d with the provision that a waiver may be approved \n\u201conly when the benefit of initial or continued eligibility clearly outweighs any security \nconcerns,\u201d and that a waiver \u201cmay also require conditions for eligibility.\u201d The guidelines \nalso give me the authority to grant or continue eligibility \u201cdespite the presence of issue \ninformation that can be partially but not completely mitigated, with the provision that \nadditional security measures shall be required to mitigate the issue(s).\u201d It provides that \nsuch measures \u201cinclude, but are not limited to, additional security monitoring, access \nrestrictions, submission of periodic financial statements, or attendance at counseling \nsessions.\u201d I have not done so as I have concluded neither are warranted in this case. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline J:  \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.b:  \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline D:  \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 2.a: \nFor Applicant \n20 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nParagraph 3, Guideline E:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 3.a: \nAgainst Applicant (except  for the \npart of the allegation that alleges \nApplicant falsified his 2020 SCA \nby failing to list the May 1998 \ncourt-martial charges of sodomy, \nconduct unbecoming an officer \nand gentleman, and indecent \nacts, which I find for Applicant) \nSubparagraph 3.b:  \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

Based on my review of the pleadings, evidence submitted, and \ntestimony, I make the following additional findings of fact. \nApplicant is 55 years old. Since 2019, he has worked for his current employer, \nDefense Contractor C, as a senior director for business development. He earned a \nbachelor\u2019s degree in 1990, and a master\u2019s degree in 2000. He married in 1990 and \ndivorced in 2012. He remarried in 2016 and divorced in 2020. He has one adult child from \nhis first marriage, and two minor children from his second marriage. (Tr. 20-22; GE 1) \nApplicant served on active duty in the Army from 1990-2012 and retired as a \nColonel. During his service, he had six combat deployments and was awarded two \nBronze Stars, the Legion of Merit medal, as well as many other medals and \naccomplishments. The record shows that he was consistently recognized for excellence \nduring his military career. He retired as 100% disabled. After leaving the military, he \ncontinued to serve in his professional area of expertise by working for defense contractors \nin overseas locations promoting U.S. interests abroad. He has been recognized for \nexcellence in these positions as well. (Tr. 22-72; Answer at exhibit 3, 5; GE 1) \nWhen Applicant left the Army in 2012, he took a position with Defense Contractor \nA as a senior manager for business development in his professional area of expertise. In \n2013, he went to work for Defense Contractor B as the director of the office managing \nthis business area in Country A, in the Middle East. In 2014, his boss left the company \nand Applicant was promoted to his position, where he was responsible for 150 employees \nand 300 family members in Country A. (Tr. 22-72; GE 1) \nIn 2016, Defense Contractor B housed personnel from other international offices \nin Applicant\u2019s office space in Country A. During that time, Applicant reported an ethics \nviolation he witnessed by a senior company executive. The ethics violation concerned a \nsensitive issue that impacted worldwide business operations. In Country A, Applicant was \nthreatened by the senior company executive and told that he would be fired if did not \nwithdraw the complaint. At the time, Applicant left Country A because it had become a \nhostile work environment for him.

His work in the U.S. was \nintended to be temporary, and he was given several assignments for transfer to Europe, \nhowever the senior company executive, with which he had a conflict, denied those \ntransfers. In about 2017, he made another ethics complaint against the senior company \nexecutive that he was being specifically targeted for retribution for his previous ethics \ncomplaint in Country A. Before he made the second complaint, there were no concerns \nraised about him during his employment with Defense Contractor B. (Tr. 22-72) \nAfter Applicant made the second ethics complaint, a company investigator started \nlooking at Applicant\u2019s expenses. Applicant traveled extensively for over four years and \nhad filed over $600,000 in travel expenses during that time without problem. The \ninvestigator started examining Applicant\u2019s expenses after returning to the U.S., and then \nexamined how he traveled with company documents for international briefings. Applicant \ndiscovered during the investigation the company investigator was a domestic employee \nwho had no knowledge of or experience in Applicant\u2019s professional area of expertise, the \npractices and procedures employed in international business, or long-term international \ntravel for work. The investigator did not inform Applicant\u2019s supervisor (Witness One) about \nany of the allegations or ask him for expertise or clarification on any issue investigated. \nApplicant asserted this investigation was retaliation from the senior company executive \nand was an attempt to find a reason to fire him for cause. This effort was unsuccessful, \nand he was given a substantial severance agreement to leave his employment with \nDefense Contractor B, and not make any claims against them for what had occurred. (Tr. \n22-131) \nThe SOR alleges the following: \nUnder Guideline K, SOR \u00b6 1.a alleges while working overseas in 2014, Applicant \nwas given a written warning for sending an email containing classified information through \nan unclassified system.

A host-nation official asked a \ntechnical question based on an unclassified picture on the internet. Applicant relayed the \nquestion to his counterparts in Washington DC, and the question was flagged as \nclassified \u201cconfidential\u201d using a classification guide. Afterwards, Applicant discussed the \nmatter with his boss, but said he was never counseled or warned.

This allegation \nwas cross-alleged under Guideline E in \u00b6 2.a and Guideline M in \u00b6 3.a. GE 3 contains two \ninternal memorandum for the record from January 2019 written by the company \ninvestigator. The memorandum dated January 22, 2019, states in November 2018, \nApplicant added corporate information to his thumb drive before international travel, which \nraised concerns about International Traffic In Arms Regulations (ITAR) violations. \nApplicant told investigators that he needed to have the information on the thumb drives \nfor his international briefings to corporate and foreign partners. Applicant provided his \nbusiness thumb drive and personal thumb drives to the investigator for review. The \ninvestigation found there was no indication that ITAR information had been accessed \ninternationally. The memorandum states that his thumb drive use was a violation of IT \nsecurity policies. (GE 3 at pages 2-3, 6-7)   \nIn GE 3, the memorandum dated January 24, 2019, is a one-and-a-half-page \nsummary of a meeting with Applicant. It states a review of Applicant\u2019s thumb drive shows \nthere were no ITAR violations and the data he accessed was only company \ndocumentation. The memorandum states that using the documentation violated several \ninternal IT security policies. It also states that Applicant did not have a clear understanding \nof how to access the data in an international environment and was unclear on how to \nhandle the data overseas. (GE 3 at pages 2-3, 6-7) \nIn 2016, after leaving his assignment in the Middle East, Applicant worked in \nbusiness development with European nations in his professional area of expertise. His \njob was to travel to various European countries and brief the host nation and NATO \nofficials on the status of certain programs. In these briefings, Applicant would be \naccompanied by a Vice President of the company, who was responsible for all business \noperations in that country. Applicant explained that while DoD banned the use of thumb \ndrives in 2008, defense contractors used them as the primary means to travel overseas \nwith protected unclassified data. He stated that laptops and phones were seen as a \ngreater security risk. He had a thumb drive with a biometric lock, which he used to carry \nthe briefings he gave to foreign and NATO officials. He was given this thumb drive by his \nemployer. He also carried a thumb drive with personal records on it. Since he was \ntraveling for about half the year, he needed to be able to access personal records so that \nhe could assist his wife in resolving problems with their home, creditors, and related \npersonal matters. (Tr. 22-151) \nThe November 2018 event identified in the memorandum occurred in Country B, \nwhich is a NATO ally that hosts U.S. military facilities. Applicant\u2019s employer partnered \nwith a company from Country B and opened a joint office to offer their services to the host \nnation. This kind of partnership was common practice in NATO countries. Applicant and \nthe company Vice President, who was responsible for all business operations in Country \nB, were briefing host nation officials the following day.

There were no allegations of mishandling information on that \ntrip or during any other times of travel. Thumb drives are no longer used by the defense \nindustry, and Applicant follows the current regulations for handling protected information. \n(Tr. 72-151; GE 3) \nUnder Guideline E, SOR \u00b6 2.a cross-alleges allegations from Guidelines K, M and \nI, and the relevant facts are considered in those sections. \nSOR \u00b6 2.b alleges in 2018, Applicant misused a business credit card by making \nunauthorized personal charges. SOR \u00b6 2.c alleges from May 2018 to July 2018, Applicant \nviolated his employer\u2019s polices by seeking reimbursement for erroneous or unsupported \nexpenses on his travel expense reports. These issues are directly related and are \nconsidered together. \nGE 3 contains an internal memorandum for the record from January 2019, written \nby the company investigator. The memorandum dated January 22, 2019, is a four-and-\na-half-page summary which includes information about a financial investigation of \nApplicant\u2019s expense reports and a short summary of the corporate investigator\u2019s \ninteractions with Applicant. In August 2018, the investigator flagged Applicant\u2019s expense \nreports going back to 2013 for out-of-pocket expenses. Over about five years, Applicant \nhad $36,000 in out-of-pocket expenses. The memorandum stated that most of the \nexpenses came from international travel and the investigators did not have enough \ninformation in the report to draw negative conclusions, so they shifted their review to \ndomestic business travel. They found that Applicant used out-of-pocket expenses in the \nsame manner domestically as internationally. Some of the expenses were specifically \nidentified as appropriate. They speculated about times there were taxi expenses and \npersonal vehicle expenses on the same day. They also looked at days where hotel rooms \nwere not charged, laundry expenses, fast food receipts, local area travel, and personal \ntravel. The memorandum stated that questions to Applicant about expense reports were \nlimited because the investigator was more interested in his thumb drive. The investigator \nspeculated in the memo whether Applicant had been making inaccurate out-of-pocket \nexpenses for personal gain. (GE 3 at pages 4-8) \nApplicant explained that he spent hours on several occasions with the investigator \nexplaining his expense reports and charges, and none of it was captured in the \nmemorandum. He stated that he was unable to use his company credit card at times \nbecause the stripe was worn out, and he had to replace it. Some locations or service \nproviders overseas did not take credit cards or did not have an efficient method for using \nthem. He stated that he had about $600,000 of travel expenses during the timeframe they \nreviewed, and only 5% of that was out-of-pocket expenses. He reported there were simple \nexplanations for the expenses questioned. He repeatedly told the investigator that he \nused his personal vehicle to travel with his pregnant wife and left her with family members \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nwhile traveling overseas on business, and he stayed with family before leaving on these \ntrips.

Applicant said that these and other events explained the \nitems questioned by investigators. However, the corporate investigator did not record the \nexplanations in his memorandum, and no further information or meetings were requested \nby the investigator. (Tr. 22-151) \nFrom 2013-2018, Applicant was earning between $400,000 and $900,000 yearly, \nand had filed about $600,000 in travel expenses. The investigator only identified $1,630 \nof expenses that he thought was not unallowable. Applicant had an executive assistant \nthat handled his travel vouchers and expense reports until about early 2018, and he had \na clerk that assisted him while in the Army. There were no inquiries about his travel \nexpenses until this investigation started. Applicant\u2019s wife, who was a Certified Public \nAccountant, worked for a firm that handled Applicant\u2019s employer\u2019s portfolio, and knew the \ntravel voucher regulations and requirements. He stated that she repeatedly chided him \nfor not asking for more expense reimbursement while traveling, to which he was entitled. \n(Tr. 72-151; Answer at exhibit 5; AE B at page 4)  \nSOR \u00b6 2.d alleges in March 2019, Applicant was fired for violation of company \nrules. This allegation was based on the summary on page one of GE 3, which I do not \ngive any weight for the reasons discussed above. Applicant obtained a draft \nmemorandum (AE B) in which the corporate investigator outlined reasons for termination, \nbut there was no evidence that any of his findings or conclusions were ever adopted. \nApplicant provided evidence of a severance agreement (AE A), where he was paid a \nsubstantial sum for separating from his employer. Testimony from Applicant and his \nwitnesses established that he was an excellent employee and worked in a profitable \nbusiness area. His ethics complaints and resulting conflict with the senior company \nexecutive were the reasons that he was removed from his employment. The evidence \nshows the investigation of the travel-related expenses and thumb drives was an effort to \njustify terminating him for cause, but that effort failed. No evidence established that he \nwas fired for a violation of company rules, and it is unlikely he would have received any \nseverance if he was terminated for cause. This allegation is unfounded. (Tr. 22-157; GE \n3; AE A, B) \nSOR \u00b6 2.e alleges in July 2020, Applicant was charged with domestic violence-\nharassment. In May 2021, the case was Nolle Prosequi after successful completion of \npsychotherapy/counseling. Applicant denied ever being involved in domestic violence or \nharassment with his second wife. He was about 15 years her senior and they had a \ntumultuous relationship from the start of their marriage. They met when she worked as a \ntax preparer, and she showed romantic interest after learning about his income and \nassets. Early in the marriage he realized that she had a drinking problem. She refused to \nget help and he told her in January 2018 that he was divorcing her. Later that month, she \ntold him that she was pregnant, and they remained married. He reported that she stopped \ndrinking during her pregnancy but was abusing prescription medication. She was denied \naccess to the babies after birth, because of her drug abuse, and she restarted drinking in \n2019. In late 2019, he held an intervention, but she continued to drink.

Earlier that day she had filed for divorce and \nmade a domestic violence complaint for the May 25th  incident, claiming that he \nheadbutted her. He was arrested on July 8th. On July 10th  she sent an email asking for \n$1.5 million and assets for the divorce, to allow him visitation with their children, and \nwithdrawal of the domestic violence complaint. After he was arrested, he was required to \nmove out of their home, and she continued to live there expense free until April 2023. (Tr. \n22-151; Answer at exhibit 6, 7; GE 2) \nAfter his arrest, Applicant\u2019s supervisor at work came and bailed him out. Applicant \nstated that he was not part of a diversionary program, and the county prosecutor agreed \nto Nolle Prosequi his case because they lacked evidence that he had committed domestic \nviolence. His attorney told him that meeting with the counselor allowed them to easily \nmove the case for dismissal. Applicant reported that his relationship with his ex-wife is \nstill difficult, and they exchange the children in a public parking lot with surveillance \ncameras for this reason. Applicant\u2019s first wife submitted a character letter in the record in \nwhich she asserts that he did not show inappropriate levels of anger or any concerning \nbehavior in 22 years of marriage.

In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.(GE 3 at pages 2-3) \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n       \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in conjunction \nwith the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. The protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 \n2(b) requires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national \nsecurity eligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation of potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline K, Handling Protected Information  \nThe security concern for handling protected information is set out in AG \u00b6 33: \nDeliberate or negligent failure to comply with rules and regulations for \nhandling protected information-which includes classified and other sensitive \ngovernment information, and proprietary information-raises doubt about an \nindividual\u2019s trustworthiness, judgment, reliability, or willingness and ability \nto safeguard such information, and is a serious security concern. \nThe security concerns applicable in this case under AG \u00b6 34 are: \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n        \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(b) collecting or storing protected information in any unauthorized location; \n(c) loading, drafting, editing, modifying, storing, transmitting, or otherwise \nhandling protected information, including images, on any unauthorized \nequipment or medium; and  \n(g) any failure to comply with rules for the protection of classified or sensitive \nInformation. \nConditions that could mitigate the handling protected information security concerns \nare provided under AG \u00b6 35. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the behavior, or it has happened so \ninfrequently or under such unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur \nand does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment:  \n(b) the individual responded favorably to counseling or remedial security \ntraining and now demonstrates a positive attitude toward the discharge of \nsecurity responsibilities; \n(c) the security violations were due to improper or inadequate training or \nunclear instructions; and \n(d) the violation was inadvertent, it was promptly reported, there is no \nevidence of compromise, and it does not suggest a pattern. \nAG \u00b6 35 (a), (b), (c), and (d) apply. Applicant provided sufficient evidence to \nmitigate the security concerns raised in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b. The email incident happened \nover ten years ago, and the record shows it was inadvertent and a first-time violation. \nApplicant had a reasonable belief that the information was not classified. He worked with \nhis supervisor at the time on ways to address such issues in the future. Applicant provided \nsufficient evidence to mitigate the concerns about his thumb drive use in overseas travel. \nThe drive was provided by his employer. He was properly carrying and handling \ninformation for a legitimate business purpose overseas. The issue was not raised until a \nretaliatory investigation started against him in 2018. Thumb drives are no longer used by \ndefense industry, and there is no other evidence that he has improperly handled protected \ninformation. The handling protected information security concerns are mitigated. \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \nAG \u00b6 15 details the personal conduct security concern: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \n10 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes\u2026 \nThe SOR cross-alleges all the SOR allegations in \u00b6 2.a and four Guideline E \nspecific allegations in \u00b6\u00b6 2.b-2.e. The security concern applicable in this case under AG \n\u00b6 16 is: \n(c) credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is \nnot sufficient for an adverse determination under any other single guideline, \nbut which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-person \nassessment of questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack \nof candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations, or other \ncharacteristics indicating that the individual may not properly safeguard \nclassified or sensitive information.  \nConditions that could mitigate the financial considerations security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 17. The following are potentially applicable: \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; and  \n(f) the information was unsubstantiated or from a source of questionable \nreliability.  \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 17(c) and (f) apply to SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.a-2.e. \nSOR \u00b6 2.a cross-alleges SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b, 3.a, and 4.a. SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b, and 3.a \nwere mitigated under Guidelines K and M, and are also mitigated by AG \u00b6 17(c) and (f), \nfor the same reasons explained in those analysis sections. SOR \u00b6 4.a did not have \nsufficient evidence to establish the psychological conditions security concerns, and there \nis insufficient evidence to establish it as a personal conduct security concern. \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.b and 2.c concern Applicant\u2019s use of his company credit card and \nexpense reports. These issues were raised in the 2018 retaliatory investigation against \nApplicant, after he made two ethics complaints against a senior company executive. \nBetween 2013-2018, Applicant had claimed about $600,000 in travel expenses. He \nestablished there was only a question about $1,630 total of these expenses. He was \nearning between $400,000 and $900,000 yearly during this timeframe, and it is not \nreasonable to believe that he would have tried to steal $1,630 in unallowable expenses \nfrom his employer to enrich himself. He reported that he had an executive assistant that \nhelped him with expenses prior to returning to work in the U.S., and his expense reports \nwere never questioned. The investigation tried numerous ways to find violations in five \nyears of expense reports, but could only identify a few minor issues that Applicant \n11 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nasserted were explained and appropriate. His explanation about his company credit card \nuse and the expenses questioned is credible and reasonable. He has not had any issues \nwith these matters prior to 2018, or since then. These security concerns are mitigated by \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 17(c) and (f). \nThere was insufficient evidence to establish SOR \u00b6 2.d. Applicant provided \nevidence of a substantial severance agreement, which undercuts a finding that he was \nterminated for cause. He provided sufficient evidence to establish that the 2018 \ninvestigation was retaliation for two ethics complaints against a senior company \nexecutive. He also provided a draft memorandum which outlines the investigators \nreasoning for termination, but no evidence in the record shows that any of these findings \nwere ever adopted. Even if he was terminated in early 2019, the security concerns are \nmitigated by AG \u00b6\u00b6 17(c) and (f). \nSOR \u00b6 2.e is mitigated by AG \u00b6\u00b6 17(c) and (f). Applicant and his second wife had \na troublesome marriage. She abused alcohol and prescription medication, and she was \nviolent and emotionally unstable. The relationship severely degraded during the lockdown \nphase at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. His explanation about the incident that \noccurred on May 25, 2020, is credible and is not rebutted by other evidence in the record. \nHe provided sufficient evidence showing that he filed for divorce and emergency custody \nof the children twice prior to her allegations. He withdrew the filings both times because \nshe promised to stop substance abuse and get counseling. The timing of her domestic \nviolence complaint, divorce filing, and request for $1.5 million to allow him visitation with \ntheir children, and withdrawal of the domestic violence charges supports his narrative \nabout these events. The psychologist\u2019s report and the decision by the county prosecutor \nto Nolle Prosequi the case also supports Applicant\u2019s narrative. \nThe personal conduct security concerns are mitigated. \nGuideline M, Use of Information Technology  \nThe security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 39: \nFailure to comply with rules, procedures, guidelines, or regulations \npertaining to information technology systems may raise security concerns \nabout an individual's reliability and trustworthiness, calling into question the \nwillingness or ability to properly protect sensitive systems, networks, and \ninformation. Information Technology includes any computer-based, mobile, \nor wireless device used to create, store, access, process, manipulate, \nprotect, or move information. This includes any component, whether \nintegrated into a larger system or not, such as hardware, software, or \nfirmware, used to enable or facilitate these operations. \nSOR \u00b6 3.a cross-alleges the security concerns in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b, which were \nmitigated under Guideline K. The use of information technology security concern \napplicable in this case under AG \u00b6 40 is: \n12 \n\n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n        \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n(d) downloading, storing, or transmitting classified, sensitive, proprietary, or \nother protected information on or to any unauthorized information \ntechnology system.  \nConditions that could mitigate the financial considerations security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 41. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the behavior happened, or it happened \nunder such unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur and does not \ncast doubt on the individual's reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \nand \n(c) the conduct was unintentional or inadvertent and was followed by a \nprompt, good faith effort to correct the situation and by notification to \nappropriate personnel.  \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 41(a) and (c) apply. Applicant provided sufficient evidence to mitigate the \nsecurity concerns. The email incident happened over ten years ago, and the record shows \nit was inadvertent and a first-time violation. Applicant had a reasonable belief that the \ninformation was not classified. He worked with his supervisor at the time on ways to \naddress such issues in the future. Applicant provided sufficient evidence to mitigate the \nconcerns about his thumb drive use in overseas travel. The drive was provided by his \nemployer. He was properly carrying and handling information for a legitimate business \npurpose overseas. The issue was not raised until a retaliatory investigation started \nagainst him in 2018. Thumb drives are no longer used by defense industry, and there is \nno other evidence that he has improperly handled protected information. The use of \ninformation technology security concern is mitigated. \nGuideline I, Psychological Conditions \nAG \u00b6 27 articulates the security concern for psychological conditions: \nCertain emotional, mental, and personality conditions can impair judgment, \nreliability, or trustworthiness. A formal diagnosis of a disorder is not required \nfor there to be a concern under this guideline. A duly qualified mental health \nprofessional (e.g., clinical psychologist or psychiatrist) employed by, or \nacceptable to and approved by the U.S. Government, should be consulted \nwhen evaluating potentially disqualifying and mitigating information under \nthis guideline and an opinion, including prognosis, should be sought. No \nnegative inference concerning the standards in this guideline may be raised \nsolely on the basis of mental health counseling. \nThe security concerns potentially applicable in this case under AG \u00b6 28 are: \n13 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n(a) behavior that casts doubt on an individual's judgment, stability, reliability, \nor trustworthiness, not covered under any other guideline and that may \nindicate an emotional, mental, or personality condition, including, but not \nlimited to, irresponsible, violent, self-harm, suicidal, paranoid, manipulative, \nimpulsive, chronic lying, deceitful, exploitative, or bizarre behaviors;  \n(b) an opinion by a duly qualified mental health professional that the \nindividual has a condition that may impair judgment, stability, reliability, or \ntrustworthiness; \nThe government failed to establish this allegation. There is insufficient evidence to \nfind that Applicant has or had an emotional, mental, or personality condition that impairs \nhis judgment, stability, reliability, or trustworthiness. SOR \u00b6 4.a states that Applicant had \nadjustment order with anxiety, which is not a disqualifying condition. After Applicant was \narrested and falsely accused of domestic violence, he had anxiety, which was appropriate \nin the circumstance. He discussed this anxiety and issues associated with the dissolution \nof his marriage and separation from his children with a psychologist. The psychologist \nfound that Applicant had no significant mental health problems, and his anxiety and \nconcerns were temporary and in response to the circumstances with his ex-wife. After six \nsessions, the psychologist felt that no further treatment was warranted or necessary. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered his military \nservice, service as a government contractor, his awards, medals, and recognitions, and \nthe character letters. I considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions \nin light of all the facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guidelines K, E, M, and I in my whole-person analysis. \n14 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nI had the chance to observe Applicant\u2019s demeanor and asses his credibility.

I conclude that Applicant mitigated the \nhandling protected information, personal conduct, and use of information technology \nsecurity concerns. The psychological conditions security concerns were not established. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline K: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.b:  \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 2.a-2.e:  \n \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 3, Guideline M:  \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 3.a:  \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 4, Guideline I:  \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 4.a:  \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIt is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant a security \nclearance.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact The SOR as amended alleges Applicant failed to timely file federal income tax returns for tax years (TY) 2015 through 2021 (SOR \u00b6 1.a as amended), owed past-due taxes for TY 2016 through 2018 (SOR \u00b6 1.b), and had three delinquent student loans totaling about $4,728 (SOR \u00b6 1.c). In Applicant\u2019s Answer to the SOR and Amended SOR, she admitted the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.c and denied the allegation in SOR \u00b6 1.b, with explanations. Her admissions are incorporated in my findings of fact. Applicant is a 35-year-old insulator employed by a defense contractor since June 2023. She was employed by defense contractors as a machine operator from September 2021 to June 2023 and as a painter from March 2019 to September 2020. She was employed as a clerk from October 2015 to March 2019. She was unemployed for about two months in 2018 and from September 2020 to about September 2021.

In Applicant\u2019s Answer to the SOR and Amended SOR, \nshe admitted the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.c and denied the allegation in SOR \u00b6 \n1.b, with explanations. Her admissions are incorporated in my findings of fact. \nApplicant is a 35-year-old insulator employed by a defense contractor since June \n2023. She was employed by defense contractors as a machine operator from September \n2021 to June 2023 and as a painter from March 2019 to September 2020. She was \nemployed as a clerk from October 2015 to March 2019. She was unemployed for about \ntwo months in 2018 and from September 2020 to about September 2021. She graduated \nfrom high school in 2007 and attended college from about 2010 to 2011. She has never \nmarried and has no children. She has never held a security clearance. (GE 1, GE 4 at 4-\n5; Tr. 23-30, 46-54) \nIn Applicant\u2019s December 2020 SCA, she reported failing to file and pay, as \nrequired, her TY 2017 and 2018 federal income tax returns. (GE 1 at 37) She estimated \nshe owed about $1,050 in unpaid taxes for those two years, reported she mailed the \nreturns, and stated that her outstanding taxes would be paid in full. (Id.) She denied any \nother instances of failing to file or pay federal income taxes when due in the prior seven \nyears. (GE 1 at 38) During a March 2021 interview with a government investigator, she \nconfirmed the income tax information reported in her SCA and said she filed both \ndelinquent returns in December 2020 and that the delinquencies had been resolved. (GE \n4 at 9) \nIn her September 2021 response to interrogatories, Applicant reported: she filed \nfederal income tax returns for TY 2016 through 2020 in late 2020, she owed about $1,300 \nfor TY 2016 and 2017, and that she had no outstanding balance for TY 2018 through \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n        \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n2020.

(GE 4 at 15-46) \nApplicant attributes her financial problems to her failure to confirm that her \nelectronically filed income tax returns had been accepted by the IRS, loss of focus on \nfinancial issues due to emotional difficulties after her mother passed away in 2018, failure \nto pay sufficient attention to tax filing deadlines, and unemployment. (GE 4; Tr. 95-97, \n110-117) She has strived to be more responsible, moved in with her father to reduce \nexpenses, saved about $17,000, and has no other delinquent debts.

She also attributed her failure \nto timely file her TY 2017 and 2018 returns to emotional issues related to her mother\u2019s \ndeath.

(Answer; GE 5 at 3-8; Tr. 67-68) This allegation is resolved for Applicant. \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c-1.e: student loans placed for collection for $1,750, $2,000, and \n$943, respectively. Applicant admitted each allegation and submitted evidence she \napplied for a student-loan forgiveness program in October 2022. (Answer) The student \nloan accounts were opened in March 2010 and later assigned to the government. (GE 2 \nat 2-3, GE 3 at 4-5) A May 2021 credit report shows the accounts in collection for $1,750; \n$2,000; and $943, respectively.

(GE 3 at 4-5) \nApplicant testified as follows. She made no payments on student loans incurred in \nabout 2010 until a creditor offered her a payment plan with monthly payments of $5 to \n$20. She made payments under the agreement for six months to a year but did not recall \ndates. In March 2021, she told a government investigator she forgot to update payment \nplan documents when the loans were transferred to another creditor because she was \ndistracted after her mother died in 2018. She believed she received notices when the \nloans were placed for collection but has not contacted the creditor. She was informed \nloan payments would be paused pending review of her October 2022 student loan \nforgiveness application and has not heard anything about her application since. She plans \nto make any required payments. (Tr. 45-60; GE 4 at 9; Answer) \nApplicant testified she has earned about $70,000 a year since September 2021. \nShe has about $1,000 in a checking account and $17,000 in savings that she hopes to \nuse to purchase real estate. She has no retirement account. She lives with her father to \nreduce expenses and estimates her total monthly expenses at about $3,000. She \nvacationed in Country A in 2018 (1-5 days), Country B in 2020 (1-5 days), Country C in \n2022 (at a cost of about $1,000) and Country D in 2023 (at a cost of about $1.5K); many \nof her travel expenses were paid by family members. She has not sought financial \ncounseling. She hopes to do better on her taxes, does not have other delinquent debts, \nand said her credit score is almost 800. (GE 1 at 28-30; Tr. 25-34, 73-74) \nDuring the hearing Applicant was informed of the importance of providing \ndocumentary evidence of income tax and debt payments, contact with creditors, efforts \nto address or resolve her financial problems, and her current financial circumstances.

Or. 10865 \u00a7 2.  \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge \napplies these guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \n\u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 15-01253 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2016).  \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, \nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-\n31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).  \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-\n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n20700 at 3 (App. Bd.

An individual who is financially \noverextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or otherwise \nquestionable acts to generate funds. . . .  \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified information to raise money. It encompasses concerns about a \nperson\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting classified \ninformation. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information. See ISCR \nCase No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \nApplicant\u2019s admissions and the documentary evidence reflecting her failures to \ntimely file federal income tax returns for TY 2015 through 2021 and delinquent student \nloans are sufficient to establish the following disqualifying conditions under this guideline: \nAG \u00b6 19(a): inability to satisfy debts;  \nAG \u00b6 19(b): unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so;  \nAG \u00b6 19(c): a history of not meeting financial obligations; and  \nAG \u00b6 19(f): failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local \nincome tax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax as required.  \nThe following mitigating conditions are potentially applicable: \nAG \u00b6 20(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not \ncast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment;  \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(b): the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \nAG \u00b6 20(c): the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling \nfor the problem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit \ncredit counseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem \nis being resolved or is under control; \nAG \u00b6 20(d): the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to \nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and  \nAG \u00b6 20(g): the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax \nauthority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \nApplicant provided important mitigating information.

And her financial circumstances have apparently significantly improved. \nHowever, the appeal board has noted: \nThe mere filing of delinquent tax returns or the existence of a payment \narrangement with an appropriate tax authority does not compel a Judge to \nissue a favorable decision. As with the application of any mitigating \ncondition, the Judge must examine the record evidence and decide whether \nthe favorable evidence outweighs the unfavorable evidence, or vice versa. \nThe timing of corrective action is an appropriate factor for the Judge to \nconsider in the application of mitigating condition 20(g) as well as in \nconsidering aspects of other overlapping mitigating conditions, such as, in \ndetermining \nwhether \nan \napplicant \nacted \nresponsibly \nunder \nthe \ncircumstances, whether an applicant\u2019s past financial deficiencies are \nunlikely to recur, or whether an applicant initiated good-faith efforts to \nresolve financial problems. \nISCR Case No. 17-01807 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Mar. 7, 2018) (citations omitted) \nIn this case, Applicant filed her overdue federal income tax returns for TY 2015 \nthrough 2018 after submitting her SCA. Although she filed her delinquent TY 2019 income \ntax return before submitting her SCA, she failed to timely file her TY 2020 and TY 2021 \nreturns even after she was interviewed by a government investigator.

Although she \nincurred student loan debt in 2010, she said her only payments on those loans were \nmonthly payments of $5 to $20 for about a year, a credit report shows no payments since \nJune 2018, and the only apparent action she has taken since is to apply for student loan \nforgiveness in October 2022. \nAG \u00b6 20(a) is not established for SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a or 1.c through 1.e. Applicant failed to \ntimely file her federal income tax returns for at least seven tax years (TY 2015 through \nTY 2021). After responding to the SOR, she also failed to timely file her income tax return \nfor TY 2022, and, as of November 15, 2023, still owed $222 in penalties and interest. It \nappears she may have experienced tax problems as early as TY 2009 based upon the \n$3,054 credit from TY 2019 that was \u201ctransferred out to [TY 2009].\u201d (GE 4 at 44, GE 5 at \n9-10) She has a limited record of payment on student loans incurred in 2010 and has \nmade no payments since June 2018, and her only action since 2018 was to apply for a \nforgiveness program in October 2022. The evidence is insufficient to conclude this \nconduct is unlikely to recur, and her behavior casts doubt on her current reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and good judgment. \nAG \u00b6 20(b) is not fully established. Applicant\u2019s periods of unemployment and \nemotional difficulties after her mother passed away in 2018 were conditions largely \nbeyond her control. However, she has not provided sufficient evidence that she acted \nresponsibly under the circumstances. \nAG \u00b6 20(c) does not apply because Applicant has not received financial \ncounseling. \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 20(d) and 20(g) are established for the delinquent income taxes alleged in \nSOR \u00b6 1.b. \nAG \u00b6 20(d) is not established for the student loan debt alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c \nthrough 1.e. Applicant provided insufficient evidence to support a conclusion that she has \ninitiated or is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay her delinquent student loans. \nAG \u00b6 20(g) is not established for SOR \u00b6 1.a. Applicant\u2019s eventual compliance with \nher tax filing obligations does not end the inquiry. A security clearance adjudication is not \na tax-enforcement procedure. It is an evaluation of an individual\u2019s judgment, reliability, \nand trustworthiness. Her long-term procrastination regarding filing federal income tax \nreturns and addressing her student loan debt indicate she lacks the good judgment and \nreliability required of persons who are granted access to classified information. ISCR \nCase No. 14-04159 (App. Bd. Aug. 1, 2016). \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a public trust position by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nI have incorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis \nand applied the adjudicative factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). I considered Applicant\u2019s age, education, \nemployment history, improved financial circumstances, and that her financial problems \nwere caused, in part, by circumstances beyond her control. I also found Applicant to be \ncredible and sincere. However, Applicant has not demonstrated a reliable financial track \nrecord of timely filing federal income tax returns or with respect to her student loans. The \nrecord evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and \nsuitability for a security clearance. \nThis decision should not be construed as a determination that Applicant cannot or \nwill not attain the state of reform necessary for award of a security clearance in the future. \nWith more effort towards establishment of a track record of timely filing her income tax \nreturns and resolving her delinquent student loans, she may well be able in the future to \ndemonstrate persuasive evidence of her security clearance worthiness. \nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under Guideline F and \nevaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has \nnot mitigated the security concerns raised by her delinquent debts. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.b:  \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.c-1.e: \n \nAgainst Applicant \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nEric C. Price \nAdministrative Judge \n10 \n",

Dr. E \nconcluded: \n[Applicant] went on trips to Peru with the attitude of \u201cScrew it! What are they \ngoing to do to me?\u201d His view is that all the allegations pertaining to him lying \nabout various matters were \u201ctrumped up stuff.\u201d \nIt is possible that [Applicant\u2019s] command was not supportive of him and \ndeveloped a negative view of him due to his medical and behavioral \nproblems. However, based on the totality of the information available to me, \nmy impression is that [he] is [a] person who is willing to violate rules if he \nbelieves he can do so without being discovered and if doing so helps him \nattain an objective. If he is discovered, he seems to be a person who adopts \nunsophisticated tactics to avoid trouble, including denial in the face of \nobvious evidence and dishonesty. While I acknowledge that most of the \nevidence of his bad judgment, poor decision making, and rule-violating \nbehaviors occurred almost a decade ago, there are indications that he \nomitted information on his SF 86 in 2018 (e.g., overlooking his present \nmarriage) and that he provided misleading information during the present \n3 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \nevaluation (e.g., denying problems while in the Navy until confronted). This \nsuggests that he continues to rely on omissions, counteraccusations, and \ndenials to resolve problem situations (e.g., security clearance investigation). \nIt seems likely he would still lie to cover his mistakes\u2014a serious concern if \nhe holds a security clearance and/or works as an aircraft mechanic. \nCONCLUSIONS: Based on available data, [Applicant\u2019s] mental health \nconditions do not presently impair his willingness or ability to safeguard \nclassified information. Additionally, given the data he reported is accurate, \nthe risk of an exacerbation of symptoms seems to be low at this point in \ntime. However, [he] has a demonstrated pattern of rule-violating behavior, \npoor judgment, and dishonesty that could reasonably and significantly \ndiminish his trustworthiness and judgment in a national security context. \n(GE 4 at 9-10)    \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.b and 2.c allege in November 2012, Applicant was involuntarily \ncommitted for mental-health treatment, and in January 2013, Applicant was voluntarily \nadmitted for mental-health treatment. At his hearing, Applicant said he had suicidal \nideations. (Tr. 69) He was an inpatient for about 14 days in November 2012, and he said \nhis treatment was outpatient in January 2013. (Tr. 68) \nIn 2012, Applicant was diagnosed with ulcerative colitis, and he lost about 35\npounds. (Tr. 22) He was unable to complete physical activity, and his former spouse was \nnot letting him see his children. (Tr. 23) He became extremely depressed. (Tr. 23) \nApplicant\u2019s father called Applicant\u2019s supervisor and insisted that he receive help. (Tr. 24) \nThe VA is currently treating him for bipolar disorder. (Tr. 60) He sees a VA psychiatrist \nonce every three months. (Tr. 60) He takes lithium twice a day. (Tr. 61) He did not provide \nany VA medical treatment records to corroborate his statements about consistently \nreceiving counseling and treatment. \n \nI note that Applicant told Dr. E that he had a three-year-old daughter with Ms. G. \n(Tr. 38) At his hearing, he said he misspoke. (Tr. 38) He said Ms. G had a daughter, and \nhe was not her father. (Tr. 39) He told Dr. E that he was accepting her as his daughter. \n(Tr. 39) \nApplicant did not submit any documentation contradicting Dr. E\u2019s opinions and \nconclusions. In support of his denial of SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.a, 2.b, and 2.c in his SOR response, he \nasserted he supported his inpatient treatment when he asked his father for help, and \ntherefore, it was not really involuntary. He said Dr. E\u2019s conclusions were probably based \non the allegations of others and probably incorrect. He is feeling much better now than \nhe felt in 2012.   \nHandling Protected Information and Personal Conduct \nSOR \u00b6 3.a alleges Applicant improperly stored sensitive aircraft information on his \npersonal computer in about July 2010.

(GE 3 at 6) He said: \nHer friend spoke English, German, and Spanish. I don\u2019t remember her \nname. I never took her to the base. I left a personal [laptop computer] in her \ncustody. On that laptop was aircraft maintenance records . . .  and email \ntraffic pertaining to the aircraft.

(Tr. \n58, 61-62, 70) \nOn November 7, 2012, the NCIS briefed a legal officer about Applicant\u2019s alleged \nactions relating to Article 92, Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ) for violation of an \norder and Article 107, UCMJ for making a false statement.

(Tr. 27-28, 62, 66) After his hearing, Applicant made a diligent \neffort to locate information from the SCM; however, he was unable to obtain any \ndocumentation from his SCM. (Tr. 63; AE B) Section 15 Military History-- Discipline of his \nMay 5, 2018 SCA asks, \u201cIn the last 7years have you been subject to court-martial or other \ndisciplinary procedure under the Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ), such as Article \n15, [c]aptain\u2019s mast, Article 135 Court of inquiry, etc.?\u201d (GE 1 at 21) He answered, \u201cNo.\u201d \n(Id.) However, he did disclose on his SCA that he \u201cwent to a disciplinary review board\u201d \nbased on issues stemming from ulcerative colitis and physical fitness training. At his \nhearing, he did not know why he failed to list his SCM in his 2018 SCA.

They were personal trips, and I used my blue passport.\u201d (GE 3 at 7) \nApplicant said he did not inform one command that he was traveling to Peru. (Tr. \n42) He said he submitted leave papers to his squadron that he was going to Peru, and he \nreceived a threat briefing from that command before traveling to Peru. (Tr. 42-46) He said \nhe told the NCIS he did not inform his command or security of his travel to Peru on those \nfour occasions.

In fact, he flew to Peru for the wedding. He admitted to the NCIS that \nhe made a false statement to his command about getting married over the telephone. \n(GE 3 at 8) He said he \u201cthought [he] would get in trouble if the command found out [he] \nhad gone to Peru without going through the proper procedures.\u201d (Tr. 53; GE 3) \nSOR \u00b6 4.e alleges Applicant made a false statement to military investigators during \nhis October 25, 2012 personal subject interview (PSI).

He \nsaid he had married this individual, and he was voluntarily sending her money. \nApplicant\u2019s October 25, 2012 statement to NCIS investigators indicates he told two \nsenior petty officers that Ms. G threatened him by telling him that unless he provided \nfunds to her she would get a friend of hers from another part of the state where he lived \nto come to his location and hurt him and his family. (GE 3 at 8) He told the NCIS that Ms. \nG demanded $2,000 from him, and when he expressed reluctance to give her the money, \n\u201cshe said that she had friends [living in the same state where he lived] and they could find \n[him] which [he] understood to be a threat.\u201d (Id. at 6) The NCIS statement states, \u201cAlso in \nthe above paragraphs I was not truthful with Agents . . . about being extorted by [Ms. G].\u201d \n(Id. at 8) Applicant admitted that his story about being extorted was a lie.

Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \nIndustry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nabout potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Clearance \ndecisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a \ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 7. \nThus, nothing in this decision should be construed to suggest that it is based, in whole or \nin part, on any express or implied determination about applicant\u2019s allegiance, loyalty, or \npatriotism. It is merely an indication the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the \nPresident, Secretary of Defense, and Director of National Intelligence have established \nfor issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 at 2 \n(App. Bd. May 2, 1996). \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts.

Sept. 24, 2013), the DOHA Appeal \nBoard concisely explained Applicant\u2019s responsibility for proving the applicability of \nmitigating conditions as follows: \nOnce a concern arises regarding an Applicant\u2019s security clearance \neligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance of \na security clearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th \nCir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991). After the Government \npresents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the \napplicant to rebut or mitigate those concerns. See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. The \nstandard applicable in security clearance decisions is that articulated in \nEgan, supra. \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access \nto classified information will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nDirective, Enclosure 2, [App. A] \u00b6 2(b).   \nApplicant made a statement to NCIS about giving his laptop computer to Ms. G or \nMs. G\u2019s friend from Miami. The August 25, 2012 NCIS statement was written and under \noath. Applicant said Ms. G had a friend from Miami. Applicant further said in his NCIS \nstatement: \nHer friend spoke English, German, and Spanish. I don\u2019t remember her \nname. I never took her to the base. I left a personal [laptop computer] in her \ncustody. On that laptop was aircraft maintenance records . . .  and email \ntraffic pertaining to the aircraft. I don\u2019t think that the maintenance records \nwere classified but I am not sure about some of the emails. (GE 3 at 6) \nApplicant\u2019s statement at the hearing that there was no sensitive information on the \ncomputer is not credible. However, Applicant\u2019s compromise of sensitive and possibly \nclassified information occurred more than 10 years ago, and he disclosed the compromise \nto the NCIS in 2012. The compromise is not recent, it is unlikely to recur; and it does not \ncast doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment. Handling protected \ninformation security concerns are mitigated. \nPsychological Conditions \nAG \u00b6 27 articulates the security concern for psychological conditions: \nCertain emotional, mental, and personality conditions can impair judgment, \nreliability, or trustworthiness. A formal diagnosis of a disorder is not required \nfor there to be a concern under this guideline. A duly qualified mental health \nprofessional (e.g., clinical psychologist or psychiatrist) employed by, or \nacceptable to and approved by the U.S. Government, should be consulted \nwhen evaluating potentially disqualifying and mitigating information under \nthis guideline and an opinion, including prognosis, should be sought. No \n12 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nnegative inference concerning the standards in this guideline may be raised \nsolely on the basis of mental health counseling. \nAG \u00b6 28 provides conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying in this case: \n(a) behavior that casts doubt on an individual's judgment, stability, reliability, \nor trustworthiness, not covered under any other guideline and that may \nindicate an emotional, mental, or personality condition, including, but not \nlimited to, irresponsible, violent, self-harm, suicidal, paranoid, manipulative, \nimpulsive, chronic lying, deceitful, exploitative, or bizarre behaviors;  \n(b) an opinion by a duly qualified mental health professional that the \nindividual has a condition that may impair judgment, stability, reliability, or \ntrustworthiness;  \n(c) voluntary or involuntary inpatient hospitalization; and \n(d) failure to follow a prescribed treatment plan related to a diagnosed \npsychological/psychiatric condition that may impair judgment, stability, \nreliability, or trustworthiness, including, but not limited to, failure to take \nprescribed medication or failure to attend required counseling sessions. \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 28(b) and 28(d) do not apply. AG \u00b6\u00b6 29(a) and 29(c) have some application \nand will be discussed in the mitigating section, infra. \nAG \u00b6 29 lists conditions that could mitigate security concerns as follows: \n(a) the identified condition is readily controllable with treatment, and the \nindividual has demonstrated ongoing and consistent compliance with the \ntreatment plan; \n(b) the individual has voluntarily entered a counseling or treatment program \nfor a condition that is amenable to treatment, and the individual is currently \nreceiving counseling or treatment with a favorable prognosis by a duly \nqualified mental health professional; \n(c) recent opinion by a duly qualified mental health professional employed \nby, or acceptable to and approved by, the U.S. Government that an \nindividual\u2019s previous condition is under control or in remission, and has a \nlow probability of recurrence or exacerbation; \n(d) the past psychological/psychiatric condition was temporary, the situation \nhas been resolved, and the individual no longer shows indications of \nemotional instability; and \n(e) there is no indication of a current problem. \n13 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \nNone of the mitigating conditions apply. On March 9, 2021, Dr. E, a psychologist, \nevaluated Applicant and said: \nCONCLUSIONS: Based on available data, [Applicant\u2019s] mental health\nconditions do not presently impair his willingness or ability to safeguard\nclassified information. Additionally, given the data he reported is accurate,\nthe risk of an exacerbation of symptoms seems to be low at this point in\ntime. However, [he] has a demonstrated pattern of rule-violating behavior,\npoor judgment, and dishonesty that could reasonably and significantly\ndiminish his trustworthiness and judgment in a national security context.\n(GE 4 at 9-10)    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nDr. E diagnosed Applicant with Bipolar I Disorder, severe, in partial remission, most \nrecent episode manic; Other Specified Anxiety Disorder (with symptoms of agoraphobia \nand panic); and Alcohol Use Disorder, moderate, in sustained remission. \nAt his hearing, Applicant said he had suicidal ideations. He was an inpatient for \nabout 14 days in November 2012, and his treatment was outpatient in January 2013. He \nwas extremely depressed. The VA is currently treating him for bipolar disorder. He sees \na VA psychiatrist once every three months. He takes lithium twice a day. \nDr. E did not indicate a causal relationship between Applicant\u2019s mental-health \nissues and his multiple false statements and refusals to accept responsibility for his \nconduct. In USAF-M Case No. 23-00056-R at 4 n. 1 (App. Bd. Aug. 31, 2023), the Appeal \nBoard rejected the contention that AG \u00b6 28(a) was a catch-all provision for conduct \nalleged under Guideline E, personal conduct. The Appeal Board said: \nThe language of these two disqualifying conditions is not only tailored to \ntheir specific Guideline but is also linguistically distinct \u2013 AG \u00b6 28(a) \nconsiders behavior \u201cnot covered under any other guideline and that may \nindicate an emotional, mental, or personality disorder,\u201d while AG \u00b6 16(d) \nconsiders information \u201cnot explicitly covered under any other guideline.\u201d \n(Emphasis added). Moreover, the language of AG \u00b6 16(d) is inclusive in \nnature and provides a basis to allege information that \u201cmay not be sufficient \nby itself for an adverse determination.\u201d As discussed further herein, the \nlanguage of AG \u00b6 28(a) is designed to exclude allegations of conduct, which \nare otherwise fully addressed elsewhere in the Guidelines, and prevent \nunnecessary duplication. \nApplicant\u2019s impatient mental-health treatment in 2012 was more than a decade \nago. His credibility issues are discussed under the personal conduct guideline, infra. The \nrecord does not establish that his mental-health issues continue to be a security concern. \nPsychological conditions are mitigated. \n14 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nForeign Influence \nAG \u00b6 6 explains the security concern about \u201cforeign contacts and interests\u201d stating: \nForeign contacts and interests, including, but not limited to, business, \nfinancial, and property interests, are a national security concern if they result \nin divided allegiance. They may also be a national security concern if they \ncreate circumstances in which the individual may be manipulated or induced \nto help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a way \ninconsistent with U.S. interests or otherwise made vulnerable to pressure \nor coercion by any foreign interest. Assessment of foreign contacts and \ninterests should consider the country in which the foreign contact or interest \nis located, including, but not limited to, considerations such as whether it is \nknown to target U.S. citizens to obtain classified or sensitive information or \nis associated with a risk of terrorism. \nAG \u00b6 7 lists one condition that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying in this case, \u201c(c) failure to report or fully disclose, when required, association \nwith a foreign person, group, government, or country.\u201d \nSOR \u00b6 1.a alleges and the record establishes that Applicant is married to Ms. G, \nwho a citizen and resident of Peru. He repeatedly and deliberately failed to timely disclose \nthis relationship to security officials, as required. AG \u00b6 7(a) is established. Additional \ndiscussion is in the mitigating section, infra. \nAG \u00b6 8 lists six conditions that could mitigate foreign influence security concerns \nincluding: \n(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in which\nthese persons are located, or the positions or activities of those persons in\nthat country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be placed in a\nposition of having to choose between the interests of a foreign individual,\ngroup, organization, or government and the interests of the United States; \n \n \n \n \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of \nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, or allegiance to the group, \ngovernment, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such deep and \nlongstanding relationships and loyalties in the United States, that the \nindividual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the \nU.S. interest; \n(c) contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and infrequent \nthat there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign influence or \nexploitation; \n(d) the foreign contacts and activities are on U.S. Government business or \nare approved by the agency head or designee; \n15 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(e) the individual has promptly complied with existing agency requirements \nregarding the reporting of contacts, requests, or threats from persons, \ngroups, or organizations from a foreign country; and \n(f) the value or routine nature of the foreign business, financial, or property \ninterests is such that they are unlikely to result in a conflict and could not be \nused effectively to influence, manipulate, or pressure the individual. \nIn July 2010, Applicant met Ms. G when he was in Peru. In September 2012, he \ninformed the Navy of his marriage to Ms. G. The marriage was documented in his Navy \npersonnel records. The last time Applicant was in Peru was in 2013, and the last time he \nsaw Ms. G was in 2013. From about 2018 to 2021, he talked to her about twice a week, \nand the last time he talked to her was in 2021. He denied her requests for funds during \nthe 2018 to 2021 time period. It is unlikely that he will resume his relationship with Ms. G. \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 8(a) and 8(c) are established. \nThe falsification and integrity elements in the disqualifying condition in SOR \u00b6 1.a \nare cross-alleged in SOR \u00b6 4 and are thoroughly addressed under the personal conduct \nguideline. Foreign influence security concerns are mitigated. \nPersonal Conduct \nAG \u00b6 15 explains why personal conduct is a security concern as follows: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process. . . . \nAG \u00b6 16 provides two personal conduct disqualifying conditions that are relevant \nin this case. AG \u00b6\u00b6 16(a) and 16(b) read: \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar \nform used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, \naward benefits or status, determine national security eligibility or \ntrustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities; and \n(b) deliberately providing false or misleading information; or concealing or \nomitting information, concerning relevant facts to an employer, investigator, \nsecurity official, competent medical or mental health professional involved \nin making a recommendation relevant to a national security eligibility \ndetermination, or other official government representative. \n16 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 4.a cross-alleges the allegation that he gave a laptop computer containing \nsensitive Navy information to a foreign national. As indicated under the handling protected \ninformation guideline, this conduct is not recent, is isolated, and is unlikely to recur. SOR \n\u00b6 4.a is mitigated for the reasons stated under the handling protected information \nguideline, supra. \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 4.b through 4.o allege 14 instances where Applicant failed to disclose or \nprovided false information to his command, in his 2018 SCA, and in 2018 in during OPM \nPSIs. SOR \u00b6 4.g was found for Applicant because the SCA question did not specifically \nask about Applicant\u2019s marriage to Ms. G. \n\u201cApplicant\u2019s statements about his intent and state of mind when he executed his \nSecurity Clearance Application were relevant evidence, but they [are] not binding on the \nAdministrative Judge.\u201d ISCR Case No. 04-09488 at 2 (App. Bd. Nov. 29, 2006) (citation \nomitted). In ADP Case No. 17-03932 at 3 (App. Bd. Feb. 14, 2019), the Appeal Board \nrecognized the importance of circumstantial evidence of intent in falsification cases: \nWhen evaluating the deliberate nature of an alleged falsification, a Judge \nshould consider the applicant\u2019s mens rea in light of the entirety of the record \nevidence. See, e.g., ADP Case No. 15-07979 at 5 (App. Bd. May 30, 2017). \nAs a practical matter, a finding regarding an applicant\u2019s intent or state of \nmind may not always be based on an applicant\u2019s statements, but rather may \nrely on circumstantial evidence. Id. \nThe most accurate description of Applicant\u2019s relationship with and payments to Ms. \nG, his release of sensitive Navy information to Ms. G\u2019s friend from Miami, failures to \ndisclose trips to Peru, and his false claims of extortion payments to Ms. G were in his \nsworn statement to the NCIS in 2012. In response to questions about false information in \nhis SCA and during OPM PSIs, he said he could not remember his state of mind. He \ndeliberately failed to disclose or provided false information to his command or security \nofficials or both about the following issues: (1) getting married to Ms. G over the \ntelephone; (2) some of his trips to Peru; (3) payments to Ms. G; (4) extortion by Ms. G; \n(5) the recency of his contacts with Ms. G; and (6) mental-health treatment. AG \u00b6\u00b6 16(a) \nand 16(b) are established. \nAG \u00b6 17 includes six conditions which could mitigate personal conduct security \nconcerns: \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts;  \n(b) the refusal or failure to cooperate, omission, or concealment was caused \nor significantly contributed to by advice of legal counsel or of a person with \nprofessional responsibilities for advising or instructing the individual \nspecifically concerning security processes. Upon being made aware of the \nrequirement to cooperate or provide the information, the individual \ncooperated fully and truthfully; \n17 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, \nunreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to \nrecur;  \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate vulnerability \nto exploitation, manipulation, or duress; and \n(f) the information was unsubstantiated or from a source of questionable \nreliability. \nApplicant did not disclose a summary court-martial on his 2018 SCA or his 2018 \nOPM PSI. At his hearing, Applicant lied when he falsely claimed he did not have sensitive \nNavy information on the computer he gave to Ms. G or to Ms. G\u2019s friend from Miami. He \nalso lied at his hearing when he said he informed his command about his trips to Peru \nand received threat briefings. In ISCR Case No. 03-20327 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, 2006), \nthe Appeal Board listed five circumstances in which conduct not alleged in an SOR may \nbe considered, stating: \n(a) to assess an applicant\u2019s credibility; (b) to evaluate an applicant\u2019s \nevidence of extenuation, mitigation, or changed circumstances; (c) to \nconsider whether an applicant has demonstrated successful rehabilitation; \n(d) to decide whether a particular provision of the Adjudicative Guidelines is \napplicable; or (e) to provide evidence for whole person analysis under \nDirective Section 6.3. \nId. (citing ISCR Case No. 02-07218 at 3 (App. Bd. Mar. 15, 2004); ISCR Case No. 00-\n0633 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct. 24, 2003)). See also ISCR Case No. 12-09719 at 3 (App. Bd. \nApr. 6, 2016) (citing ISCR Case No. 14-00151 at 3, n. 1 (App. Bd. Sept. 12, 2014); ISCR \nCase No. 03-20327 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, 2006)). These non-SOR allegations will not \nbe considered except for the five purposes listed above. \nApplicant\u2019s lies and failures to accept responsibility show a lack of rehabilitation. I \nhave lingering concerns that his lapses in judgment may recur and continue to cast doubt \non his reliability, trustworthiness, and judgment. Personal conduct security concerns are \nnot mitigated. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \n18 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), \u201c[t]he ultimate determination\u201d of whether to grant a security \nclearance \u201cmust be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines\u201d and the whole-person concept. My comments under Guideline B, I, K, \nand E are incorporated in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) \nwere addressed under those guidelines but some warrant additional comment. \nApplicant is a 51-year-old aircraft mechanic who has worked in that position for a \ngovernment contractor for almost six years. He served in the Navy from 1993 to 2013; his \nspecialty was avionics technician; and he honorably retired as a chief petty officer. He \nhas a 100 percent VA disability rating. Seventy percent of his disability rating is for bipolar \ndisorder. In 2018, he received a bachelor\u2019s degree. \nApplicant had a successful Navy career, and he received numerous Navy medals \nand awards. He has had a successful career working for the government contractor as \nshown by his continued employment. In 2012, Applicant was depressed, expressed \nsuicidal ideation, and was diagnosed with bipolar disorder. In 2012 and 2013, he received \ninpatient and/or outpatient mental-health treatment. Dr. E concluded his \u201cmental health \nconditions do not presently impair his willingness or ability to safeguard classified \ninformation. Additionally, given the data he reported is accurate, the risk of an \nexacerbation of symptoms seems to be low at this point in time.\u201d (GE 4 at 10) \nThe reasons for revocation of Applicant\u2019s security clearance are more persuasive. \nHe repeatedly lied, and his credibility is poor. His lies to security officials, including his \nlies at his hearing, and to his command when he was in the Navy are serious. They cast \ndoubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, and judgment. I do not have confidence \nthat he would follow orders or comply with rules unless he personally agrees with them. \nHis series of judgment lapses cause unmitigated security concerns. Applicant is not an \nhonest, candid, and forthright person. His multiple misstatements raise a serious concern \nthat he would not voluntarily and honestly report a breach of security if reporting that \nbreach of security would risk his own personal reputation, employment, or continued \naccess to classified information. \nIt is well settled that once a concern arises regarding an applicant\u2019s security \nclearance eligibility, there is a strong presumption against granting a security clearance. \nSee Dorfmont, 913 F. 2d at 1401. \u201c[A] favorable clearance decision means that the record \n19 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n______________________ \ndiscloses no basis for doubt about an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified \ninformation.\u201d ISCR Case No. 18-02085 at 7 (App. Bd. Jan. 3, 2020) (citing ISCR Case \nNo. 12-00270 at 3 (App. Bd. Jan. 17, 2014)). \nI have carefully applied the law, as set forth in Egan, Exec. Or. 10865, the Directive, \nthe AGs, and the Appeal Board\u2019s jurisprudence to the facts and circumstances in the \ncontext of the whole person. Applicant mitigated handling protected information, foreign \ninfluence, and psychological conditions security concerns; however, he failed to mitigate \npersonal conduct security concerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline B: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 1.a: \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline I: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 2.a through 2.c: \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 3, Guideline K:  \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 3.a: \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 4, Guideline E: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 4.a: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 4.b through 4.f: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 4.g: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 4.h through 4.o: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s \neligibility for access to classified information.

(Tr. 7-10; GE 1 at 12-15, 20) \nSOR \u00b6 1.a \u2013 The cable account was opened in 2018 and transferred for \ncollection in August 2020 for $401. Applicant claims he was evicted from the residence \nin August 2015 (providing no forwarding address) before receiving what he believes \nwas the last bill from the cable company. He maintains that he never received the bill. \nHe intended to resolve the account when he received a higher salary. (GE 4 at 26; Tr. \n21) The account is unpaid. \nSOR \u00b6 1.b - The auto account of $8,551 was transferred for collection in \nDecember 2017. Applicant claimed that the car was repossessed in July 2014 after he \nlost his security clearance and stopped making payments. He contended that the car \nwas sold through an auction at a price that covered the balance owed on the car. The \ncar company supplied no paperwork to Applicant after the auction. He then indicated \nthat the paperwork he received from the auto company was in a filing cabinet located in \na storage unit. However, the storage unit manager would not permit him to retrieve the \ndocumentation from the unit because the storage company auctioned off his unit after \nhe missed a $174 payment. The date when the storage unit was auctioned off does not \nappear in the record. Applicant has not contacted the auto company since the auction \nsale to replace the paperwork that was supposedly lost when the unit was sold. (GE 4 at \n26; Tr. 36-38, 39-41) The debt is unpaid. \nSOR 1.c \u2013 In March 2014, Applicant was evicted from a rental (not alleged in \nthe SOR) because he was behind on the rent. He fell behind because of a loss in \nincome due to his suspended clearance. He appeared in court in June 2014 and \nresolved the judgment in August 2014. He obtained a loan from his retirement account \nand paid the account. In July 2015, he appeared in the same court for a second eviction \n(SOR \u00b6 1.c) after he fell three months behind on rent. He plans on paying this judgment \nwhen he gets a better paying job. (GE 1 at 43; GE 4 at 26; GE 6; Tr. 36-37) The debt is \nunresolved. \nSOR \u00b6 1.d \u2013 Applicant did not pay Federal taxes totaling $37,253 for 2010 \nthrough 2013. He discovered that it was impossible to obtain the Federal account \ntranscripts or reach the IRS, particularly during the COVID pandemic. As with the \ndelinquent debts listed in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1c, his inability to pay occurred because \nof his 2013 suspended clearance. The IRS placed Applicant on a non-collectible status \nbecause he is living at the poverty level according to the Department of Labor. He was \nunable to utilize the advice of the tax advocate service because Applicant and his wife \nbelieved they had been deceived by the tax defense network. They were requesting a \n$204 refund and an email confirming cancellation of their enrollment in the service. (GE \n4 at 2-11, 23, 26; Tr. 22, 27-28; AE C) The taxes are still unpaid. \nWhen the IRS confers a \u201ccurrently non-collectible status\u201d (CNC) on a taxpayer, \nthey are temporally stopping their attempts to collect taxes.

Because of \nhis difficulties in contacting the IRS, particularly during COVID pandemic period, \nApplicant does not know whether the federal taxes, penalties, or liens for 2010 and \n2011 have been extinguished or released. (Tr. 27-28) \nThough unalleged in the SOR, Applicant and his second wife owed taxes for \n2008 and 2009. They were in a payment plan. He claimed that he was not involved in \nher tax issues. The IRS imposed a levy on his income in 2009, and he claims that he \nsatisfied the levy in September 2012. (GE 2 at 33) \nSOR \u00b6 1.e \u2013 Applicant owes $5,200 in state taxes which he has not paid due to \nlow income resulting from a suspended security clearance license and low paying jobs. \nApplicant planned to pay the state taxes once he receives a higher paying job. From \nJuly 2017 to November 2018, he made regular payments of $160 a month. At the end of \nthe payment period, the state notified him that he completed the plan. He claimed that \nhe had documentation proving that he made the payments to the agency. However, the \ndocumentation was in the same storage unit that was auctioned at an unidentified date \nafter he missed a payment. Applicant did not know what he owed the state agency. At a \nsubsequent time, he called the state agency and left a message to set up a small \npayment arrangement, but insufficient funds caused him to change his mind. (Tr. 23-24, \n31-32) \nThough Applicant implied that his financial problems arose after his security \nclearance was suspended in 2013, the record demonstrates that he had financial issues \nbefore he received a conditional security clearance in 2007. Documentation shows that \nOPM had completed their investigation on November 3, 2006. He was granted the \nclearance on condition that he continue payments of five debts in a debt management \nplan. Applicant explained that the financial issues occurred because he was \nexperiencing his first divorce. Further, there were accounts he was not aware of \nbecause he was traveling a majority of the time, and the debts were opened in his \nname. Applicant paid all those debts with a loan from his retirement account. As noted \nearlier, documentation indicates that he also had federal tax issues in 2008 and 2009. \n(GE 7; Tr. 25) \nIn August 2013, Applicant\u2019s security clearance was suspended because he \nfailed to provide documentation related to a personal loan, a car loan, and the Internal \nRevenue Service (IRS). He was provided a 30-day extension. He claimed that because \nhe was working in different buildings, and was deeply involved in an inventory review \nover several months, he forgot to read his emails. His department head informed him \nthat his security clearance was suspended. After the 30-day period had expired, he \nreceived documentation from the IRS, but he received no documentation regarding his \npersonal and auto loans. I do not find his explanation credible. Applicant was placed on \nindefinite suspension for failure to comply with documentation requests.

(GE 1 \nat 40; GE 4 at 19, 25; Tr. 25-30) \nCharacter Evidence \nApplicant indicated that he was not going to seek character statements \nbecause he did not want anyone involved in his security clearance adjudication. (Tr. 43) \nHe did not ask for any character statements from coworkers because they would want \nto know why he needs a character endorsement for a security clearance. He believes \nhe has the respect of those that work with him. His performance evaluation for \nSeptember 21, 2021 to June 2022 received a rating of 3.22, with 5 being the highest \nperformance rating. The rating was signed by his supervisor and next level supervisor. \n(AE A) \nApplicant received a letter of appreciation in 2002 and an award for dedication \nin 2003 while working as a civilian for the U.S. Navy. In 2021 or 2022, he received a \nletter of appreciation while working for his current employer. (AE B) \nAE C contains the May 2021 letter from the tax service based on the state \nsenator\u2019s inquiry into Applicant\u2019s federal tax debt. The letter provided options for \nresolving the SOR \u00b6 1.d federal tax debt. Applicant\u2019s wife submitted a June 15, 2021 \nletter to the money solver organization and the tax service expressing her \ndissatisfaction with the organizations and requesting cancellation of their enrollment and \na refund of payments they made to the tax organizations. \nIn the next exhibit, Applicant provided a leave and earning statement indicating \nthat he has a net income of the $3,007 a month, with expenses of $2,841 a month, \nleaving a monthly remainder of $166 that he applies to savings. He is required to move \nfrom his current residence in December 2023, because the home owner is selling his \ncurrent residence.

These guidelines are \nflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these \nguidelines are applied together with common sense and the general factors of the \nwhole-person concept. The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. The protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 \n2(d) requires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national \nsecurity eligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . ..\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion in seeking a favorable security decision. \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nAG \u00b6 18. Failure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, \nmental health conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or \ndependence. An individual who is financially overextended is at greater \nrisk of having to engage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to \ngenerate funds. Affluence that cannot be explained by known sources of \nincome is also a security concern insofar as it may result from criminal \nactivity, including espionage. \nAG \u00b6 19. Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying include: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; \n(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \n6 \n\n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nA person\u2019s payment of his financial responsibilities is a private matter until \nevidence reveals that he is not paying his debts in a timely fashion. Adverse evidence \nfrom credit reports can usually meet the Government\u2019s obligation of proving delinquent \ndebts. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 14-02403 at 3 (App. Bd. Aug. 18, 2015); ISCR Case \nNo. 03-20327 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, 2006) Applicant\u2019s June 2022 admissions and the \nGovernment\u2019s August 2020 credit report establishes that the listed debts became \ndelinquent between 2010 and February 2013. Applicant\u2019s tax problems surfaced when \nhe did not pay Federal taxes for 2010, and were compounded by Applicant\u2019s failure to \npay additional taxes from 2011 through 2013. His most recent delinquent debt occurred \nin February 2018 when the cable account was transferred for collection. This is the \nsame cable company that is listed in his conditional security clearance determination in \n2007. AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and 19(c) apply. AG \u00b6 19(b) does not apply because Applicant is \nwilling to pay his delinquent debts. \nAG \u00b6 20. Conditions that could mitigate security concerns include: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or \nseparation, clear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity \ntheft), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit \ncredit counseling service, and there are clear indications that the \nproblem is being resolved or is under control; and \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.  \nAG \u00b6 20 (a) does not apply since Applicant still owes the total amount of \ndelinquent debt to the five creditors listed in the SOR. The lack of documented evidence \nto support his claims of trying to pay on four of the five listed creditors continues to raise \ndoubts about his reliability and judgment. \nAG \u00b6 20(b) recognizes that a person\u2019s financial problems can be caused by \nevents beyond his control. Applicant\u2019s suspension from his Federal job in August 2013 \nwas not caused by matters beyond his control, but because he did not comply with the \nrequired documentary requests of his command concerning two loans and federal tax \nissues within the 30-day time period. His lack of compliance was especially serious \n7 \n\n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nbecause he had held a security clearance since 1991, so he should have used better \njudgment in executing his security clearance obligations. While Applicant experienced a \ntwo month period of unemployment in 2016, and a four-year period of underemployment \nat the senior citizen\u2019s organization until 2021, he has been consistently employed since \nDecember 2016. During the period, he reported no medical emergencies, no \nhospitalizations, and no disabilities that would have prevented him from gainful \nemployment. Though his wife suffers from a serious medical condition and has not \nworked in 10 years, there is insufficient evidence to determine how her condition \naffected Applicant\u2019s inability to repay the creditors since their marriage in 2014. \nApplicant receives limited mitigation under the first prong of AG \u00b6 20(b), but no \nmitigation under the second prong because he did not act responsibly in settling the \nother debts. There is no substantiating evidence, i.e., cancelled checks, bank ledgers, \nreceipts, or self-generated documents which establish the listed debts were paid or \nresolved in some manner. Likewise, there is no documented good-faith effort to repay \ncreditors or otherwise resolve debts as required under AG \u00b6 20(d). \nAG \u00b6 20(c) applies when financial counseling demonstrates that there are clear \nindications the financial problems are being resolved or under control. Though Applicant \npresented no evidence of financial counseling, he claimed that he was in a payment \nplan with the IRS and resolved the Federal tax problem in September 2012. In sum, the \nlack of unequivocal documented evidence that the Federal and state taxes are being \nresolved or under control renders AG \u00b6 20(c) is unavailable for mitigation. \nWhole-Person Concept \nI have examined the evidence under the specific guidelines in the context of the \nnine general factors of the whole-person concept listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the \nmotivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, \nexploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or \nrecurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for \naccess to classified information must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon \ncareful consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nApplicant is married and has two adult-aged sons and one adult-aged stepson. \nHe has been recognized for his work contribution in 2002, 2003, and in 2021 or 2022. \n8 \n\n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nHis decision not to obtain character endorsements is based on his belief that the \nauthors would want to know why he needs this this information for a security clearance. \nAfter considering the evidence under the whole-person, the mitigating evidence \nis insufficient to overcome Applicant\u2019s history of financial problems that dates to 2006, \nand his attempts to minimize and deny the negative evidence so that it is viewed in his \nfavor. In his explanation for the conditional security clearance in 2007, he seemed to be \nblaming his former wife for incurring financial problems during the period. He claimed \nthat he was traveling a good deal of the period and several of the delinquent accounts \nwere opened using his name. He claimed that he had nothing to do with the tax \nproblems that emerged in 2008 and 2009.  \nApplicant attributes the reason for the SOR \u00b6 1.a debt to being evicted before \nthe final bill was mailed to him. He could have remedied the lack of a forwarding \naddress by alerting the post office of his dilemma so that he would receive mail at the \npost office after his eviction and until he relocated to another residence. \nClaiming that the SOR \u00b6 1.b creditor recouped the full value of the car after the \nauction with no substantiating documentation other than a letter that was destroyed \nwhen the storage unit was sold, is not worthy of belief. Advancing the same claim \nconcerning the purported payments to the state tax agency is also not credible. \nApplicant has not furnished sufficient evidence to establish that his delinquent \ndebts are being resolved or under control. In Guideline F cases, the DOHA Appeals \nBoard has repeatedly held that, to establish his case in mitigation, an applicant must \npresent a \u201cmeaningful track record\u201d of debt repayments that result in debt reduction. \nSee, e.g., ISCR Case No. 05-01920 at 5 (App. Bd. Mar. 1, 2007) While an applicant is \nnot required to show that every debt listed in the SOR is paid, the applicant must show \nthat he has a plan for debt resolution and has taken significant action to implement the \nplan. This includes any self-generated efforts to keep listed creditors aware of the \nreasons why an applicant is unable to address his delinquent debts. See, e.g., ISCR \nCase No. 02-25499 at 2 (App. Bd. Jun. 5, 2006). From the record presented, Applicant \nhas no plan in place and has furnished no evidence of even sporadic payments on the \npast due accounts. After a full review of the entire record from an overall common-\nsense point of view, Applicant\u2019s ongoing financial problems have not been mitigated.   \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.e:  \nAgainst Applicant \n9 \n\n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_________________ \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for access to \nclassified information.

His admissions are incorporated into the findings of fact. After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings and evidence submitted, I make the following additional findings of fact. Applicant is 53 years old. He was married in 2003 and has four adult children. He has worked as a cyber systems engineer since 2020. He was voluntarily unemployed for about five months in 2019, so that he could move and take care of a sick relative. He has otherwise been employed since 2007. (Items 3, 4) In his SOR Answer, Applicant stated that his financial problems originated when his disabled wife was ill, and he was focused on her health. He stated that during this time he lost his job, his mother-in-law passed away, and that they took care of his father-in- law, who had cancer and depression. He did not specify what time period that these events occurred. He stated that when he became reemployed, he was earning less than in his previous job. In February 2022, he stated that he was focused on cleaning up his credit, and that his delinquent student loans were his first priority.

Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nStatement of the Case \nApplicant submitted a security clearance application (SCA) on May 14, 2020. On \nOctober 18, 2021, the Defense Counterintelligence and Security Agency Consolidated \nAdjudication Services (DCSA CAS) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant \ndetailing security concerns under Guideline F (financial considerations) and Guideline E \n(personal conduct). He responded to the SOR on February 28, 2022, and requested a \ndecision by an administrative judge from the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals \n(DOHA) based on the administrative (written) record in lieu of a hearing. \nOn October 14, 2022, Department Counsel submitted the Government\u2019s file of \nrelevant material (FORM) including Items 1-13. A complete copy of the FORM was \nprovided to Applicant, who was afforded an opportunity to file objections and submit \nmaterial to refute, extenuate, or mitigate the security concerns.

Items 1 and 2 \nare the SOR and Applicant\u2019s Answer, which are the pleadings in the case. Items 3-13 and \nAE A-D are admitted without objection. \nFindings of Fact \nIn his Answer, Applicant admitted all the Guideline F allegations (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.i), \nand denied the Guideline E allegations (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.a-2.b). His admissions are incorporated \ninto the findings of fact. After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings and evidence \nsubmitted, I make the following additional findings of fact. \nApplicant is 53 years old. He was married in 2003 and has four adult children. He \nhas worked as a cyber systems engineer since 2020. He was voluntarily unemployed for \nabout five months in 2019, so that he could move and take care of a sick relative. He has \notherwise been employed since 2007. (Items 3, 4) \nIn his SOR Answer, Applicant stated that his financial problems originated when \nhis disabled wife was ill, and he was focused on her health. He stated that during this time \nhe lost his job, his mother-in-law passed away, and that they took care of his father-in-\nlaw, who had cancer and depression. He did not specify what time period that these \nevents occurred. He stated that when he became reemployed, he was earning less than \nin his previous job. In February 2022, he stated that he was focused on cleaning up his \ncredit, and that his delinquent student loans were his first priority. He claimed that he \nbrought his student loans current, which are not alleged in the SOR, and that he was \nworking to resolve his other delinquent debts. He reported that his goal was to have his \ndelinquent debts resolved by the end of 2022. (Item 2)  \nIn his Answer, Applicant addressed the falsification allegations by asserting that \nhe thought that he only had to update the information on his SCA if there had been a \nchange. He stated that after his 2017 SCA, he was granted a security clearance in 2019. \nSince his 2020 SCA had been completed about a year after receiving his clearance, and \nhis financial situation was the same, he claimed that he did not think that he needed to \nreport it again. However, he did not report any financial delinquencies in his June 2017 \nSCA, and he failed to report any in his May 2020 SCA. He stated in his Answer that he \nwas not aware that financial issues had been left off his SCA. (Answer; Items 2, 3, 4) \nIn his March 2018 background interview with a government investigator, he \nvoluntarily disclosed his delinquent student loans, a temporary vehicle repossession in \n2017, a short sale of his home in 2017, a charged-off credit card, and medical bills in \ncollection. He was confronted with other delinquent debts. He claims that he did not report \nthese debts on his 2017 SCA because of an oversight. He also reported in this interview \nthat 2012 was when his wife\u2019s illness started to impact their finances, and that he hoped \nto resolve his financial delinquencies by the end of 2018. (Item 7) \nIn his April 2019 background interview, Applicant stated that his financial situation \nwas getting better, but that his wife\u2019s medical expenses still impacted his ability to pay \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ndebt.

(Item 6) \nIn his July 2020 background interview, he did not voluntarily disclose any financial \ndelinquencies, and was confronted by the investigator about his delinquent debt. He \nclaimed that he did not list any debts on his 2020 SCA because of an oversight. He \nclaimed that his financial situation was good and that he was slowly paying off his \ndelinquent debt. (Item 5)    \nThe SOR alleges nine delinquent debts totaling about $19,000 and two SCA \nfalsification allegations. The debt includes about $15,800 of charged-off consumer debt, \n$2,400 of debt in collection, and $500 of medical debt in collection. The SOR also alleges \nfalsification of his 2017 and 2020 SCA. The status of the allegations are as follows: \nSOR \u00b6 1.a is an account that was charged off in May 2017 for $12,346. Applicant \nreported that this account was used to purchase a motorcycle. He stated that when he \nhad financial difficulties, he was unable to afford the payments. He claimed that the \naccount had been charged off before he could resume payments. He did not provide any \ndocumentation showing that he has taken any action on this debt, and it remains \nunresolved. (Answer; Items 10, 11) \nSOR \u00b6 1.b is a credit card that was charged off in August 2016 for $2,452. \nApplicant provided a receipt with his answer showing that this account was paid in \nSeptember 2021. This debt is resolved. (Answer; Items 10, 11) \nSOR \u00b6 1.c a is a credit card that was charged off in July 2016 for $985. In his \nAnswer, Applicant claimed that he was working to resolve this debt by the end of 2021. \nHe did not provide any documentation showing that he has taken any action on this debt, \nand it remains unresolved. (Answer; Items 10, 11) \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d, 1.f, 1.g, and 1.h are medical accounts in collection totaling $530. \nApplicant claimed that Medicare was supposed to pay 1.d, and that the others went to \ncollection before he could resolve them. In his Answer, he stated that he would resolve \nthese debts by the end of 2021. He did not provide any documentation showing that he \nhas taken any action on these medical debts, and they remain unresolved. (Answer; Items \n10, 11) \nSOR \u00b6 1.e is a utility account that has been placed for collection for $171. The date \nof last activity on this account was February 2017. Applicant claimed that this was a cable \nbill, and when he moved, the new company was supposed to pay the transfer fees. In his \nAnswer, he stated that he forgot about this debt but would pay it by the end of 2021. In \nJune 2023, he claimed that he recently had paid this debt over the phone and did not \nhave a receipt. (Answer; Items 10, 11) \nSOR \u00b6 1.i is a mortgage account from 2017 with an outstanding balance of $2,096. \nApplicant claimed that he was not aware that there was a remaining balance on this \naccount.

(Answer; Items 10, 11) \nSOR \u00b6 2.a alleges that Applicant falsified his May 2020 SCA by failing to report \nany of his delinquent debts in \u201cSection 26 \u2013 Financial Record \u2013 Delinquency Involving \nRoutine Accounts\u201d. In his Answer, he denied the allegation, and stated that all of the debts \nwere listed in his SCA for his most recent clearance application, so he believed that he \ndid not need to address them again. The record shows that Applicant did not list any \ndelinquent debts on his 2017 SCA, but he discussed them in his background interview. \nHe volunteered the information in his 2018 interview. He did not volunteer any financial \ninformation in his 2020 interview and was confronted with the debts by the investigator. \nSOR \u00b6 2.b alleges that Applicant falsified his June 2017 SCA by failing to report \nany of his delinquent debts in \u201cSection 26 \u2013 Financial Record \u2013 Delinquency Involving \nRoutine Accounts\u201d. In his Answer, he denied the allegation, and stated that all of the debts \nwere listed in his SCA for his most recent clearance, so he believed that he did not need \nto address them again. There is no documentation in the record that Applicant had \nsubmitted an SCA or had a background investigation that was close in time and prior to \n2017, where he could assert that he had previously reported this information to \ninvestigators. The record shows that he voluntarily provided information about his \nfinancial situation in his 2018 background interview before the investigator raised specific \naccounts. \nIn June 2023, I gave Applicant the chance to submit additional documentation \nshowing that he has paid or is paying any of the debts alleged in the SOR. This \ndocumentation was not provided. Applicant submitted three credit reports (AE B-D), which \nshow that he did not have any new financial delinquencies. He stated that these three \ncredit reports show that he has worked to take care of negative items on the reports, and \nthat most items were resolved by submitting disputes through the credit agencies. \nApplicant admitted all of the SOR debts, and he did not provide specific information about \nwhy he would dispute any of these debts with the credit reporting agencies. He did not \nstate that he had paid any of these debts except for the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b and \n1.e. His recent credit reports also show that he purchased a $53,000 automobile in May \n2022. (AE A-D).  \nApplicant did not provide any other documentation concerning his current financial \nsituation, such as his monthly income and expenses, and his assets. He did not provide \nevidence showing that he has received credit counseling or maintains a monthly budget. \n(Answer; AE A-D). \nPolicies \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG), which became \neffective on June 8, 2017. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n      \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in conjunction \nwith the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation of potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds.  \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an individual might knowingly \ncompromise classified information in order to raise money. It encompasses concerns \nabout an individual\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting \nclassified information. An individual who is financially irresponsible may also be \nirresponsible, unconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified \ninformation. ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(b) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nThe SOR allegations evidencing Applicant\u2019s history of financial delinquencies are \nestablished by his admissions and the credit reports in the record. AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and 19(c) \napply. \nConditions that could mitigate the financial considerations security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 20. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear\nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(a) does not apply. Applicant failed to provide sufficient evidence showing \nthat any of the SOR debts, other than SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b and 1.e, are resolved or being paid, or \nthat they became delinquent under circumstances that are unlikely to recur. He recently \npaid \u00b6 1.e after the record reopened, which had been delinquent since 2017. This late \npayment activity is not fully mitigating. Applicant also failed to provide sufficient \ndocumentation of his current financial situation, or evidence which might otherwise \nestablish his ability to address his debts responsibly. His failure to pay his delinquent debt \nis recent, ongoing, and not isolated. His failure to meet his financial obligations continues \nto cast doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. \nAG \u00b6 20(b) partially applies. While his wife\u2019s illness and medical expenses were \nbeyond his control, he failed to provide sufficient evidence that he acted responsibly under \nthe circumstances. He was also voluntarily unemployed for five months in 2019, which \nimpacted his finances. AG \u00b6 20(b) does not fully apply. \nAG \u00b6 20(d) partially applies. It applies to the debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.b because \nApplicant resolved that debt in September 2021 prior to submitting his SCA. It does not \napply to the debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.e because his recent resolution of this long-standing \ndebt does not constitute a good faith effort to repay the creditor. The timing of Applicant\u2019s \nrepayment of delinquent debts, impact upon the degree to which the mitigating factors \napply. See, ISCR Case No. 08-06058 at 3 (App. Bd. Sep. 21, 2009). Despite repeated \nassurances that he was resolving his delinquent debt, he did not provide sufficient \ndocumentation of payment arrangements, payments made, or resolution of any of the \nremaining SOR debts. \nAG \u00b6 20(e) does not apply. Applicant claims that he resolved his remaining debts \nthrough disputes with the credit reporting agencies. However, he did not provide sufficient \ndocumentation to substantiate the basis for the dispute, and he admitted all of the SOR \ndebts in his Answer. He did not show that any of the SOR debts had been successfully \nchallenged. The fact that a debt no longer appears on a credit report does not establish \nany meaningful, independent evidence as to the disposition of the debt. ISCR Case No. \n14- 03612 at 3 (App. Bd. Aug. 15, 2015). The absence of unsatisfied debts from an \napplicant\u2019s credit report does not extenuate or mitigate a history of financial difficulties or \nconstitute evidence of financial reform or rehabilitation. ISCR Case No. 15-02957 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Feb. 17, 2017). \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \nAG \u00b6 15 details the personal conduct security concern: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes\u2026 \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nI have considered the 2017 and 2020 SCA falsification allegations under AG \u00b6 16 \nand the following is potentially applicable: \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from  \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar \nform used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, \naward benefits or status, determine national security eligibility or \ntrustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities; \nThere is sufficient evidence in the record of a deliberate omission, concealment, \nor falsification of relevant facts from a personnel security questionnaire. AG \u00b6\u00b6 16 (a) \napplies. \nI have considered the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 17. The following are \npotentially applicable: \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; and \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment. \nAlthough Applicant failed to provide information about his delinquent debts on his \n2017 SCA, he did volunteer that information to the investigator in his 2018 background \ninterview. In his 2020 SCA, he did not provide information about his delinquent debts on \nthe SCA, and he did not volunteer that information to the investigator before being \nconfronted with it. While he claimed in his Answer that he thought he did not need to \ninclude the information again on his 2020 SCA, he had not included it on his 2017 SCA \neither. This explanation is not credible. I find that his failure to report delinquent financial \ninformation in his 2020 SCA was a deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of \nrelevant facts. AG \u00b6 17(a) only applies to \u00b6 2.b . \nAG \u00b6 17(c) does not apply. Providing false or misleading information; or concealing \nor omitting information concerning relevant facts is not minor. There is insufficient \nevidence to find mitigation by the passage of time, the behavior is infrequent, or that it \nhappened under such unique circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on his reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the potentially \ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and circumstances \nsurrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under Guidelines F and E in my \nwhole-person analysis. \nApplicant did not request a hearing, I did not have the opportunity to question him \nabout his financial issues, his failure to report financial information on his 2017 and 2020 \nSCAs, or to assess his credibility by observing his demeanor. Overall, the record evidence \nleaves me with questions and doubts about Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a \nsecurity clearance. Applicant did not provide sufficient evidence to mitigate the security \nconcerns arising out of his delinquent debts under Guideline F, and his falsification of his \n2020 SCA under Guideline E. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 1.a: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.b: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.c-1.i: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 2.a: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 2.b: \nFor Applicant \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nConclusion \nIt is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for \na security clearance.

(GE 1; Tr. 15, 66-80, 93-94) The SOR alleges nine delinquent accounts totaling $79,896. In her Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.h with explanations, but denied the allegation in SOR \u00b6 1.i. Applicant attributes her financial problems to divorce, her former husband\u2019s unemployment, marital debt, child-support costs, and unanticipated medical expenses. She said that after her former husband lost his job and left her without a home or a reliable car, she prioritized her debts. She rented two homes to pay the mortgages and moved into an inexpensive apartment, entered payment arrangements with other creditors, obtained and has timely paid auto loans for her and her daughter, worked part-time to earn extra income, and used loans from her retirement account to pay some bills.

(GE 3 at 18, GE 4 at 3, GE 5 at 9) She testified the \ncreditor closed four credit card accounts when she defaulted on one account, that she \npaid the debt off in 2022, was later permitted to reopen a credit card account, and has \nmade timely payments since.

(GE 3 at 19, GE 4 at 4, GE 5 at 17; AE I at 15; Tr. 39-41, 75-76) \nSOR \u00b6 1.h: credit account charged off for $33,613. Applicant admitted the debt \nbut said the balance due was incorrect because she had made weekly payments since \n2018 in accordance with an agreement. (Answer; Tr. 57-58, 77-78) She submitted \ndocumentary evidence of weekly, $50 payments from October 2018 to October 25, 2023, \nand an account balance of $25,640, as of October 25, 2023. (AE D at 2-3, 12-16, AE I at \n16, AE J) This debt is being resolved.  \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.i: credit account charged off for $416. Applicant denied the allegation \nand said the debt was not hers. (Answer) Credit reports from July 2020 and May 2021 \nshow an individual credit-card account was opened or assigned in April 2017, charged off \nwith a balance of $416, and transferred or sold to another creditor. (GE 3 at 20, GE 4 at \n5) A February 2022 credit report shows that an account opened the same month with a \nsimilar account number, but different creditor, was charged off for $416, and transferred \nor sold with a balance of $0. (GE 5 at 16) She testified she did not recognize the debt or \ncreditor, that the debt was not listed in her credit reports, and that she contacted the \ncreditor and was told they had no records of a debt associated with her social security \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nnumber. (Tr. 57-58, 79; AE D at 3, AE I at 1) I resolve this allegation for Applicant because \nher testimony is corroborated, in part, by documentary evidence.  \nApplicant\u2019s financial situation has apparently improved. She reported a gross \nannual income of about $145,000 including salary and bonuses. She has about $10,000 \nin her bank accounts and about $50,000 in a retirement account. She has two homes in \nher name with current mortgages and at least $133,000 in equity. She has not received \nformal financial counseling. She submitted a spreadsheet she uses to track expenses \nand a written budget. (Answer; GE 1-3; AE B, AE I; Tr. 81-101) \nApplicant submitted a letter of recommendation from a friend and fellow social \norganization executive that comments favorably on her sincerity, trustworthiness, \nreliability, judgment, loyalty, and ethical standards. (AE I at 6-7) \nPolicies \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines (AG). These guidelines are not inflexible \nrules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines \nare applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative \njudge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable. \n\u201cThe applicant is responsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, \nexplain, extenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department \nCounsel, and has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance \ndecision.\u201d Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating \nthat it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security \nclearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance \ndeterminations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Department of the Navy \nv. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988); see AG \u00b6 2(b). \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. Under AG \n\u00b6 2(b), any doubt \u201cwill be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d Section 7 of EO 10865 \nprovides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \na determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section \n3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information).  \nAnalysis \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nThe security concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. . . .  \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified or sensitive information to raise money. It encompasses concerns \nabout a person\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting \nclassified or sensitive information. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be \nirresponsible, unconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified or \nsensitive information. See ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \nThe record evidence, including credit reports and Applicant\u2019s statements, establish \ntwo disqualifying conditions under this guideline: AG \u00b6 19(a) (\u201cinability to satisfy debts\u201d) \nand AG \u00b6 19(c) (\u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations\u201d). The following mitigating \nconditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control;  \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue. \nThe SOR alleges nine delinquent accounts totaling $79,896 and Applicant has \nresolved, is resolving, or successfully disputed eight debts totaling $55,254. In October \n2018, she entered a payment plan for the largest debt (SOR \u00b6 1.h) and has reduced the \nbalance from $33,613 to $25,640. She resolved two debts totaling $2,212 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.e, \n1.g) before the SOR was issued. She entered payment plans for four debts totaling \n$19,013 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b-1.d, 1.f) before the SOR was issued and has resolved all four debts. \nShe successfully disputed a $416 debt (SOR \u00b61.i). The $24,642 debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 \n1.a is unresolved, but she has a plan to address it and has applied for a loan to do so.  \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a), 20(b), and 20(d) are established. Applicant\u2019s divorce, former \nhusband\u2019s unemployment, assumption of most marital debt, child support costs, and \nmedical expenses were beyond her control. She acted responsibly by prioritizing her \nfinancial obligations, reducing her expenses, and has resolved or is resolving seven debts \ntotaling $54,838. (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b-1.h). While one large debt remains unresolved (SOR \u00b6 \n1.a), she recently implemented a plan to address it. \nThe adjudicative guidelines do not require that an applicant make payments on all \ndelinquent debts simultaneously, pay debts alleged in the SOR first, or resolve every debt \nalleged in the SOR. An applicant need only establish a plan to resolve financial problems \nand take significant actions to implement the plan. See ISCR Case No. 07-06482 at 2-3 \n(App. Bd. May 21, 2008). Although Applicant\u2019s financial records and finances are not \nperfect, she has implemented a plan to resolve her financial problems and has made \nsubstantial progress in doing so, she understands the importance of continued financial \nresponsibility, and the behavior that resulted in her financial problems is unlikely to recur. \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 20(c) does not apply because she has not received financial counseling.  \nAG \u00b6 20(e) is established for the debt alleged in SOR \u00b61.i. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n              \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nI have incorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis \nand applied the adjudicative factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). I considered the entire record, including \nApplicant\u2019s work and security clearance history, and that her financial problems were \ncaused by circumstances beyond her control. I also considered her debt resolution efforts, \ncharacter evidence, and her understanding of the importance of financially responsible \nbehavior. \nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under Guideline F and \nevaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has \nmitigated the financial security concerns. Overall, the record evidence leaves me with no \nquestions and doubts as to her eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a - 1.i: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nI conclude that it is clearly consistent with the national security interests of the \nUnited States to grant Applicant eligibility for access to classified information.

He married his first wife in 1992 (ex-wife). They divorced in 2013. \nHe has been married to his second wife since 2015 (wife). His two minor children reside \nwith him and his wife. He is not obligated by a court or otherwise to provide financial \nsupport to his adult children. He graduated from high school in 1989. He earned a \nprofessional certificate in 2005. He worked full time as a professional singer from \napproximately 2000 to March 2020, when the COVID-19 pandemic shut down the \nindustry. Since approximately August 2011, he has also been employed full time by an \nindependent government agency (IGA). He submitted the SCA in connection with an offer \nof employment by the defense contractor who sponsored his SCA, pending the successful \nadjudication of his clearance. (GE 1-2; Tr. 10, 15-19, 32) \nUnder Guideline F, the SOR alleged Applicant failed to timely file his federal and \nstate income tax returns and pay his federal and his state taxes for tax years (TY) 2017 \nthrough 2020. Under Guideline E, the SOR alleged he falsified the SCA by deliberately \nfailing to disclose the federal and state tax issues alleged under Guideline F. He admitted \nall allegations in his response to the SOR. (Answer) \nAt the hearing, Applicant admitted he had neither completed nor filed his federal \nand state income tax returns for TY 2017 through 2018 and TY 2020 through 2021. He \nclaimed, without proffering corroborating documentation, that he filed a \u201clow-earner\u201d \nincome tax return with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) for TY 2019. He also admitted \nthat he has not made any direct payments to either the IRS or his state for TY 2017 \nthrough 2021 income taxes. He anticipated he owes the IRS and his state for TY 2017 \nthrough 2021 income taxes, in amounts to be determined. He testified that he intended \nto file his TY 2022 income taxes in a timely manner. I will consider the unalleged TY 2021 \nfederal and state tax issues for the purpose of evaluating mitigation and the whole-person \nconcept. (Tr. 21, 24, 37, 42) \nApplicant also failed to timely file his federal and state income tax returns in \nprevious tax years. In 2016, he filed his federal and income tax returns for four unspecified \nTY he could not recall, which resulted in him owing federal taxes totaling approximately \n$8,000, and state taxes totaling approximately $2,000.

(Tr. 21-24, 38, 40-41) \nAt the hearing, Applicant acknowledged he failed to prioritize resolving his tax \nissues, despite being contacted by the IRS in the past regarding his unfiled income tax \nreturns. He did not specify the dates when he was contacted by the IRS, but he denied \nthe IRS has contacted him recently. He denied being contacted at any time by his state \nregarding his unfiled state income tax returns. (GE 1 at 52-53; GE 2 at 8; Tr. 39-41) \nApplicant and his wife file separate income tax returns.

He \ndoes not manage his finances with a written budget, nor has he sought financial \ncounseling. He reported scant details and provided no documents about his assets and \nmonthly expenses. He reported only one asset: an IGA retirement savings with an \nunknown balance. He asserted that he has no money in savings and very little remaining \nat the end of each month.

(GE 2; \nTr. 33-35, 37, 41, 45, 48-50) \nAt the hearing, Applicant disclosed that he was in the process of filing for Chapter \n13 bankruptcy protection, as he is not eligible for Chapter 7 bankruptcy. He did not \nindicate the amount or nature of the debts he intends to include in the bankruptcy. He \nalso revealed that, for an unspecified period, he has been playing shows as a musician \nto help pay his debts. He did not address the amount of income he has earned in this \nendeavor.

He claimed that an unrecalled relative, who either held or previously held a \nsecurity clearance, advised him not to disclose his federal and state tax issues on his \nSCA, because he could explain those issues during his interview. (GE 2) \nPolicies \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG), which became \neffective on June 8, 2017. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in conjunction \nwith the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation of potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nThe concern under Guideline F (Financial considerations) is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds . . . .   \nApplicant\u2019s admissions and the documentary evidence establish the following \ndisqualifying conditions under AG \u00b6 19: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired. \nApplicant admitted in his Answer he did not file his federal and state income tax \nreturns for at least TY 2017 through 2021, as required. In his response to interrogatories \nand at the hearing, he indicated he filed a \u201clow-earner\u201d income tax return with the IRS and \nhis state for TY 2019. Although he did not produce corroborating documentation, I find \nthat this status is consistent with other evidence in the record. Therefore, I find in \nApplicant\u2019s favor for TY 2019 in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a - 1.d. \nAG \u00b6 20 describes conditions that could mitigate security concerns. The following \nare potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or  \notherwise resolve debts; and \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority \nto file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \nApplicant\u2019s financial and tax issues are current, ongoing, and substantial. He \nadmitted in his Answer he did not file his federal and state income tax returns for at least \nTY 2017 through 2021, as required. At the hearing, Applicant acknowledged he expects \nto owe money for his TY 2017 through 2021 federal and state income taxes, he has not \nyet determined the amounts. While circumstances beyond his control may have \ncontributed to his financial and tax issues, he failed to provide evidence that he has acted \nresponsibly to resolve them. There is no evidence that he has initiated any action, \nincluding contacting a tax professional, the IRS, or his state, to resolve his tax issues. \nOverall, Applicant has not demonstrated any good-faith efforts to address and \nresolve his tax issues in a timely manner. He is credited with resolving one of the three \nunalleged credit-card debts and making payments toward the second. Even without \nspecific details, his intent to file bankruptcy and two unresolved credit-card debts suggest \nongoing indebtedness concerns. The record indicates that he plans to resolve any \nexisting or future indebtedness by making payments either directly or through a Chapter \n13 bankruptcy plan. Considering the record as a whole, including his prior history of failing \nto timely file his returns and recent wage garnishment, I am unable to conclude that his \ntax issues and indebtedness are unlikely to recur or no longer cast doubts about his \nreliability, trustworthiness, and judgment. Mitigation under AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a), 20(b), 20(d), and \n20(g) was not established. \nGuideline E: Personal Conduct \nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the security concern pertaining to personal conduct: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. The following will normally result in \nan unfavorable national security eligibility determination, security clearance \naction, or cancellation of further processing for national security eligibility: \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(a) refusal, or failure without reasonable cause, to undergo or \ncooperate with security processing, including but not limited \nto meeting with a security investigator for subject interview, \ncompleting security forms or releases, cooperation with \nmedical \nor \npsychological \nevaluation, \nor \npolygraph \nexamination, if authorized and required; and \n(b) refusal to provide full, frank, and truthful answers to lawful \nquestions of investigators, security officials, or other official \nrepresentatives in connection with a personnel security or \ntrustworthiness determination. \nAG \u00b6 16 describes the following condition that could raise a security concern and \nbe disqualifying in this case: \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification or relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar \nform used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, \naward \nbenefits \nor \nstatus, \ndetermine \nnational \nsecurity \neligibility \ntrustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities. \nAG \u00b6 16 (a) is established. Applicant admitted in his Answer he deliberately failed \nto disclose his federal and state income tax returns for TY 2017 through 2018 on his SCA. \nFor the reasons stated above, I find that Applicant did not deliberately falsify his SCA \nregarding his TY 2019 income tax returns. Additionally, his TY 2020 income tax returns \nwere not due, nor did he owe the IRS money when he completed his SCA. I find SOR \u00b6 \n2.a in Applicant\u2019s favor for TY 2019 and 2020.  \nAG \u00b6 17 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns raised under this \nguideline. Four of those conditions are potentially applicable: \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, \nunreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to \nrecur; and  \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate vulnerability \nto exploitation, manipulation, or duress. \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant deliberately omitted his extensive history of untimely filed tax returns on \nhis SCA. The mitigation accorded to his voluntary subsequent disclosure (17(a) during \nhis February 2021 interview is undermined by his failure to proffer a reasonable excuse \nfor his SCA omission. He failed to corroborate the alleged advice of a relative he claimed \nto have relied upon regarding his SCA omission. He also raised concerns about his \ncredibility by claiming not to recall the alleged relative. Moreover, the record suggests that \nhis SCA omission may also been motivated, at least in part, by his desire to obtain a \nposition with a higher salary, which requires a security clearance. I have ongoing \nconcerns regarding his reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. Mitigation was not \nestablished under AG \u00b6 17. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the potentially \ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and circumstances \nsurrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under Guidelines F and E in my \nwhole-person analysis. Applicant failed to timely file his federal and state income tax \nreturns for TY 2017, 2018, 2020, and 2021, and he deliberately failed to disclose TY 2017 \nand 2018 on his SCA. He also failed to file for one or more tax years prior to 2016 and for \nTY 2020 and 2021. Overall, he has not demonstrated the actions of a responsible, \nreliable, and trustworthy person. I conclude he did not meet his burden of proof and \npersuasion. He failed to mitigate the security concerns. \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n__________________________ \nFormal Findings \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a - 1.d: \nAgainst Applicant (For Applicant for tax \nyear 2020) \nParagraph 2, Guideline E: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 2.a: \nAgainst Applicant (For Applicant for tax \nyear 2020) \nConclusion \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national interest of the United \nStates to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nEligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nCAROLINE E.

Clearance is granted. \nStatement of the Case \nOn October 17, 2021, the Department of Defense Counterintelligence and Security \nAgency Consolidated Adjudications Services (DCSA CAS) issued an SOR to Applicant \ndetailing security concerns under Guideline F, financial considerations, explaining why it \nwas unable to find it clearly consistent with the national security to grant security \nclearance eligibility. The DCSA CAS took the action under Executive Order (EO) 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; \nDOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program \n(January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the National Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) \neffective for any adjudication made on or after June 8, 2017. On October 27, 2021, \nApplicant answered the SOR. She admitted subparagraphs 1.a through 1.h, admitted in \npart, and denied, in part, subparagraphs 1.i through 1.l, and denied subparagraphs 1.m \nthrough 1.q. She requested a decision on the record evidence instead of a hearing. \n1 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nOn February 23, 2022, Department Counsel prepared a File of Relevant Material \n(FORM) containing a brief supported by seven exhibits.

At some \ntime that is not clear from the record, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals \nconverted the case to a pending hearing status. The case was assigned to another \nadministrative judge on May 13, 2022. After being rescheduled twice, the case was \nassigned to me on August 11, 2023 and scheduled for September 26, 2023. \nI held the case as rescheduled, incorporating seven government exhibits \n(Government Exhibit (GE) 1- 7) and one Applicant exhibit (Applicant Exhibit (AE) A), \ntogether with the testimony of one character witness. At the end of the hearing, I extended \nthe record until October 20, 2023, to allow Applicant the opportunity to submit additional \nexhibits. Within the time allotted, she submitted five exhibits incorporated into the record \nas AE B through AE F. The transcript was received on October 6, 2023. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant is a 38-year-old single woman with two children, ages 13 and 5. She \ngraduated from college in 2009 after which, she worked in a number of different fields, \nincluding as a medical assistant and as a teacher. During a four-month period in 2013, \nshe worked fulltime as a teacher and parttime as a waitress while enrolled in vocational \nschool. (GE 1 at 14, 18) In 2018, she began working for a defense contractor in the parts \nassembly division. \nApplicant incurred approximately $32,000 of delinquent student loan debts, as \nalleged in subparagraphs 1.a through 1.f, 1.h, and 1.n. (AE B) A single mother, Applicant \nattributes her problems keeping up with her student loan payments to difficulty supporting \nher two children, one of whom has special needs, with inconsistent financial support from \nthe children\u2019s fathers. (Tr. 49-50) In 2020, Applicant contacted the student loan creditor \nfor help refinancing the loans. After the creditor conducted an income and expense \nanalysis, Applicant\u2019s monthly payments were reduced to $5.00 per month. (AE B at 1-3) \nApplicant has been paying this amount as agreed. The accounts are currently in good \nstanding. (AE B at 4; GE 6 at 3-6) \nIn 2015, Applicant\u2019s commercial debts began to fall behind after her live-in \nboyfriend broke up with her and stopped making payments towards a motorcycle loan \nthat she had financed. Applicant subsequently discovered that her ex-boyfriend had been \nopening credit card accounts in her name without her knowledge while they were living \ntogether, \u201ckeeping it hidden,\u201d and had been continuing to abuse her credit after they had \nseparated. (Tr. 22; GE 7 at 1) By 2020, the commercial debt that appeared on Applicant\u2019s \ncredit report totaled $14,000, as alleged in subparagraphs 1.a through 1.f, 1.h and 1.n. \nApplicant then asked her father for help. He allowed her and the two children to \nmove into his home so that she could stabilize her financial situation. (Tr. 22) After moving \nin with her father, Applicant then went to the police department to report the identity theft. \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAfter finding them to be unhelpful, she closed all the accounts and retained an attorney \nwho has been helping her identify and remove these accounts from her credit record. (Tr. \n35) \nThe debt alleged in SOR subparagraph 1.g, totaling $2,593, is the motorcycle that \nApplicant\u2019s ex-boyfriend stopped making loan payments after they separated. Applicant \ncontacted the creditor, informed it of what happened, whereupon the creditor \nrepossessed it. (AE C) The creditor told Applicant that she was responsible for the \ndeficiency. (AE C) Applicant disputed this contention and is seeking its removal from her \ncredit report. (AE A at 2) With the help of Applicant\u2019s attorney, all the debts alleged in \nsubparagraph 1.i through 1.o and 1.q have been removed from her credit report. (AE A) \nApplicant satisfied the debt alleged in subparagraph 1.p, totaling $363. (Answer at 6) \nApplicant is now vigilant about managing her finances. In June 2019, she \ncompleted an employer-sponsored financial management course and in 2021, she took \na course on how to satisfy outstanding debt. (AE E) In addition, she routinely watches \nfinancial self-help videos. (AE F) \nPolicies \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion the Executive \nBranch has in regulating access to information pertaining to national security, \nemphasizing that \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy \nv. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). When evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security \nclearance, the administrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are required to be \nconsidered in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of \nhuman behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the \nadjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overall adjudicative goal is a fair, \nimpartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a \nconscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d \nThe administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the \nperson, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 1(d) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present \nevidence to establish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, \nthe applicant is responsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, \nexplain, extenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department \nCounsel. . ..\u201d The applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable \nsecurity decision. \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must consider the \ntotality of an applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant circumstances in light of the nine\nadjudicative process factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). They are as follows: \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; \n \n(2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; \n(3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; \n(4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; \n(5) the extent to which participation is voluntary; \n(6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent \nbehavioral changes; \n(7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and \n(9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nAnalysis \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nUnder this concern, \u201cfailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to \nabide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about an individual\u2019s \nreliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified or sensitive information.\u201d (AG \u00b6 \n18)  \nApplicant\u2019s history of struggling to pay her student loan debts on time, together \nwith multiple debts that are listed as delinquent on her credit bureau reports, triggers the \napplication of AG \u00b6 19(a), \u201cinability to satisfy debts,\u201d and AG \u00b6 19(c), \u201ca history of not \nmeeting financial obligations.\u201d Applicant\u2019s ex-boyfriend incurred the majority of the \ncommercial delinquent debt in her name without her knowledge, or in the case of the \nmotorcycle loan that Applicant did open, ceasing to make payments after they separated. \nOnce Applicant discovered these problems, she retained an attorney. With the attorney\u2019s \nhelp, she identified all the accounts that the boyfriend opened, contacted the credit \nreporting agencies, and had them removed from her credit reports. As for the student loan \naccounts, she renegotiated the payment amount and has complied with the renegotiated \nloan terms. Currently, they are no longer delinquent. \nApplicant is no longer in touch with her ex-boyfriend, making the possibility of \nrecurrence unlikely. She attended a financial counseling course through her employer, \nand she routinely watches financial self-help videos to help her keep abreast of her \nfinances. I conclude that the following mitigating conditions are applicable: \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n20(a) the behavior . . . . occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely \nto recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability,\ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n20(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce, or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n20(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the\nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; and \n \n20(d) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue. \nOn balance, I conclude Applicant mitigated the financial considerations security concerns. \nWhole-Person Concept \nI considered the whole-person factors in my analysis of the disqualifying and \nmitigating conditions, particularly, the circumstances surrounding the origin of the problem \nand the current, significant presence of rehabilitation.  \nFindings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.q: \nFor Applicant \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n_____________________ \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly \nconsistent with the interests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

Eligibility for \nsecurity clearance access is denied. \nStatement of the Case \nOn December 14, 2020, Applicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaire for \nInvestigations Processing (e-QIP, Item 3) for security clearance eligibility so that he \ncould work for a defense contractor. On November 9, 2021, the Defense \nCounterintelligence Security Agency (DCSA) could not make the necessary affirmative \nfinding to grant Applicant\u2019s security clearance and issued a Statement of Reasons \n(SOR) to him detailing security reasons under the financial considerations guideline \n(Guideline F).

He \nreceived the FORM on May 17, 2023. The Government advised Applicant that, in his \nresponse, he could either file objections, furnish explanations, submit additional \nmaterial, or take advantage of all three options within 30 days of receiving the FORM. \nDOHA received Applicant\u2019s response (statement) to the SOR on June 30, 2023. On July \n3, 2023, Department counsel indicated that he did not object to Applicant\u2019s statement. \nThe case file was assigned to me on September 28, 2023. \nFindings of Fact \nThe SOR contains 30 delinquent accounts totaling approximately $86,000. \nAbout $4,600 of the total debts are medical accounts. Applicant denied all the student \nloan accounts because he graduated in 2018 and the student loans have been on \npause since March 2020. He disputed SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.r and 1.u allegations claiming he was a \nvictim of a type of identity theft with someone converting his Social Security Number.

(June 2023 response to \nFORM) \nIn June 2013, Applicant received a high school diploma. In April 2018, he \nearned a bachelor\u2019s degree. He has never been investigated for a security clearance. \nHe has been working for a security company since April 2023. Before his current job, he \nworked as a delivery driver, a security guard, and a waiter. He was unemployed from \nAugust 2013 to January 2018 while he attended college.

His presence did not help much because she was evicted from her apartment \nwithin a short time and, while assisting his family, Applicant regrettably ignored his car \npayments, resulting in his car getting charged off. (Item 3 at 32-34) \nAll the student loan accounts listed at SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a to 1.p defaulted between \n2013 and 2017. The basis for Applicant\u2019s denials of all the student loan accounts was \nthat they were placed on a Federal Government pause in March 2020, which meant that \nhe did not have to make payments on the accounts.

Applicant \nsubmitted no documentary proof that plans exist or that he has made payments under \nany of the plans. His claim of paying an insurance company (non-SOR account) carries \nno probative weight because there is no independent evidence to support his claim. \n(June 2023 response to FORM) \nApplicant\u2019s mother has had financial difficulties over the last 13 years in raising \nApplicant\u2019s four brothers who are ages 18 to 23. After he graduated from college in May \n2018, he has provided consistent help to his mother in raising his four younger brothers. \nIt took his mother three years (2021) to find a job with satisfactory earnings. Applicant \nhas found security in his current career and is better prepared to provide for his family \neven with his wife\u2019s pregnancy problems causing her to be unemployed for a year. The \npast periods of unemployment have caused strife in Applicant\u2019s life. However, his \ncurrent job will provide him with an opportunity to improve his financial situation. (June \n2023 response to the FORM) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines and all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. These guidelines, which are flexible rules of law, are applied together with \ncommon sense and the general factors of the whole-person concept. The protection of \nthe national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(d) requires that \u201c[a]ny \ndoubt concerning personnel being considered for national security eligibility will be \nresolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . .\u201d In a \ndecision that is made on the record, it is the Applicant\u2019s responsibility to furnish \nevidence, i.e., payment receipts, bank statements, documented payment plans, to \nsupport his claims of establishing payment plans or making payments to the creditors or \ncollection agencies. The applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion in seeking a \nfavorable security clearance decision. \nAnalysis \nFinancial Considerations \nAG \u00b6 18. Failure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \n3 \n\n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nAG \u00b6 19. Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying include: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nA security clearance holder occupies a fiduciary interest with the Government \nbased on trust, reliability, and good judgment. The Government must have the trust in a \nperson to reliably comply with all security rules and regulations at all times and in all \nplaces. An excellent way to determine whether an applicant will uphold the high \nstandards of possessing a security clearance is how he addresses issues in his \npersonal life, particularly his financial matters. The record shows that Applicant has 16 \ndelinquent student loan accounts, six delinquent commercial accounts, and eight \ndelinquent medical accounts. The total monetary amount of past-due accounts is \napproximately $86,000. There has been no documented change in the amount or \nnumber of the accounts since November 9, 2021, when the SOR was published. \nApplicant was aware of at least several of the debts when he signed and certified his \nDecember 2020 e-QIP. AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and 19(c) apply. \nAG \u00b6 20. Conditions that could mitigate security concerns include: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or \nseparation, clear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity \ntheft), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n4 \n\n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control;  \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue.  \nSeveral of the accounts became delinquent in 2013 and 2014. However, other \naccounts fell delinquent in 2020 and 2021. The lack of documented action to address \nthe accounts or advise the creditors of Applicant\u2019s ongoing financial troubles, continues \nto cast doubt on his reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. It seems reasonable \nto expect an applicant to provide evidence to support his claims regarding his past-due \ndebts. See, i.e., ISCR Case No. 15-03365 at 2 (Appl Bd. Oct. 16, 2016) Applicant\u2019s \nveiled promises to pay his debts in the future does not replace a meaningful track \nrecord of payments. See ISCR Case No. 11-14570 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct. 23, 2013). AG \u00b6 \n20(a) does not apply. \nThe first prong of AG \u00b6 20(b) partially applies because of Applicant\u2019s under \nemployment as a delivery driver and a card monitor, and his unemployment while in \ncollege between 2013 and 2018, and his wife\u2019s unemployment during her recovery after \nthe birth of their daughter. However, the overall benefit to Applicant under AG \u00b6 20(b) is \nlimited due to the lack of evidence of documented action to responsibly resolve the \ndelinquent debts. AG \u00b6 20(d), requiring a good-faith effort to repay creditors, is not \navailable for mitigation either. \nAG \u00b6 20(c) is not applicable because Applicant has not received financial \ncounseling and he has presented no independent evidence to indicate that he is \nrestoring control over his delinquent debts. \nApplicant\u2019s dispute of SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.r and 1.u based on identify theft has not been \nestablished because he did not provide documentary proof of the dispute, and he \nprovided no evidence of his attempts to resolve the issue. AG \u00b6 20(e) cannot be \napplied. \nWhole-Person Concept \nI have examined the evidence under the guideline for financial considerations in \nthe context of the nine general factors of the whole-person concept listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \n5 \n\n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for \naccess to classified information must be an overall common-sense judgment based \nupon careful consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nApplicant is 28 years old and is married with a young daughter. Though he is \ncommended for trying to assist his mother and his brothers after he graduated from \ncollege in 2018, he exercised poor judgment in forsaking his own financial \nresponsibilities. His claims of setting up payment plans is not credible because of the \nlack of documentation in support. \nIn Guideline F cases, the DOHA Appeal Board has held in a long line of cases \nthat an applicant must present a \u201cmeaningful track record\u201d of debt repayments that \nresult in debt reduction. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 05-01920 at 5 (App. Bd. Mar. 1, \n2007) While an applicant is not required to show that every debt listed in the SOR is \npaid, the applicant must show that he has a plan for debt resolution and has taken \nsignificant action to implement the plan. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 02-25499 at 2 (App. \nBd. Jun. 5, 2006) From the record presented. Applicant has no plan in place and \nfurnished no evidence of even sporadic payments on the medical. His promises to pay \nthe delinquent debts are insufficient. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 14-04656 at 2 (App. Bd. \nSep. 18, 2015). Having considered the entire record from an overall commonsense \npoint of view, Applicant\u2019s ongoing financial struggles have not been mitigated. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the \nSOR, as required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 1.a-1.dd: \nAgainst Applicant \n6 \n\n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_________________ \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for access to \nclassified information. Applicant\u2019s application for a security clearance is denied. \nPaul J. Mason \nAdministrative Judge \n7 \n",

On \nDecember 1, 2021, the Department of Defense (DoD) issued a Statement of Reasons \n(SOR) to Applicant detailing security concerns under Guideline B, foreign influence. \nApplicant answered the SOR on January 19, 2022, and requested a hearing before an \nadministrative judge.

(Tr. 147-154; AE Z-CC) \nJordan \nIn AN 1, dated December 8, 2022, the Government included recent information \nfrom the U.S. Department of State about the United States\u2019 relations with Jordan and the \ncurrent conditions in that country. I take administrative notice of the following facts: \nThe U.S. Department of State overall travel advisory for Jordan is Level 2: \n\u201cExercise increased caution in Jordan due to terrorism\u201d. The threat of terrorism remains \nhigh in Jordan. Transnational and indigenous terrorist groups have demonstrated the \ncapability to plan and implement attacks in Jordan. The U.S. Department of State has \nassessed Jordan\u2019s capital city, Amman, as being a high-threat location for terrorism \ndirected at or affecting official U.S. government interests. As of the date of this decision, \nparts of Jordan are listed with Level 4 warnings: \u201cDo not travel\u201d. These areas include \nborder areas, refugee camps, Zarqa, Rusayfah and the Baqa\u2019a neighborhood of Ayn \nBasha. A Level 3 warning: \u201cReconsider travel\u201d is in effect for Ma\u2019an city, and areas of \nMa\u2019an Governorate. \nViolent extremist groups in Syria and Iraq, including the Islamic State of Iraq and \nash-Sham (ISIS) and al-Qa\u2019ida, directly or indirectly, have conducted or supported \nattacks in Jordan and continue to plot against local security forces, U.S. and Western \ninterests and \u201csoft\u201d targets such as high-profile public events, hotels, places of worship, \nrestaurants, schools, and malls. Jordan\u2019s prominent role in the Global Coalition to \nDefeat ISIS and its shared borders with Iraq and Syria increase the potential for future \nterrorist incidents. \nDue largely to its proximity to regional conflicts in Iraq and Syria, the presence \nof major terrorist organizations in both of those countries, and the Israeli-Palestinian \nconflict, the highest priorities of Jordan\u2019s military and security services in 2022 included \nsecuring its borders and the potential for domestic terrorist attacks. The terrorist group \nHezbollah and Iranian-backed militia forces were operating in southwestern Syria near \nJordan\u2019s border while fighters from the ISIS terrorist group continued operating in both \nIraq and Syria; ISIS fighters included Jordanian nationals, some of whom have returned \nto Jordan; meanwhile, individuals and groups sympathetic to Palestine have planned \nand conducted terrorist attacks in Jordan. \nRegional issues can inflame anti-U.S./anti-Western sentiment. U.S. involvement \nin Iraq and Syria as well as U.S government policies on Israel have fueled anti-U.S. \nsentiment. Certain segments of the Jordanian population view U.S. policy and military \noperations in the region unfavorably. Recent surveys of Jordanians show that more \nthan 80% of the population holds an unfavorable view of the U.S. government. \nAccording to surveys, this sentiment does not generally extend to unfavorable views of \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nU.S. citizens or U.S. culture, though U.S. citizens should always maintain a high level \nof vigilance.   \nThere have been significant human rights issues in Jordan, including credible \nreports of torture or cruel, inhuman, and degrading treatment or punishment in \ngovernment facilities, and arbitrary arrest and detention. \nIraq \nIn AN 3, dated December 8, 2022, the Government included recent information \nfrom the U.S. Department of State about the United States\u2019 relations with Iraq and the \ncurrent conditions in that country. I take administrative notice of the following facts:  \nThe U.S. Department of State travel advisory for Iraq is Level 4: \u201cDo not travel to \nIraq\u201d due to terrorism, kidnapping, armed conflict, civil unrest, and Mission Iraq\u2019s limited \ncapacity to provide support to U.S. citizens. U.S. citizens in Iraq are at high risk for \nviolence and kidnapping. Terrorist and insurgent groups regularly attack both Iraqi \nsecurity forces and civilians. Anti-U.S. sectarian militias threaten U.S. citizens and \nWestern companies throughout Iraq. Attacks using improvised explosive devices (IEDs) \noccur in many areas of the country, including Baghdad. Demonstrations, protests, and \nstrikes occur frequently. These events can develop quickly without prior notification, often \ninterrupting traffic, transportation, and other services; such events have the potential to \nturn violent. The \u201cDo not travel\u201d warning remains in effect as of the date of this decision. \nTerrorist groups and those inspired by such organizations are intent on attacking\nU.S. citizens abroad. Primary terrorist threats within Iraq included Islamic State in Iraq \nand Syria (ISIS) and Iran-aligned militia groups. ISIS is a designated terrorist \norganization, which is active in Syria and near the Iraq border. ISIS and its associated \nterrorist groups indiscriminately commit attacks and violent atrocities in Iraq despite \nimproved Iraqi government control. ISIS, militia groups, and criminal gangs target U.S. \ncitizens for attacks and hostage-taking.  \n \nThere have been significant human rights issues in Iraq, including: credible reports \nof unlawful or arbitrary killings; extrajudicial killings and forced disappearances by the \ngovernment; torture and cruel, inhumane, and degrading treatment by the government; \nand arbitrary arrest and detention. \nUAE \nIn AN 4, dated December 8, 2022, the Government included recent information \nfrom the U.S. Department of State about the United States\u2019 relations with the UAE and \nthe current conditions in that country. I take administrative notice of the following facts:  \nThe U.S. Department of State has issued a Level 3 travel advisory for the UAE, \nencouraging U.S. nationals to reconsider travel to the UAE due to the threat of missile or \ndrone attacks.

As of the date of this decision, the travel warning is Level 2: \n\u201cExercise increased caution\u201d due to the threat of missile or drone attacks and terrorism. \nThe possibility of attacks affecting U.S. citizens and interests in the Gulf and Arabian \nPeninsula remains an ongoing, serious concern \nThe UAE advanced counterterrorism efforts in 2020, particularly in the field of \ncountering terrorist financing. U.S.-UAE security agencies continue to finalize a new \ninformation sharing memorandum of cooperation to make travel safer. The UAE seeks to \nbe a leader in countering violent extremist narratives on a global level, supporting \ncountering violent extremism and participating in and hosting international fora to promote \ntolerance and coexistence. \nThe U.S. Department of State has assessed Abu Dhabi and Dubai as being \nmedium-threat locations for terrorism directed at or affecting official U.S. government \ninterests. The Department of State remains concerned about the global threat of \nterrorism, including the continuing possibility of terrorist attacks against U.S. citizens and \ninterests in the UAE given its proximity to hostile and unstable countries, importance as \na major transit hub for regional travel and commerce, strong bilateral relationship with the \nU.S., and large expatriate population. The UAE's participation in the anti-ISIS coalition \nand ongoing Yemen civil war in addition to normalizing relations with Israel has raised the \noverall likelihood of terrorist attacks against UAE and Western interests. Despite the \nrobust security apparatus, terrorist groups have threatened to target the UAE. Continued \nthreats from terrorist groups directed against U.S. interests worldwide require that U.S. \ncitizens remain alert, maintain a low profile, and incorporate good security practices into \ntheir daily activities. \nThere have been significant human rights issues in the UAE, including credible \nreports of torture in detention; arbitrary arrest and detention, including incommunicado \ndetention, by government agents; and political prisoners. \nPolicies \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG), which became \neffective on June 8, 2017. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in conjunction \nwith the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. The protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 \n2(b) requires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national \nsecurity eligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation of potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline B, Foreign Influence \nAG \u00b6 6 details the security concern about \u201cforeign contacts and interests\u201d as \nfollows: \nForeign contacts and interests, including, but not limited to, business, \nfinancial, and property interests, are a national security concern if they result \nin divided allegiance. They may also be a national security concern if they \ncreate circumstances in which the individual may be manipulated or induced \nto help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a way \ninconsistent with U.S. interests or otherwise made vulnerable to pressure or \ncoercion by any foreign interest.

The \nrisk of coercion, persuasion, or duress is significantly greater if the foreign country has an \nauthoritarian government, a family member or friend is associated with or dependent upon \nthe government, the country is known to conduct intelligence collection operations against \nthe United States, or the foreign country is associated with a risk of terrorism. \nGuideline B is not limited to countries hostile to the United States. \u201cThe United \nStates has a compelling interest in protecting and safeguarding classified information \nfrom any person, organization, or country that is not authorized to have access to it, \nregardless of whether that person, organization, or country has interests inimical to those \nof the United States.\u201d ISCR Case No. 02-11570 at 5 (App. Bd.

He and his \nwife maintain regular contact with family and friends in Jordan and the UAE, and they \ncontinue to have a close bond of affection and obligation for them. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the potentially \ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and circumstances \nsurrounding this case. I considered his character letters and character witness testimony. \nI have incorporated my comments under Guideline B in my whole-person analysis. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance. He did not provide sufficient evidence to \nmitigate the security concerns under Guideline B arising from his foreign contacts and \nconnections to Jordan and the UAE. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline B: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.b-1.j, and 1.l: \nAgainst Applicant \n11 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nSubparagraph 1.m: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIt is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant a security \nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nRoss D. Hyams \nAdministrative Judge \n12 \n",
