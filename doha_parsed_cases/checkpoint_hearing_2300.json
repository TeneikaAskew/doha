Security concerns arising under \nGuideline H (drug involvement and substance misuse) were not mitigated. Eligibility for \naccess to classified information is denied. \nStatement of the Case \nOn April 1, 2019, Applicant completed and signed a Questionnaire for National \nSecurity Positions (SF 86) or security clearance application (SCA). (Item 3). On June 18, \n2021, the Defense Counterintelligence and Security Agency, Consolidated Adjudications \nFacility (CAF) issued a statement of reasons (SOR) to Applicant under Executive Order \n(Exec. Or.) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry, February 20, \n1960; Department of Defense (DOD) Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel \nSecurity Clearance Review Program (Directive), January 2, 1992; and Security Executive \nAgent Directive 4, establishing in Appendix A the National Security Adjudicative \nGuidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information or Eligibility to \nHold a Sensitive Position (AGs), effective June 8, 2017. (Item 1) \nThe SOR detailed reasons why the CAF did not find under the Directive that it is \nclearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant or continue a security \nclearance for Applicant and recommended referral to an administrative judge to \ndetermine whether a clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked. \nSpecifically, the SOR set forth security concerns arising under Guideline H.

Additional findings follow. \nApplicant is 42 years old, and he has been employed as a senior electrical \nengineer since July 2018, and as an electrical engineer since July 2015.

In 2006 and 2012, he received certificates of completion. \n(Id. at 12-13) He has not served in the military. (Id. at 20) He is not married, and he does \nnot have any children. (Id. at 22-25) \nDrug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nSOR \u00b6 1.a alleges Applicant used marijuana with varying degrees of frequency \nfrom June 1994, to present. SOR \u00b6 1.b alleges that in 2003 he was charged with \npossession of concentrated cannabis, a felony, and later in 2003, he was convicted of a \nlesser misdemeanor-level offense and placed on three years of probation. \nIn April 2003, Applicant and his roommates were growing marijuana, and Applicant \nwas arrested for possession of concentrated cannabis. (Item 3 at 35; Item 4 at 8) He was \nfound guilty of a misdemeanor-level marijuana-related charge. He was sentenced to 75 \ndays of custody/work release, which was reduced to 45 days for good behavior. (Id.) He \npaid fines and fees totaling $4,746, and he successfully completed three years of \nprobation. (Id.) Ultimately, his conviction was dismissed and expunged. (Item 3 at 36) \nIn Applicant\u2019s SCA, he said he used marijuana from June 1994 (estimated), to \nFebruary 2019, for recreational purposes on a daily basis for several months \n\u201cinterspersed with years of abstinence.\u201d (Item 3 at 37) He did not use marijuana while \nholding a security clearance or a sensitive position. (Id.) He said, \u201cI do not want to \njeopardize my career or national security. If this substance becomes permissible to use \nwhile employed with a secret clearance at some point, I may consider using it again.\u201d (Id. \nat 38).                                       \nOn May 15, 2019, Applicant told an investigator from the Office of Personnel \nManagement (OPM) that he used marijuana recreationally with friends, and occasionally \nby himself, and his most recent marijuana use was in February 2019.

The FORM informed Applicant that he had \n30 days from the receipt of the FORM \u201cin which to submit a documentary response \nsetting forth objections, rebuttal, extenuation, mitigation, or explanation, as \nappropriate. . . . If Applicant does not file any objections or submit any additional \ninformation . . . [his] case will be assigned to an Administrative Judge for a determination \nbased solely\u201d on the evidence set forth in this FORM. (FORM at 3 (emphasis added)) \nApplicant did not provide any response to the FORM. \nPolicies \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the Executive \nBranch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security emphasizing, \n\u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. \n518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to control \naccess to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual \nis sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The President \nhas authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicant\u2019s eligibility for \naccess to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \nIndustry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nabout potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Clearance \ndecisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a \ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 7. \nThus, nothing in this decision should be construed to suggest that it is based, in whole or \nin part, on any express or implied determination about applicant\u2019s allegiance, loyalty, or \npatriotism. It is merely an indication the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the \n3 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \nPresident, Secretary of Defense, and Director of National Intelligence have established \nfor issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 at 2 \n(App. Bd. May 2, 1996). \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it \nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d \nISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). The burden of disproving a \nmitigating condition never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 \n(App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if they must, \non the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b).  \nAnalysis \nDrug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nAG \u00b6 24 provides the security concern arising from drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse stating: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior may \nlead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises questions \nabout a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, and \nregulations. Controlled substance means any \"controlled substance\" as \ndefined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term adopted in \nthis guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above. \nAG \u00b6 25 provides two conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying in this case: \u201c(a) any substance misuse (see above definition)\u201d; and \u201c(c) \nillegal possession of a controlled substance. . . .\u201d The record establishes AG \u00b6\u00b6 25(a) and \n25(c). Additional information is contained in the mitigation section, infra. \n4 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \nAG \u00b6 26 lists four conditions that could mitigate security concerns: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and substance \nmisuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and \nhas established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not limited to: \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; and \n \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that any future \ninvolvement or misuse is grounds for revocation of national security \neligibility; \n(c) abuse of prescription drugs was after a severe or prolonged illness \nduring which these drugs were prescribed, and abuse has since ended; and \n(d) satisfactory completion of a prescribed drug treatment program, \nincluding, but not limited to, rehabilitation and aftercare requirements, \nwithout recurrence of abuse, and a favorable prognosis by a duly qualified \nmedical professional. \nIn ISCR Case No. 10-04641 at 4 (App. Bd. Sept. 24, 2013), the DOHA Appeal \nBoard concisely explained Applicant\u2019s responsibility for proving the applicability of \nmitigating conditions as follows: \nOnce a concern arises regarding an Applicant\u2019s security clearance \neligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance of \na security clearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th \nCir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991). After the Government \npresents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the \napplicant to rebut or mitigate those concerns. See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. The \nstandard applicable in security clearance decisions is that articulated in \nEgan, supra. \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access \nto classified information will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nDirective, Enclosure 2, [App. A] \u00b6 2(b).   \nNone of the mitigating conditions fully apply; however, Applicant provided some \nimportant mitigating information. He voluntarily disclosed his marijuana possession and \nuse on his SCA, during his OPM interview, in response to DOHA interrogatories, and in \nhis SOR response. \n5 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe evidence against mitigation is more persuasive at this time. In ISCR Case No. \n16-03460 at 4 (App. Bd. May 24, 2018), the applicant had a history of marijuana use, and \nthe Appeal Board said: \nA clearance adjudication is aimed at determining if an applicant has the \nrequisite judgment and reliability to abide by rules designed to protect \nclassified information. . . . [Security concerns arise if] there is doubt as to \nwhether he [or she] will follow the regulatory requirements for handling \nclassified information, which might, in the event, appear burdensome. \nAccess to national secrets entails a fiduciary duty to the U.S. A person who \nenters into such a fiduciary relationship is charged with abiding by legal and \nregulatory guidance regardless of whether he or she believes that guidance \nto be wise. \n \nPossession of a Schedule I controlled substance is a federal criminal offense. \nSchedules I, II, III, IV, and V, as referred to in the Controlled Substances Act are contained \nin 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 812(c). Marijuana is a Schedule I controlled substance. See Drug \nEnforcement \nAdministration \nlisting \nat \nhttp://www.deadiversion.usdoj.gov/ \n21cfr/cfr/1308/1308 11.htm. See also Gonzales v. Raish, 545 U.S. 1 (2005) (discussing \nplacement of marijuana on Schedule I). \nIn 2003, Applicant and his roommates were growing marijuana. He was charged \nwith possession of concentrated cannabis, a felony, and later in 2003, he was convicted \nof a lesser misdemeanor-level marijuana-related offense and placed on three years of \nprobation. In his SCA, Applicant said he used marijuana with varying degrees of \nfrequency from 1994 to February 2019. In April 2020, Applicant responded to a DOHA \nquestion about his marijuana use since February 2019, and he said that he used \nmarijuana \u201c[s]everal times per year usually with holidays.\u201d (Item 4 at 4) He did not \nspecifically indicate his most recent marijuana use. He did not describe any drug-abuse \ncounseling or treatment in the previous five years. \nApplicant\u2019s most recent marijuana possession and use occurred after he was \naware of federal rules against marijuana use, and after he completed his SCA. \u201cAn \napplicant who uses marijuana after having been placed on notice of its security \nsignificance, such as using after having completed a clearance application, may be \nlacking in the qualities expected of those with access to national secrets.\u201d ISCR Case No. \n17-03191 at 3 (App. Bd. Mar. 26, 2019) (citing ISCR Case No. 17-04198 at 2 (App. Bd. \nJan. 15, 2019) (\u201cAn applicant\u2019s misuse of drugs after having been placed on notice of the \nincompatibility of drug abuse with clearance eligibility raises questions about his or her \njudgment and reliability)). Applicant has friends who use marijuana, and it is likely that he \nwill be in the vicinity of marijuana in the future. It is unclear when Applicant most recently \nused marijuana.

The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), \u201c[t]he ultimate determination\u201d of whether to grant a security \nclearance \u201cmust be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines\u201d and the whole-person concept. My comments under Guideline H are \nincorporated in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were \naddressed under that guideline but some warrant additional comment. \nApplicant is 42 years old, and he has been employed as a senior electrical \nengineer since July 2018, and as an electrical engineer since July 2015. He was awarded \na bachelor\u2019s degree in 2002. In 2006 and 2012, he received certificates of completion. \nApplicant disclosed his marijuana possession and use on his SCA, during his OPM \ninterview, in his responses to DOHA interrogatories, and on his SOR response. An honest \nand candid self-report of drug abuse is an important indication that, if granted security \nclearance eligibility, the individual would disclose any threats to national security, even if \nthe disclosure involves an issue that might damage his or her own career or personal \nreputation. However, the mitigating weight of Applicant\u2019s disclosures is undermined by \nhis marijuana possession and use beginning in 1994 and continuing after he completed \nhis SCA in February 2019. \nIt is well settled that once a concern arises regarding an applicant\u2019s security \nclearance eligibility, there is a strong presumption against granting a security clearance. \nSee Dorfmont, 913 F. 2d at 1401. \u201c[A] favorable clearance decision means that the record \ndiscloses no basis for doubt about an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified \ninformation.\u201d ISCR Case No. 18-02085 at 7 (App. Bd.

The SOR recommended referral to an administrative judge to \ndetermine whether a clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked. \nIn a sworn statement, dated June 23, 2021, Applicant responded to the SOR and \nelected to have his case decided on the written record in lieu of a hearing. A complete \ncopy of the Government\u2019s file of relevant material (FORM) was mailed to Applicant by \nDOHA on July 23, 2021, and he was afforded an opportunity, within a period of 30 days, \nto file objections and submit material in refutation, extenuation, or mitigation. In addition \nto the FORM, Applicant was furnished a copy of the Directive as well as the Adjudicative \nGuidelines applicable to his case. Applicant received the FORM on July 28, 2021. His \nresponse was due on August 27, 2021. He timely responded and submitted a one-page \nstatement \u2013 essentially a manifesto regarding marijuana \u2013 to which there was no \nobjection. The document was marked and admitted into evidence as Applicant Exhibit \n(AE) A. The case was assigned to me on October 6, 2021. The record closed on August \n27, 2021. \nFindings of Fact \nIn his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted, without commentary, the factual \nallegations pertaining to drug involvement and substance misuse (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a. through \n1.c.). Applicant\u2019s admissions are incorporated herein as findings of fact. After a complete \nand thorough review of the evidence in the record, and upon due consideration of same, \nI make the following additional findings of fact: \nBackground \nApplicant is a 33-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has been with his \nemployer since July 2020, and currently serves as a test technician. He attended courses \nat two different colleges, including one from which he anticipates receiving a certificate, \notherwise not described, but he has not received a degree. He has never served with the \nU.S. military. He has never been married. He has no children. He has never been granted \na security clearance. \nDrug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nApplicant was a recreational substance abuser whose substance of choice was \nmarijuana \u2013 a Schedule I Controlled Substance. He is aware that marijuana use is illegal \nfederally, but it is legal in the state where he used it. Marijuana makes him feel relaxed, \nlazier, and makes him \u201cbuzzed\u201d for about three hours. He denied that it impaired him or \nthat it was outwardly noticeable. The frequency of his marijuana use varied. He started \nusing marijuana in September 2008, initially weekly or monthly, but by 2011, it increased \nto daily. Between 2011 and 2021, the frequency was inconsistent, going between daily \nuse, weekly use, and monthly use, as well as no use for short periods. He used marijuana \nbefore work, during lunch breaks, or after work, in a variety of locations, including houses, \n2 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \nparks, or cars. He frequently smoked marijuana with friends, but sometimes did it by \nhimself at home. He last used marijuana on New Year\u2019s Day 2021, two months after \ncompleting his SF 86. (Item 3, at 29; Item 4, at 6-9) \nApplicant purchased marijuana on numerous occasions between October 2008 \nand November 2020. He generally purchased small amounts of marijuana every week or \ntwo from different dealers whose identities he could not (or would not) recall. In October \n2016, he obtained a medical recommendation to acquire marijuana from state-run \ndispensaries, supposedly to treat his insomnia. (Item 3, at 30; Item 4, at 7-9) \nAs noted above, in his Response to the FORM, Applicant submitted a manifesto \nregarding marijuana: \n. . . It is my firm belief that the federal laws regarding marijuana are under \nthe best interpretation a foolish waste of taxpayer money. In the worst case \nthey are a serious moral injustice visited upon the American people by their \nown government. Based on their public statements and sponsored \nlegislation Charles Schumer and Jerry Nadler appear to agree with these \ninterpretations. Millions have been incarcerated and millions more have \nbeen impacted by negative externalities of a drug that far exceed its \ninherent harm potential. There is a distinct possibility that when these \nproceedings are concluded, I will be one of them. I am convinced that it is \nonly the exceedingly slow and detached nature of national level politics that \nhas kept these laws on the books for so long. The evidence for this is clear: \nstate governments, both faster moving and more reactive to the population, \nhave begun legalizing marijuana at an accelerating pace, and national \nopinion polls show widespread and bipartisan support for national level \nlegislation. Clearly by its nature, congress can only catch up. . . eventually. \n. . . The speculation of the opposing counsel is true: I did not know that an \nintention to continue using marijuana would be immediately disqualifying \nuntil I received a copy of the adjudicative guidelines alongside the statement \nof reasons. The further assumption they have made whereby I would have \ninferred this based on being questioned about usage is incorrect. I was \nquestioned about several of my responses, and it seemed reasonable to be \nasked for clarification on these topics. \nI now understand that it was foolish to believe that bureaucratic realities \nwould reflect social or political realities rather than legal ones, or that every \nbranch of the federal government would have the same attitude towards \nthese laws. I recognize that despite my or anyone else\u2019s opinions of these \nlaws, my compliance with them is necessary for these proceedings to come \nto a positive conclusion. Based on this, and as my intended continued use \nof marijuana was to be infrequent anyway, I am willing to come to the \nfollowing agreement: I will henceforth abstain from any and all purchases or \nuse of federally illegal marijuana or cannabis products until such time as \nthose products are decriminalized or legalized at the federal level. \n3 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n     \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nI realize that any final decision you make must be guided, specifically, by \nthe adjudicative guidelines laid down in 1992 and updated in 1999. I only \nask that you take into account the sweeping changes that have taken place \nacross this nation since that time when considering the impact my previous \nnon-compliance should have. Further, I wish to remind you that the answers \ngiven in the e-QIP form and subject interview were given truthfully, and in \ngood faith, and that the agreement offered in the preceding paragraph is in \nthis same spirit. \n(AE A) \nApplicant continues to socialize with at least two friends who are still using \nmarijuana. Until his response to the FORM, dated August 23, 2021 \u2013 approximately 9 \nweeks ago, and after 13 years of using marijuana \u2013 he planned to continue using \nmarijuana in the future, but not as frequently as before. Only now has his declared intent \nchanged, conditionally, until the use of marijuana is legalized at the federal level. As he \nnoted, his use of marijuana was initially candidly reported by him in his SF 86. (Item 3, at \n29-30) He was also candid when he was interviewed by an investigator from the U.S. \nOffice of Personnel Management (OPM). He has never received counseling or treatment \nas a result of his use of marijuana. (Item, 4, at 8) \nPolicies \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the Executive \nBranch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security emphasizing, \n\u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d (Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. \n518, 528 (1988)) As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to control \naccess to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual \nis sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information. The President has \nauthorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant an applicant eligibility for \naccess to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to do so.\u201d (Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \nIndustry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified.) \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the guidelines in SEAD 4. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the guidelines list potentially disqualifying \nconditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility \nfor access to classified information. \nAn administrative judge need not view the guidelines as inflexible, ironclad rules \nof law. Instead, acknowledging the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. The entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known \nas the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \n4 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n       \n \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a meaningful decision. \nIn the decision-making process, facts must be established by \u201csubstantial \nevidence.\u201d \u201cSubstantial evidence [is] such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might \naccept as adequate to support a conclusion in light of all contrary evidence in the record.\u201d \n(ISCR Case No. 04-11463 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2006) (citing Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1)). \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d  (See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th  Cir. 1994).) \nThe Government initially has the burden of producing evidence to establish a \npotentially disqualifying condition under the Directive, and has the burden of establishing \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Once the Government has produced substantial \nevidence of a disqualifying condition, under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant has the \nburden of persuasion to present evidence in refutation, explanation, extenuation or \nmitigation, sufficient to overcome the doubts raised by the Government\u2019s case. The \nburden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government. (See ISCR \nCase No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).) \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours as well. It is \nbecause of this special relationship that the Government must be able to repose a high \ndegree of trust and confidence in those individuals to whom it grants access to classified \ninformation. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the \napplicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. Such \ndecisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather \nthan actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Furthermore, \u201csecurity clearance \ndeterminations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d (Egan, 484 U.S. at 531) \nClearance decisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense \nbe a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d (See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 \n7) Thus, nothing in this decision should be construed to suggest that I have based this \ndecision, in whole or in part, on any express or implied determination as to Applicant\u2019s \nallegiance, loyalty, or patriotism. It is merely an indication the Applicant has or has not \nmet the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for \nissuing a clearance.  In reaching this decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that \nare reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I \nhave avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \nAnalysis \nGuideline H, Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Drug Involvement and Substance \nAbuse is set out in AG \u00b6 24: \n5 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual's reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior may \nlead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. Controlled substance means any \"controlled substance\" as \ndefined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term adopted in \nthis guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above. \nFurthermore, on October 25, 2014, the Director of National Intelligence (DNI) \nissued Memorandum ES 2014-00674, Adherence to Federal Laws Prohibiting Marijuana \nUse, which states: \n[C]hanges to state laws and the laws of the District of Columbia pertaining \nto marijuana use do not alter the existing National Security Adjudicative \nGuidelines (Reference H and I). An individual's disregard of federal law \npertaining to the use, sale, or manufacture of marijuana remains \nadjudicatively relevant in national security determinations. As always, \nadjudicative authorities are expected to evaluate claimed or developed use \nof, or involvement with, marijuana using the current adjudicative criteria. \nThe adjudicative authority must determine if the use of, or involvement with, \nmarijuana raises questions about the individual's judgment, reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and willingness to comply with law, rules, and regulations, \nincluding federal laws, when making eligibility decisions of persons \nproposed for, or occupying, sensitive national security positions. \nThe guideline notes some conditions under AG \u00b6 25 that could raise security \nconcerns in this case: \n(a) any substance misuse (see above definition);  \n(c) illegal possession of a controlled substance, including. . .purchase. . .; \nand  \n(g) expressed intent to continue drug involvement and substance misuse, \nor failure to clearly and convincingly commit to discontinue such misuse. \nApplicant was admittedly a recreational substance abuser from September 2008 \nuntil January 2021 whose substance of choice was marijuana \u2013 a Schedule I Controlled \nSubstance. He was aware that marijuana use is illegal federally, but it is legal in the state \nwhere he used it. He last used marijuana on New Year\u2019s Day 2021. He also purchased \nmarijuana on numerous occasions between October 2008 and November 2020. He \ninitially expressed an intent to continue using marijuana in the future, but not as frequently \nas before. It was not until approximately 9 weeks ago, and after 13 years of using \nmarijuana, that his declared intent changed, conditionally. He now claims he will abstain \n6 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nfrom further marijuana use until such use is legalized at the federal level. AG \u00b6\u00b6 25 (a), \n25 (b), and 25 (g) have been established. \nOne issue deserves additional comment. The SOR addresses, in SOR \u00b6 1.a., \nApplicant\u2019s continued purchase and use of marijuana from October 2008 to at least \nJanuary 2021. It also alleges as a separate allegation in SOR \u00b6 1.c., his use of marijuana \nthat continued after he executed his SF 86 in October 2020 \u2013 a period already covered in \nSOR \u00b6 1.a. This raises several separate concerns regarding the rules of pleading: \nduplicity, multiplicity, and the unreasonable multiplication of allegations \u2013 all of which are \nlegally frowned upon. \nDuplicity is the joining in a single count of two or more distinct and separate \noffenses \u2013 in this instance, purchasing and using marijuana. It is specifically raised here \nbecause the SOR alleges Applicant purchased and used marijuana from about October \n2008 to at least January 2021. The evidence does not support the purchase segment of \nthe allegation, for the specific date Applicant said he last purchased marijuana was in \nNovember 2020. (Item 4, at 7) On January 13, 2021, he confirmed that there had been \nno updates or changes regarding his use of marijuana, and the issue of the purchase of \nmarijuana was not raised. (Item 4, at 9) \nMultiplicity is the charging of a single offense in several counts \u2013 in this instance, \nnot only repeating the reference to SOR \u00b6 1.a. in SOR \u00b6 1.c., but also alleging that the \nconduct continued after October 27, 2020 \u2013 a date included in the conduct alleged in SOR \n\u00b6 1.a. Using marijuana after executing the SF 86 is not a separate offense under the AG, \nand the SOR merely resorted to unreasonable and unnecessary multiplication of charges. \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions under AG \u00b6 26 that could \nmitigate security concerns arising from Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened\nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt\non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; and\n \n \n \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and substance \nmisuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and \nhas established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not limited to: (1) \ndisassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; (2) changing or \navoiding the environment where drugs were used; and (3) providing a \nsigned statement of intent to abstain from all drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, acknowledging that any future involvement or misuse is \ngrounds for revocation of national security eligibility. \nNeither condition applies. Applicant regularly used marijuana for 13 years until at \nleast New Year\u2019s Day 2021. There is no evidence of Applicant ever having received \ntreatment and counseling as a result of his illegal use of a controlled substance.

He \nwas candid about his use of marijuana when he completed his SF 86 and spoke with the \nOPM investigator, and for that candor, he is given credit. He acknowledged his drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse, but he offered no evidence of actions taken to \novercome those issues, such as exploring drug treatment and therapy; changing or \navoiding the environment where marijuana was used; or disassociating from his drug-\nusing friends. He failed to provide a signed statement of intent, acknowledging that any \nfuture involvement or misuse is grounds for revocation of national security eligibility \nA person should not be held forever accountable for misconduct from the past. \nContinued abstinence is to be encouraged, but, when balanced against his full history of \napproximately 13 years of marijuana use, the relatively brief period of approximately ten \nmonths of reported abstinence is considered insufficient to conclude that the abstinence \nwill continue. Applicant\u2019s claimed new compliance with laws, rules, and regulations, is in \nstark contrast to his cavalier attitude towards those same laws, rules, and regulations. His \nuse of marijuana despite knowing that such use was prohibited by the Government, and \nhis refusal, until several weeks ago, to disavow future marijuana use, continue to cast \ndoubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. Moreover, I have \nevaluated the various aspects of this case in light of the totality of the record evidence \nand have not merely performed a piecemeal analysis. (See U.S. v. Bottone, 365 F.2d \n389, 392 (2d Cir. 1966); See also ISCR Case No. 03-22861 at 2-3 (App. Bd. Jun. 2, 2006)) \nThere is some evidence mitigating Applicant\u2019s conduct. He is a 33-year-old \nemployee of a defense contractor. He has been with his employer since July 2020, and \ncurrently serves as a test technician. He has attended college and anticipates receiving \na certificate, otherwise not described.

Approximately nine weeks ago, he stated that he will abstain from further \nmarijuana use until such use is legalized at the federal level. \nThe disqualifying evidence under the whole-person concept is more substantial. \nApplicant was admittedly a recreational substance abuser from September 2008 until \nJanuary 2021 whose substance of choice was marijuana \u2013 a Schedule I Controlled \nSubstance. He was aware that marijuana use is illegal federally, but it is legal in the state \nwhere he used it. He last used marijuana on New Year\u2019s Day 2021. He also purchased \nmarijuana on numerous occasions between October 2008 and November 2020. He \ninitially expressed an intent to continue using marijuana in the future, but not as frequently \nas before. It was not until approximately 9 weeks ago, and after 13 years of using \nmarijuana, that his declared intent changed, conditionally. He has never received \ntreatment and counseling as a result of his illegal use of a controlled substance. \nOverall, the evidence leaves me with substantial questions and doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all of these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant has failed to mitigate the security concerns arising from his drug \ninvolvement and substance abuse. See SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6\u00b6 2(d) (1) through AG 2(d) (9). \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline H: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a. \u2013 1.b.: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.c.: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

Items 2 through 7 and AE A are admitted into evidence without objection. The \ncase was assigned to me on December 14, 2021. \nFindings of Fact \nIn Applicant\u2019s SOR response, he denied SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b, 1.d, 1.g, and 1.l. He \nadmitted SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c, 1.e, 1.f, 1.h through 1.k, 1.m, and 1.n. Applicant\u2019s admissions are \naccepted as findings of fact. The credit reports in evidence support the delinquent debts \nalleged in the SOR. (Items 1, 5 and 6) \nApplicant is 62 years old. He married in 1997 and divorced in 2013. Since February \n2020, Applicant has been employed by a defense contractor. His job title is configuration \nmanager. (Item 2) \nThe SOR alleges under Guideline F that Applicant has 14 delinquent debts totaling \nabout $81,000. He also had approximately $35,000 in past due mortgage payments. \nApplicant disclosed adverse financial information on the SCA he signed in February 2020. \nHe stated in his November 2021 response to the Government\u2019s brief that from 2011 \nthrough 2013 he was going through a divorce. He was paying for a house and the utilities \nfor his wife, and also paying for an apartment and utilities for himself. These \ncircumstances caused him to experience financial issues, and he had to use his personal \nsavings and retirement savings to stay current with his financial obligations. (Item 1; AE \nA) \nIn 2016, Applicant was admitted to the hospital for a couple of months due to \nkidney complications. After his employer\u2019s paid leave was used up, he no longer received \na paycheck. Applicant was placed on short-term disability and was paid about 75% of his \noriginal paycheck, but then he was required to go on long-term disability, where he only \nreceived about 50% of his paycheck. He tried to get approval from his doctor to return to \nwork, but he soon discovered that he had congestive heart failure, and he was required \nto stay on long-term disability. In 2017 and 2018, he continued to fall behind on his bills, \nand with the addition of his medical bills, he found himself in a precarious financial \nsituation. He became delinquent on his mortgage in 2018, and in 2019, his vehicle was \nrepossessed and he was evicted from his apartment. His home eventually went into \nforeclosure.

According to AG \u00b6 2(a), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision.

Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. . . . \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an individual might knowingly \ncompromise classified information in order to raise money. It encompasses concerns \nabout an individual\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting \nclassified information. An individual who is financially irresponsible may also be \nirresponsible, unconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified \ninformation. ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nThe SOR debts are established by the credit reports and Applicant\u2019s admissions \nin the record. AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and 19(c) apply. \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising \nfrom financial difficulties. The following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially \napplicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nunexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; and \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nIn May 2020, Applicant was placed on notice during his background interview that \nhis outstanding debts were a security concern to the Government. In his July 2021 SOR \nresponse, he said that his investments and annuities would provide enough money to pay \noff all of his debts. The evidence in the record is clear that Applicant\u2019s financial issues \nwere due to circumstances beyond his control. However, the second prong of this \nassessment, whether Applicant acted responsibly under the circumstances to resolve his \nfinancial delinquencies after being put on notice, must also be established. Although he \nprovided a timeline with detailed explanations, Applicant provided no proof of account \nsettlements or payments for any of the alleged SOR debts in his response to the \nGovernment\u2019s brief. He did not submit documentation of any past communications with \ncreditors, or provide the current status of these delinquent accounts. The record is lacking \nevidence of his good-faith effort to repay or resolve any of his past due debts. The second \nprong of this assessment has not been satisfied. There is insufficient evidence to show \nthat Applicant\u2019s financial problems are under control and unlikely to recur. None of the \nmitigating conditions apply. Applicant failed to mitigate the financial considerations \nsecurity concerns. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a public trust position by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of \nthe guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the potentially disqualifying \nand mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and circumstances surrounding this case. \nI have incorporated my comments under Guideline F and the AG \u00b6 2(d) factors in this \nwhole-person analysis. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                     \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \n \n  \n \n \n \n \nApplicant is 62 years old and has been employed by a federal contractor since \nFebruary 2020. He did not provide any evidence of payments, payment plans, or other \nactions to resolve the debts alleged in the SOR. There is no track record of steady, \nsystematic payments over an extended period of time. His actions show a lack of financial \nresponsibility and raise questions about his trustworthiness, reliability, and ability to \nprotect classified information. I have carefully applied the law, as set forth in Egan, Exec. \nOr. 10865, the Directive, and the AGs, to the facts and circumstances in the context of \nthe whole person. I conclude that financial consideration concerns are not mitigated. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \nAGAINST A\n PPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a.-1.n:  \nAgainst Applicant  \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented, it is not clearly consistent with the \ninterests of national security to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to \nclassified information. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nPamela C. Benson \nAdministrative Judge \n6 \n",

In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines (AG) list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law.

The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. The entire \nprocess is a conscientious scrutiny of applicable guidelines in the context of a number \nof variables known as the whole-person concept. The administrative judge must \nconsider all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable \nand unfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. I have not drawn inferences based on mere \nspeculation or conjecture. \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.14, requires the Government to present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d \n \nA person applying for national security eligibility seeks to enter into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants national security eligibility. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified or \nsensitive information. Finally, as emphasized in Section 7 of Executive Order 10865, \n\u201c[a]ny determination under this order adverse to an applicant shall be a determination in \nterms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty \nof the applicant concerned.\u201d See also Executive Order 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing \nmultiple prerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information.) \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \nAnalysis \nGuideline G: Alcohol Consumption \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Alcohol Consumption is set out \nin AG \u00b6 21: \nExcessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable \njudgment or the failure to control impulses, and can raise questions about \nan individual's reliability and trustworthiness. \nThe guideline at AG \u00b6 22 contains seven conditions that could raise a security \nconcern and may be disqualifying. Five conditions may apply: \n(a) alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while under \nthe influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or \nother incidents of concern, regardless of the frequency of the individual's \nalcohol use or whether the individual has been diagnosed with alcohol use \ndisorder; \n(c) habitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point of impaired \njudgment, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed with alcohol \nuse disorder;  \n(d) diagnosis by a duly qualified medical or mental health professional \n(e.g., physician, clinical psychologist, psychiatrist, or licensed clinical \nsocial worker) of alcohol use disorder; \n(e) the failure to follow treatment advice once diagnosed; and \n(f) alcohol consumption, which is not in accordance with treatment \nrecommendations, after a diagnosis of alcohol use disorder. \nApplicant has five alcohol-related work incidents between 2013 and 2019. She \nhas also been diagnosed as suffering from a severe Alcohol Use Disorder. These facts \nestablish prima facie support for the foregoing disqualifying conditions, and shift the \nburden to Applicant to mitigate those concerns. \nThe guideline at AG \u00b6 23 contains four conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns. Three conditions may apply: \n(a) so much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, \nor judgment; \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                 \n \n                               \n                                                                                                                                          \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n          \n \n \n \n \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her pattern of maladaptive alcohol \nuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and \nhas demonstrated a clear and established pattern of modified \nconsumption \nor \nabstinence \nin \naccordance \nwith \ntreatment \nrecommendations; and \n(d) the individual has successfully completed a treatment program along \nwith any required aftercare, and has demonstrated a clear and established \npattern of modified consumption or abstinence in accordance with \ntreatment recommendations. \nNone of these apply. Applicant, still consumes alcohol, despite being diagnosed \nwith a severe Alcohol Use Disorder. \nGuideline I \u2013 Psychological Conditions  \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Psychological Conditions is set \nforth at AG \u00b6 27: \nCertain emotional, mental, and personality conditions can impair \njudgment, reliability, or trustworthiness. A formal diagnosis of a disorder is \nnot required for there to be a concern under this guideline. A duly qualified \nmental health professional (e.g. clinical psychologist or psychiatrist) \nemployed by, or acceptable to and approved by the U.S. Government, \nshould be consulted when evaluating potentially disqualifying and \nmitigating information under this guideline and an opinion, including \nprognosis, should be sought. No negative inference concerning the \nstandards in this guideline may be raised solely on the basis of mental \nhealth counseling. \nThe guideline at AG \u00b6 28 contains five conditions that could raise a security \nconcern and may be disqualifying. Three conditions are established: \n(a) behavior that casts doubt on an individual\u2019s judgment, stability,\nreliability, or trustworthiness, not covered under any other guideline and\nthat may indicate an emotional, mental or personality condition, including,\nbut not limited to, irresponsible, violent, self-harm, suicidal, paranoid,\nmanipulative, impulsive, chronic lying, deceitful, exploitative, or bizarre\nbehaviors;                                                                                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n(b) opinion by a duly qualified mental health professional that the \nindividual has a condition that may impair judgment, stability, reliability, or \ntrustworthiness; and                                                                                        \n(d) failure to follow a prescribed treatment plan related to a diagnosed \npsychological/psychiatric condition that may impair judgment, stability, \n5 \n\n \n \n \n                           \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s national security eligibility by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nreliability, or trustworthiness, including but not limited to failure to take \nprescribed medication or failure to attend required counseling sessions.           \nAppellant is suffering from Alcohol Use Disorder; i.e., her alcoholism is affecting \nApplicant psychologically. Therefore, AG \u00b6 28 is established. \nThe guideline at AG \u00b6 29 contains five conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns: \n(a) the identified condition is readily controlled with treatment, and the \nindividual has demonstrated ongoing and consistent compliance with the \ntreatment plan; \n(b) the individual has voluntarily entered a counseling or program for a \ncondition that is amenable to treatment, and the individual is currently \nreceiving counseling or treatment with a favorable prognosis by a duly \nqualified metal health professional; \n(c) recent opinion by a duly qualified mental health professional employed \nby, or acceptable to and approved by, or acceptable to and approved by \nthe U.S. Government that an individual\u2019s previous condition is under \ncontrol or in remission, and has a low probability of recurrence or \nexacerbation; \n(d) the past psychological/psychiatric condition was temporary, the\nsituation has been resolved, and the individual no longer shows\nindications of emotional instability; and \n \n \n(e) there is no indication of a current problem. \nNone of these apply. Despite her \u201csevere\u201d Alcohol Use Disorder diagnosis, \nApplicant still consumes alcohol. \nWhole-Person Concept \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \nAccording to AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant national \nsecurity eligibility must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the applicable guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuidelines G and H in my whole-person analysis. Overall, the record evidence leaves \nme with questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security \nclearance. For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant failed to mitigate the Alcohol \nConsumption and Psychological Conditions security concerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline G:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a~1.h: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline I: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 2.a: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nRichard A. Cefola \nAdministrative Judge \n7 \n",

In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(a), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk that an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAnalysis \nGuideline H, Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nAG \u00b6 24 expresses the security concern pertaining to drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual's reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior \nmay lead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. Controlled substance means any \"controlled substance\" \nas defined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term \nadopted in this guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above. \nAG \u00b6 25 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. Two conditions are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) any substance misuse; and   \n(f) any illegal drug use while granted access to classified information or \nholding a sensitive position \nApplicant used marijuana on one occasion in August 2020, while having access \nto classified information. I find that both of the above disqualifying conditions apply. \nAG \u00b6 26 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. Two \npotentially apply in this case: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \nand \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this \nproblem, and has established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not \nlimited to: \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; \nand \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that any future \ninvolvement or misuse is grounds for revocation of national security \neligibility. \nWhile Applicant\u2019s use of marijuana was not frequent, once 30 years ago and \nonce in August 2020, it was recent. It is troubling that Applicant admitted his first use 30 \nyears ago to an investigator, but made no mention of it in his more recent answer to the \nSOR. Also troubling is his claimed ignorance of his company\u2019s drug policy for whom he \nhas worked for over 30 years, while holding a security clearance for at least 18 years. \nHe also failed to provide a signed statement of his intent not to use marijuana in the \nfuture. Applicant\u2019s short abstention is insufficient to convince me that recurrence is \nunlikely. Additionally, his use of marijuana while holding a security clearance casts \ndoubt upon his current reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. AG \u00b6\u00b6 26(a) and \n26(b) do not apply. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guideline and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I considered that he used marijuana \nin August 2020, at the age of 54, having worked for a defense contractor for over 30 \nyears, and having access to classified information for 18 years. I also considered the \ncircumstances he described surrounding his use in August 2020 and his stated intent \nnot to use marijuana in the future. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nconclude Applicant failed to mitigate the security concerns arising under Guideline H, \ndrug involvement and substance misuse.  \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline H:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph    1.a: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security \nclearance.

Applicant\u2019s admissions and comments are incorporated herein. \nAfter a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, and upon due \nconsideration of same, I make the following findings of fact: \nBackground \nApplicant is a 65-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has been serving\nas a project manager with his current employer since August 2014. He was previously \nemployed by other employers in similar positions (March 2011 \u2013 May 2013; and June \n2013 \u2013 August 2014), and as a security officer (August 2003 \u2013 April 2006; May 2006 \u2013 \nAugust 2007; August 2007 \u2013 February 2008; February 2008 \u2013 April 2009; and May 2009 \n\u2013 March 2011). He is a 1974 high school graduate. He has never served with the U.S. \nmilitary. He was apparently granted a top secret clearance in 2020. He was married in \n1977. He has one child, born in 1980.  \n \nFinancial Considerations \nGeneral source information pertaining to the financial accounts discussed below \ncan be found in the following exhibits: Item 3 (Enhanced Subject Interview, dated October \n20, 2020); Item 4 (Combined Experian, TransUnion, and Equifax Credit Report, dated \nSeptember 2, 2020); Item 5 (Equifax Credit Report, dated June 21, 2021); and Item 2 \n(Answer to the SOR, dated September 20, 2021). \nOn November 7, 2017, Applicant and his wife voluntarily filed a petition for \nbankruptcy under Chapter 13 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. They listed $280,630 worth \nof assets and $389,737 in liabilities. (Item 7) A bankruptcy plan was confirmed in May \n2018, and certain claims were allowed. The bankruptcy trustee paid $31,648.64 (of the \nallowed $223,331.15) for the ongoing mortgage, and $813,31 (of the allowed $6,164.20) \n2 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nfor other secured claims, totaling $32,461.95 in principal paid, and $400.68 in interest \npaid. Including $6,542.85 expenses for administration, the total disbursements were \n$39,405.48. However, because Applicant failed to fulfill his obligations, the bankruptcy \ntrustee filed an action to remedy default by Applicant, and the case was eventually \ndismissed on August 1, 2019. (Item 8)  \nIn his SF 86, Applicant denied having any delinquency issues involving routine \naccounts in the last seven years (referring to 2013 \u2013 2020), but he did acknowledge that \nhe had filed for bankruptcy, and that the bankruptcy had been discharged in 2019 before \nit was completed. He stated that he would be \u201csettling with creditors as needed.\u201d (Item 2, \nat 37-39) A review of his credit reports from 2020 \u2013 2021 indicates that there are \nnumerous delinquent accounts. \nApplicant was interviewed by an investigator from the U.S. Office of Personnel \nManagement (OPM) on October 20, 2020. He stated that his financial troubles started in \nSeptember 2014 because his position was changed from hourly to salary, resulting in a \n$20,000 annual salary loss. Before September 2014, his annual salary was approximately \n$120,000. In 2016, he was demoted, reducing his annual income to about $60,000. \nAlthough he tried cutting costs, because of his diminished income, he was unable to keep \nup with his monthly payments. He sought legal guidance and was advised to file for \nbankruptcy. Some bankruptcy payments were made, but he could not sustain making \nthem while also making vehicle payments, as well as payments for food, shelter, and \nutilities. The bankruptcy was dismissed in 2019. (Item 3, at 2) \nWhen questioned about a variety of accounts in his name, Applicant was generally \nunaware of the specifics of the accounts, or the accounts in general, and claimed that \nsome of the accounts belonged to his wife. He contended that several of the accounts \nhad been, or should have been, resolved. (Item 3, at 2-4) At the time of the interview, \nApplicant acknowledged that he had previously been promoted, and that his annual salary \nhad increased to $81,000; that he had sold his house, and he was renting at a lower rate; \nand that because he had inherited his deceased parents\u2019 residence, he would move into \nit to save even more money. He anticipated offering his creditors lump-sum payments in \nan effort to settle and resolve his delinquent debts. However, he had not yet approached \nany of his creditors in an effort to resolve those debts. (Item 3, at 2) \nIn addition to an allegation pertaining to the bankruptcy filing and dismissal, the \nSOR alleged 13 still-delinquent accounts totaling approximately $69,822, as set forth \nbelow: \nSOR \u00b6 1.b. refers to unpaid federal taxes in the amount of approximately $647 for \nthe years 2015 and 2016. A proof of claim was filed by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) \nas part of the bankruptcy proceedings, but, contrary to Applicant\u2019s assertion, no payment \nwas ever made. (Item 8, at 2; Item 9) The account has not been resolved. \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c. and 1.d. refer to unpaid state taxes in the amounts of approximately \n$561 (for 2016) and $881 (for 2017).

(Item 4, at 2; Item 5, at 2) It is \nunclear if the particular account was specifically included in the bankruptcy because, \nwhile there was another account with the same creditor, there are no matching unpaid \nbalances or account numbers.

He failed to indicate what efforts he made to resolve the \naccount since the bankruptcy was dismissed.

In the absence of such information, I am unable to determine if he has any \nmonthly remainder available for savings or spending. In response to the FORM, he \nindicated that he was repairing the house he inherited and was not yet in a position to \nenter into agreements with his creditors. There is a paucity of evidence to indicate that \nhis financial problems are now under control, and it is difficult to determine if Applicant is \ncurrently in a better position financially than he had been. \nPolicies \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the Executive \nBranch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security emphasizing, \n\u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d (Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. \n518, 528 (1988)) As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to control \naccess to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual \nis sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information. The President has \nauthorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant an applicant eligibility for \naccess to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to do so.\u201d (Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \nIndustry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified.) \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the guidelines in SEAD 4. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the guidelines list potentially disqualifying \nconditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility \nfor access to classified information. \nAn administrative judge need not view the guidelines as inflexible, ironclad rules \nof law. Instead, acknowledging the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. The entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known \nas the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a meaningful decision. \nIn the decision-making process, facts must be established by \u201csubstantial \nevidence.\u201d \u201cSubstantial evidence [is] such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might \naccept as adequate to support a conclusion in light of all contrary evidence in the record.\u201d  \n(ISCR Case No. 04-11463 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2006) (citing Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1))  \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d  (See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th  Cir. 1994)) \nThe Government initially has the burden of producing evidence to establish a \npotentially disqualifying condition under the Directive, and has the burden of establishing \n6 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n      \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Once the Government has produced substantial \nevidence of a disqualifying condition, under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant has the \nburden of persuasion to present evidence in refutation, explanation, extenuation or \nmitigation, sufficient to overcome the doubts raised by the Government\u2019s case. The \nburden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government. (See ISCR \nCase No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sept. 22, 2005)) \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours as well. It is \nbecause of this special relationship that the Government must be able to repose a high \ndegree of trust and confidence in those individuals to whom it grants access to classified \ninformation. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the \napplicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. Such \ndecisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather \nthan actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Furthermore, \u201csecurity clearance \ndeterminations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d (Egan, 484 U.S. at 531) \nClearance decisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense \nbe a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d (See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 \n7) Thus, nothing in this decision should be construed to suggest that I have based this \ndecision, in whole or in part, on any express or implied determination as to Applicant\u2019s \nallegiance, loyalty, or patriotism. It is merely an indication the Applicant has or has not \nmet the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for \nissuing a clearance.  In reaching this decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that \nare reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I \nhave avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \n7 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts;  \n(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so; \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; \n(f) failure to . . . pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as required. \nIn addition to an allegation pertaining to the Chapter 13 bankruptcy filing and \ndismissal, the SOR alleged 13 still-delinquent accounts totaling approximately $69,822. \nApplicant attributed his inability to maintain those accounts in a current status to work-\nrelated issues that resulted in his annual income being reduced on a periodic basis from \n$120,000 in 2014 to about $60,000 in 2016. However, that information is at odds with the \ninformation he submitted in his bankruptcy petition. In 2015, his combined annual family \nincome was $110,490. The following year, the combined annual family income was \n$115,157. The inconsistencies in his income information raise questions as to both an \ninability to pay or an unwillingness to pay, and Applicant failed to fully address those \nissues. AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a), 19(b), 19(c), and 19(f) have been established. \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns arising from financial difficulties under AG \u00b6 20: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control;  \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; \n8 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue; and \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority \nto . . . pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those arrangements. \nNone of the mitigating conditions apply. During the period from 2014 until the \npresent, Applicant\u2019s combined annual family income was between $110,000 and\n$120,000. He had both an annual salary and a retirement pension, and at least during\nsome of those years, his wife\u2019s Social Security. While he did commence making payments\nvia his Chapter 13 bankruptcy plan to hold off collection efforts by numerous creditors,\nnearly all of those payments went towards his ongoing mortgage. Some payments went\nto a secured claim. Not one of the payments was ever sent to the creditors holding his\ndelinquent unsecured debts or federal or state taxes. Although he repeatedly stated that\nhe would address his delinquent debts over the past few years, as recently as November\n2021, he still claimed that he was not in a position to do so.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nA debt that became delinquent several years ago is still considered recent because \n\u201can applicant\u2019s ongoing, unpaid debts evidence a continuing course of conduct and, \ntherefore, can be viewed as recent for purposes of the Guideline F mitigating conditions.\u201d \n(ISCR Case No. 15-06532 at 3 (App. Bd. Feb. 16, 2017) (citing ISCR Case No. 15-01690 \nat 2 (App. Bd. Sept. 13, 2016)). While he did make payments under the bankruptcy plan \nto the bankruptcy trustee between 2018 and 2019, he stopped doing so, and the \nbankruptcy was dismissed. Between the date of the bankruptcy dismissal in August 2019 \nand the date of his response to the FORM in November 2021, he made no claimed or \nverifiable efforts to address any of the delinquent debts. \nBased on the evidence, it appears that Applicant actually ignored his delinquent \naccounts for a substantial multi-year period. Because of his failure to confirm payment of \neven his smallest delinquent account (a delinquent $561 state tax) and his failure to \nfurnish documentation regarding any of the accounts, the overwhelming evidence leads \nto the conclusion that his financial problems are not under control or that he is not truly \ninterested in resolving them. Other than his limited payment activities under the \nbankruptcy plan that ended in 2019, since then he has not acted responsibly by failing to \naddress his delinquent accounts and by failing to make limited, if any, efforts of working \nwith his creditors. The Appeal Board has previously commented on such a situation: \nEven if Applicant\u2019s financial difficulties initially arose, in whole or in part, due \nto circumstances outside his [or her] control, the Judge could still consider \nwhether Applicant has since acted in a reasonable manner when dealing \nwith those financial difficulties.

(See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 17-01213 at 5 (App. Bd. Jun. \n29, 2018); ISCR Case No. 17-00569 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Sept. 18, 2018) In this instance, \nApplicant has failed to offer any evidence that he has even begun making such efforts \nafter the bankruptcy was dismissed in August 2019 \u2013 over two years ago. \nClearance decisions are aimed at evaluating an applicant\u2019s judgment, reliability, \nand trustworthiness. They are not a debt-collection procedure. The guidelines do not \nrequire an applicant to establish resolution of every debt or issue alleged in the SOR. An \napplicant needs only to establish a plan to resolve financial problems and take significant \nactions to implement the plan. There is no requirement that an applicant immediately \nresolve issues or make payments on all delinquent debts simultaneously, nor is there a \nrequirement that the debts or issues alleged in an SOR be resolved first. Rather, a \nreasonable plan and concomitant conduct may provide for the payment of such debts, or \nresolution of such issues, one at a time. Mere promises to pay debts in the future, without \nfurther confirmed action, are insufficient. In this instance, since the bankruptcy was \ndismissed, Applicant offered no specifics regarding any repayment efforts; submitted no \ndocumentary evidence to reflect any payments made; and only made promises of \nproposed actions. Not one delinquent debt has been resolved. \nThe nature, frequency, and recency of Applicant\u2019s financial difficulties, and his \ngeneral failure to voluntarily and timely start to resolve them after August 2019, is \nsufficient to conclude that his financial difficulties were not infrequent. The timeliness of \nhis efforts to resolve his debts is not good, and the delay in commencing to do so, is \nanother negative factor. \nThe Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a good-faith effort to \nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts: \nIn order to qualify for application of [the \u201cgood-faith\u201d mitigating condition], an \napplicant must present evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or some other good-faith action aimed at resolving the \napplicant\u2019s debts. The Directive does not define the term \u201cgood-faith.\u201d \nHowever, the Board has indicated that the concept of good-faith \u201crequires \na showing that a person acts in a way that shows reasonableness, \nprudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.\u201d  \n(internal citation and footnote omitted) ISCR Case No. 02-30304 at 3 (App. Bd.

See ISCR Case No. 09-08533 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Oct. 6, 2010). \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. Moreover, I have \nevaluated the various aspects of this case in light of the totality of the record evidence \nand have not merely performed a piecemeal analysis. See U.S. v. Bottone, 365 F.2d 389, \n392 (2d Cir. 1966); see also ISCR Case No. 03-22861 at 2-3 (App. Bd. Jun. 2, 2006). \nThere is some evidence in favor of mitigating Applicant\u2019s financial considerations. \nApplicant is a 65-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has been serving as a \nproject manager with his current employer since August 2014. He was previously \nemployed by other employers in similar positions and as a security officer. He is a 1974 \nhigh school graduate. He was apparently granted a top secret clearance in 2020. In an \neffort to resolve some delinquent accounts, in November 2017, he voluntarily filed for \nbankruptcy under Chapter 13, and subsequently made payments under a bankruptcy \nplan. \nThe disqualifying evidence under the whole-person concept is simply more \nsubstantial and compelling. Applicant\u2019s bankruptcy was dismissed because of his failure \nor refusal to continue making payments under the bankruptcy plan. While he did \ncommence making payments via his Chapter 13 bankruptcy plan to hold off collection \nefforts by numerous creditors, nearly all of those payments went towards his ongoing \nmortgage. Some payments went to a secured claim. Not one of the payments was ever \nsent to the creditors holding his delinquent unsecured debts or federal or state taxes. He \nhas 13 still-delinquent accounts totaling approximately $69,822, and not one of those \naccounts was ever addressed either before or after the bankruptcy, and to this day, over \ntwo years after the bankruptcy was dismissed, he still has ignored each and every one of \nthem, including a delinquent state tax of only $561. Although he repeatedly stated that he \nwould address his delinquent debts over the past few years, and has had a combined \n11 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nannual family income of between $110,000 and $120,000, as recently as November 2021, \nhe still claimed that he was not in a position to do so. \nBecause of Applicant\u2019s failure to confirm any payments, and his failure to furnish \ndocumentation regarding any of the accounts, the overwhelming evidence leads to the \nconclusion that his financial problems are not under control. He has not acted responsibly \nby failing to address his delinquent accounts while employed and by failing to make \nlimited, if any, efforts of working with his creditors. There are lingering questions if \nApplicant is currently in a better position financially than he had been, as well as \ncontinuing doubt about his current reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. \nIn ISCR Case No. 07-06482 at 2-3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008), the Appeal Board \naddressed a key element in the whole-person analysis in financial cases stating: \nIn evaluating Guideline F cases, the Board has previously noted that the \nconcept of \u201cmeaningful track record\u201d necessarily includes evidence of actual \ndebt reduction through payment of debts. However, an applicant is not \nrequired, as a matter of law, to establish that he [or she] has paid off each \nand every debt listed in the SOR. All that is required is that an applicant \ndemonstrate that he [or she] has \u201c. . . established a plan to resolve his [or \nher] financial problems and taken significant actions to implement that plan.\u201d \nThe Judge can reasonably consider the entirety of an applicant\u2019s financial \nsituation and his [or her] actions in evaluating the extent to which that \napplicant\u2019s plan for the reduction of his outstanding indebtedness is credible \nand realistic. See Directive \u00b6 E2.2(a) (\u201cAvailable, reliable information about \nthe person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, should be \nconsidered in reaching a determination.\u201d) There is no requirement that a \nplan provide for payments on all outstanding debts simultaneously. Rather, \na reasonable plan (and concomitant conduct) may provide for the payment \nof such debts one at a time. Likewise, there is no requirement that the first \ndebts actually paid in furtherance of a reasonable debt plan be the ones \nlisted in the SOR. \nWith the exception of his limited payment activities under the bankruptcy plan, \nApplicant\u2019s track record of zero verifiable efforts to resolve the debts and the lengthy \nperiod of non-contact with his creditors is negative and disappointing. Overall, the \nevidence leaves me with substantial questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and \nsuitability for a security clearance. For all of these reasons, I conclude Applicant has failed \nto mitigate the security concerns arising from his financial considerations. See SEAD 4, \nApp. A, \u00b6\u00b6 2(d) (1) through AG 2(d) (9). \n12 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                        \n         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a. through 1.n.: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

The most recent information available indicates that he is married for the \nthird time with a three-year-old child. (Items 3, 4) \nThe SOR alleges 23 delinquent debts totaling about $57,000. The debts are \nestablished through Applicant\u2019s admissions and a January 2021 credit report. (Items 2\u00ad\n5) \nApplicant attributed his financial difficulties to a 2019 layoff after a downturn in \nthe industry in which he worked. He stated that his employment has stabilized since \n2019, as has his finances. He is paying his current bills and increasing his credit score, \nbut he does not intend to pay his delinquent debts. A financial counselor advised him \nnot to pay the debts because the debts would fall off of his credit report faster if he did \nnot pay them. (Items 2-4) \nPolicies \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG), which became \neffective on June 8, 2017. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR.

This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds.  \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; \n(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant has a history of financial problems, including multiple delinquent debts. \nHe was unable to pay his debts for a period, but that changed to an unwillingness to \nsatisfy his debts. The evidence is sufficient to raise the above disqualifying conditions. \nConditions that could mitigate the financial considerations security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 20. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment;  \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control; and \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nApplicant attributed his financial difficulties to a 2019 layoff after a downturn in \nthe industry in which he worked. That qualifies as a condition that was largely beyond \nhis control. He stated that his employment has stabilized since 2019, as has his \nfinances. He is paying his current bills and increasing his credit score. He is following a \nfinancial counselor\u2019s advice not to pay the delinquent debts, because the debts will fall \noff of his credit report faster if he does not pay them. \nThere is insufficient evidence for a determination that Applicant\u2019s financial \nproblems will be resolved within a reasonable period. I am unable to find that he acted \nresponsibly under the circumstances or that he made a good-faith effort to pay his \ndebts. His financial issues are recent and ongoing. They continue to cast doubt on his \ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. None of the mitigating conditions \nare applicable. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.

I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline F in my whole-person analysis. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude Applicant did not \nmitigate the financial considerations security concerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.w: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIt is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for \na security clearance.

At that time, his case was dismissed by the Defense Office of \nHearings and Appeals (DOHA) for lack of jurisdiction. Subsequently, Applicant gained \nemployment with a contractor, which renewed sponsorship for his clearance.

The scheduling of this hearing was delayed because of the COVID-\n19 pandemic. DOHA issued a notice of hearing on October 26, 2021, and the hearing \nwas convened as scheduled on November 17, 2021. The Government offered exhibits \n(GE) 1 through 10, which were admitted into evidence without objection. The \nGovernment\u2019s exhibit list was marked as a hearing exhibit (HE I). Applicant and his wife \ntestified, and he offered exhibits (AE) 1(a-f) through 14, which were admitted without \nobjection. Applicant\u2019s exhibit list was marked as HE II. The record was kept open to allow \nApplicant to submit additional evidence, which he did in the form of AE 1.g and 15, which \nwere admitted without objection. DOHA received the hearing transcript (Tr.) on November \n29, 2021.  \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant admitted all but one of the SOR allegations, with explanations. His \nadmissions are incorporated into these findings of fact. After a review of the pleadings \nand evidence, I make the following additional findings of fact. \nApplicant is a 39-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has worked for \nhis current employer since 2017. He has been promoted several times while working for \nthis contractor. He served in the U.S. Air Force on active duty for 15 years and was \nhonorably discharged in late 2016 as a staff sergeant (E-5). He was separated because \nof not making promotion to the next rank, E-6. He was unemployed for about one year \nafter his military separation. He receives service-connected disability payments from the \nDepartment of Veterans Affairs (VA) rated at 80 percent. He has an associate\u2019s degree. \nHe has been married for 17 years and has two children, ages 19 and 15. (Tr. at 7, 27-30) \nThe SOR alleged that Applicant had four charged-off debts, a foreclosure, and a \njudgment totaling approximately $30,494. (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.f) The debts are established by \nApplicant\u2019s admissions, court documents, and entries on several credit reports. Two of \nthe listed SOR debts (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and1.f) refer to the same underlying debt. I will consider \nonly one debt and find for the Applicant on the duplicate debt (See GE 8, p. 2, entry 1). \n(GE 3-10; Answer to SOR) \nBy his own admission, Applicant\u2019s financial difficulties were partly caused by his \nfamily living outside their means when he was in the Air Force. He essentially lived on the \nsame pay for about 11 years because of his lack of promotion. Additionally, his wife \nsuffers from a bipolar disorder. When he was deployed to a combat zone. she fell into a \ndepressive state and self-medicated by going on spending binges, while simultaneously \nneglecting the family household finances. His year of unemployment in 2017, after his \ndischarge, also contributed to his financial problems.

Applicant incurred this \ndebt in 2012. The creditor for this original debt was a bank. When Applicant became \ndelinquent on the debt he tried to negotiate a payment plan with the bank but it refused \nto accept anything other than full payment. In November 2019, Applicant entered into a \npayment plan with the successor collector and documented 19 continuous payments of \nat least $225 since then. This debt is being resolved. (Tr. 35, 39; GE 8; AE 8; Answer to \nSOR). \nSOR \u00b6 1.b-$3,143. Applicant incurred this debt when the family had their furniture \ndamaged and subsequently purchased new items on credit. No payment arrangements \nhave been established for this debt. Applicant credibly asserted that once some of his \nother debts are resolved, he will address this debt. (Tr. 39; Answer to SOR) \nSOR \u00b6 1.c-$836. Applicant incurred this debt from a line of credit in 2009. No \npayment arrangements have been established for this debt. Applicant credibly asserted \nthat once some of his other debts are resolved, he will address this debt. (Tr. 42; Answer \nto SOR) \nSOR \u00b6 1.d-$14,812. Applicant incurred this debt when a vehicle was repossessed, \nsold, and he was left with a deficiency balance. He negotiated a payment plan with a \nsuccessor collector in November 2021 and documented making his first $102 payment \nunder the plan. This debt is being resolved. (Tr. 40-41; AE 14-15) \nSOR \u00b6 1.e-$2,324. Applicant incurred this debt through a home loan secured by a \nmortgage. He bought the home when he was stationed at an Air Force base with limited \nhousing. When it was time to rotate to a new assignment, he could not sell the house \nbecause the base had downsized its military population and the market was flooded with \nhomes for sale. This led to him ultimately defaulting on the loan and the creditor \nforeclosed on the property, which was sold through this process, thereby resolving the \nunderlying debt. No deficiency resulted for Applicant. Applicant\u2019s latest credit report \ncorroborates that no amount is owed. This debt is resolved. (Tr. 31-32, 35, 42-43; GE 8; \nAE 8; Answer to SOR) \nSOR \u00b6 1.f-$4,431. This is the same underlying debt as listed in \u00b6 1.a above. This \nallegation reflects the judgment on the debt that the creditor obtained. This debt is \nresolved. (Tr. 39, 42-44; GE 8; AE 8; Answer to SOR) \nApplicant credibly testified that he is currently in good financial shape. He \ndocumented that he is current on his car payments, that he adheres to a monthly budget, \nand he provided a spreadsheet showing his plan to repay his remaining debts. He also \ncontracted with a debt management company (DMC), which monitors his credit reports \nand disputes any questionable entries. The DMC also offers him advice on strategies to \nhelp his financial wellbeing. His yearly gross income is approximately $106,000 and he \nhas approximately $1,400 in savings and $25,000 in his retirement account.

(Tr. 45-47, 49-52, 54-\n55, 59; AE 13, 15) \nApplicant provided character letters from six current coworkers and one from an \nAir Force colleague. All attest to his trustworthiness, loyalty, and work ethic. They \nrecommend his clearance approval. (AE 1.a-1.g) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation about potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nAG \u00b6 18 expresses the security concern for financial considerations: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. I have \nconsidered all of them under AG \u00b6 19 and the following potentially apply: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant had multiple delinquent debts that were unpaid or unresolved. Both of \nthe above disqualifying conditions are raised by the evidence. \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising \nfrom financial difficulties. I have considered all of the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 \nand the following potentially apply: \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n       \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue. \nApplicant\u2019s financial difficulties came about because of circumstances within his \ncontrol (not being promoted for 11 years by the Air Force and overspending when he was \non a fixed income) and circumstances beyond his control (his wife\u2019s bipolar condition \nleading her to binge-spend while he was deployed, not being able to sell his house due \nto market conditions, and his year of unemployment after his discharge from the Air \nForce). Applicant eventually acted responsibly by entering into debt payment plans for \nthe two largest delinquent debts and credibly setting forth his plan to address the other \ntwo debts. He documented that the underlying home loan was paid through the \nforeclosure sale and he has no more responsibility for it. While his financial state is not \nperfect, that is not the requirement. He has established a track record of steady payments \nto reduce his delinquent debts. There are clear indications that his debts are being \nresolved and that he is making good-faith efforts to do so. All of the above mitigating \nconditions substantially apply. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guideline and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nrelevant facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 \n2(d) were addressed under that guideline, but some warrant additional comment. I \nconsidered Applicant\u2019s military service, his service in a deployment combat area, and the \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nstrong recommendations of his coworkers. While Applicant could have been timelier in \nhis resolution of his debts, he eventually addressed them, except for two that will be \naddressed in the future. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant mitigated the financial considerations security concerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs: 1.a-1.f: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security clearance. \nEligibility for access to classified information is granted. \nRobert E.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant is 54 years old, has never married, and has two adult children. She received her high school diploma in 1985 and a certificate from a law enforcement training center in 1998. She attended college classes from 2002 to 2008, but was not awarded an undergraduate degree. Since 2016 she has been employed as a litigation analyst. According to her e-QIP and the report summarizing her background interview, she has been unemployed only for two brief periods since 2009; i.e., July to November 2014 and October 2016 to January 2017. She has twice been granted eligibility for a security clearance at the top secret level, first in 1998 and then in 2012. She seeks to obtain eligibility again in connection with her current employment. (Item 3 at 12-25, 28, 30-31, 37-39; Item 2 at 2; Item 17 at 2.) Paragraph 1 (Guideline F, Financial Considerations) The Government alleged in this paragraph of the SOR that Applicant is ineligible for a clearance because she is financially overextended and therefore potentially unreliable, untrustworthy, or at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. The SOR alleged that she has voluntarily filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy relief three times, specifically in 1991 (1.a), 2010 (1.b), and 2018 (1.f). Her debts were discharged in each case.

(Item 2.) \nShe attached one document and requested her case be decided on the written record in \nlieu of a hearing. In her Answer Applicant admitted with explanations eight of the nine \nSOR allegations and denied one allegation. The SOR does not include an allegation \nunder the heading 1.d. On March 17, 2022, Department Counsel submitted the \nDepartment\u2019s written case. A complete copy of the file of relevant material (FORM), \nincluding documents marked as Items 1 to 17, was provided to Applicant, who received \nthe file on May 5, 2022. \nApplicant was given 30 days from receipt of the FORM to raise objections and \nsubmit material in refutation, extenuation, or mitigation. Applicant did not reply to the \nFORM nor did she submit any additional documentation. Department Counsel\u2019s Items 1 \nthrough 17 are admitted into evidence. The case was assigned to me on August 4, 2022. \nBased upon a review of the pleadings and the Government\u2019s evidence, national security \neligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant is 54 years old, has never married, and has two adult children. She \nreceived her high school diploma in 1985 and a certificate from a law enforcement training \ncenter in 1998. She attended college classes from 2002 to 2008, but was not awarded an \nundergraduate degree. Since 2016 she has been employed as a litigation analyst. \nAccording to her e-QIP and the report summarizing her background interview, she has \nbeen unemployed only for two brief periods since 2009; i.e., July to November 2014 and \nOctober 2016 to January 2017. She has twice been granted eligibility for a security \nclearance at the top secret level, first in 1998 and then in 2012. She seeks to obtain \neligibility again in connection with her current employment. (Item 3 at 12-25, 28, 30-31, \n37-39; Item 2 at 2; Item 17 at 2.) \nParagraph 1 (Guideline F, Financial Considerations) \nThe Government alleged in this paragraph of the SOR that Applicant is ineligible \nfor a clearance because she is financially overextended and therefore potentially \nunreliable, untrustworthy, or at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. \nThe SOR alleged that she has voluntarily filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy relief three times, \nspecifically in 1991 (1.a), 2010 (1.b), and 2018 (1.f). Her debts were discharged in each \ncase. The SOR also alleged that she filed for Chapter 13 bankruptcy relief two times, in \nJanuary 2015 (1.c) and August 2015 (1.e). In both cases the Chapter 13 bankruptcy \npetitions were dismissed. The SOR alleged two tax debts owed to her state of residence \n(State 1). For tax year (TY) 2010, she is alleged to owe approximately $8,497 (1.g), and \nfor TY 2012, she is alleged to owe approximately $7,696 (1.h). SOR 1.h also alleged that \nState 1 has imposed a tax lien on Applicant for the delinquent taxes due for TY 2012.

(Answer at 1.) \nThe SOR listed a ninth allegation stating that Applicant is indebted to State 1 for a \njudgment entered against her in July 2015 in the amount of $14,770 for unemployment \nbenefits that she fraudulently received. (1.j) In her Answer, she denied that she committed \nfraud in receiving unemployment benefits and claimed that she never received notice of \na hearing on State 1\u2019s request for a judgment. (Item 2 at 1.) \nThe details of the nine SOR allegations are as follows: \n1.a. 1991 Chapter 7 Bankruptcy Petition and Discharge. Applicant filed this \nbankruptcy petition in July 1991 and her debts were discharged in December 1991. In her \nAnswer, Applicant explained that she suffered an on-the-job injury in 1989 and was \nunable to work. In 1990 she became a single parent and experienced financial difficulties. \nShe filed for bankruptcy \u201cto get a fresh start.\u201d (Item 2 at 1; Item 4.) \n1.b. 2010 Chapter 7 Bankruptcy Petition and Discharge. This petition was filed in\nJanuary 2010. Applicant\u2019s debts of $731,611.57 were discharged in May 2010. She was \nemployed as a security guard at that time. She also owned a part-time seasonal business, \nwhich she started in 2003. In her Answer, she wrote that a bad economy forced her to file \nthis bankruptcy petition to \u201csalvage what I could of a life for myself and my children.\u201d She \nfurther explained that at that time she had a large mortgage, four work vehicles, two \npersonal vehicles, a warehouse, and two young children. (Item 2 at 1; Item 3 at 40; Item \n5.) \n \n1.c January 2015 Chapter 13 Bankruptcy Petition. Applicant wrote in her answer \nthat she filed this petition \u201cto stave off creditors because [she] had yet to fully recover from \nthe economic crash of 2009/2010.\u201d She was also solely responsible for a child in college. \nShe claimed that she filed this petition due to \u201cbad advice\u201d of an attorney. In July 2015, \nthe petition was dismissed upon Applicant\u2019s request that her Chapter 13 plan not be \napproved. (Item 2 at 1; Item 3 at 40; Item 6.) \n1.d. The SOR contains no allegation under this heading. \n1.e. August 2015 Chapter 13 Bankruptcy Petition. In August 2015, the same \nattorney filed a second Chapter 13 petition on behalf of Applicant. In September 2015, \nApplicant filed an Amended plan under Chapter 13. Applicant submitted four amended \nplans, and in July 2016 the bankruptcy court entered an order denying confirmation of \nApplicant\u2019s plan due to her failure to fulfill a condition for confirmation. The case was \ndismissed in October 2016. In her Answer, Applicant wrote that both Chapter 13 petitions \nwere filed as part of \u201ca plan to buy me time until I was eligible to file a Chap 7 [debt \ndischarge petition] again.\u201d (Item 2 at 1; Item 7.) \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n1.f. 2018 Chapter 7 Bankruptcy Petition and 2018 Discharge. Applicant filed a pro \nse Chapter 7 petition in November 2018. She successfully discharged $138,058 of debts \nin March 2019 with no distribution of any assets. The record reflects that Appellant was \nemployed by one Government contractor as a Personnel Security Manager starting in \nJanuary 2017 until June 2018 and by a second Government contractor with the same title \nin June 2018. The most recent information in the record is from June 2018, when a \nTriggered Enhanced Subject Interview of Applicant was conducted by investigators of the \nOffice of Personnel Management. In her November 2018 bankruptcy petition, she did not \nlist any employer, but provided information about her personal business, which had a \nname similar to the business she claimed in her e-QIP she sold in December 2014. Her \npetition reflects monthly income of $1,391. (Item 3 at 18-19; Item 8; Item 9 at 2, 8; Item \n17 at 2.) \n1.g State 1 Unpaid Taxes Due in the Amount of $8,497 for TY 2010. Applicant \nasserts in the Answer that she has resolved this tax debt with installment payments. She \nprovided a letter from State 1, dated March 14, 2022, that confirms she has no \noutstanding tax obligations to State 1. This debt is resolved. (Item 3 at 42; Item 15; Item \n16.) \n1.h. State 1 Tax Lien Entered against Applicant in the Amount of 7,696 for TY \n2012. See 1.g, above. This debt is resolved. (Item 3 at Item 15; Item 16; Item 17 at 7.) \n1.i. Federal Unpaid Taxes Due in the Amount of $14,022 for TYs 2011 and 2013. \nApplicant admitted this debt in her Answer, but claimed that the debt has been resolved. \nShe was only able to provide limited records to substantiate her claim due to the \nunavailability of records from the IRS for TY 2011 and earlier. She provided a tax account \ntranscript for TY 2013 that shows that the IRS wrote off her debt of $10,630 in April 2019. \nThe TY 2013 tax debt is resolved, but was not paid. There is no record evidence to \nsupport her claim of resolution of the TY 2011 tax debt. (Item 14 at 4-5; Item 15 at 1,) \n1.j. July 9, 2015 State 1\u2019s Judgment in the Approximate Amount of $14,770 for \nFraudulently Receiving Unemployment Benefits. This debt is not resolved. This judgment \nwas entered against Applicant by the Bankruptcy court as part of her Chapter 13 \nproceeding. State 1 filed an adversary proceeding against Applicant. In its Complaint to \nDetermine Dischargeability of a Debt, State 1 alleged that Applicant fraudulent \nrepresented that she was eligible and remained eligible to receive unemployment \nbenefits. The requirement for eligibility was that Applicant be unemployed while receiving \nbenefits. State 1 alleged that while Applicant was receiving unemployment benefits, she \nwas actually employed during the period November 2011 through July 2012. In her \nAnswer Applicant claimed that \u201cshe had no idea what this debt was about.\u201d She also \nclaims that she never committed any fraud and was in the process of investigating the \nmatter further. I note that Applicant was represented by counsel in her bankruptcy \nproceeding and the summary of filings in that proceeding reflect that State 1\u2019s complaint \ninitiating the adversary proceeding was filed on May 4, 2015. This judgment is not \nresolved.

Also, she provided no information detailing her plans for \nresolving her past-due indebtedness or demonstrating other indicia of trustworthiness. \nParagraph 2 (Guideline E, Personal Conduct) \n2.a. The Government cross-alleged in this paragraph the SOR allegation set forth \nin 1.j, above. \nApplicant denied committing any fraud by collecting unemployment benefits from \nState 1 during the period involved, November 2011 to July 2012. The record evidence \nsupports the claim of State 1 that Applicant was employed during those months. Her \nclaims for unemployment benefits during that period were not valid due to her \nemployment. Applicant wrote in her Answer that that she made an inquiry of State 1 \nregarding this issue and was waiting to hear back. She provided no additional or follow-\nup information or documentation. (Item 2 at 1.)  \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for national security eligibility, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines (AG) list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. The entire \nprocess is a conscientious scrutiny of applicable guidelines in the context of a number of \nvariables known as the whole-person concept. The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires, \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. I have not drawn inferences based on mere speculation or \nconjecture. \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.14, requires the Government to present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, \u201cThe applicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d  \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants national \nsecurity eligibility. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the \napplicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as \nto potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified or sensitive information. \nFinally, as emphasized in Section 7 of Executive Order 10865, \u201cAny determination under \nthis order adverse to an applicant shall be a determination in terms of the national interest \nand shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d \nSee also Executive Order 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information.) \nAnalysis \nParagraph 1 (Guideline F, Financial Considerations) \nThe security concerns relating to the guideline for financial considerations are set \nout in AG \u00b6 18, which reads in pertinent part: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAG \u00b6 19 describes four conditions that could raise security concerns and may be \ndisqualifying in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(d) deceptive or illegal financial practices such as embezzlement, employee \ntheft, check fraud, expense account fraud, mortgage fraud, filing deceptive \nloan statements and other intentional financial breaches of trust; and \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired. \nApplicant has admitted to a long history of multiple bankruptcy discharges dating \nback to 1991 and 2010 and as recently as 2018. She has also admitted to delinquent tax \npayments and has an outstanding tax obligation. The record evidence also establishes \nthat she fraudulently collected unemployment benefits while she was employed and \nineligible for benefits. All of the above potentially disqualifying conditions apply. \nAccordingly, the burden shifts to Applicant to mitigate the security concerns raised \nby the above financial considerations. The guideline includes five conditions in AG \u00b6 20 \nthat could mitigate the security concerns arising from Applicant\u2019s financial difficulties: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the\nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts;  \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \ntaken to resolve the issue; and  \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority \nto file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \nAG \u00b6 20(a) has not been established. Applicant\u2019s financial behavior is recent, \nfrequent, and occurred over many years and a variety of circumstances, rendering them \nlikely to recur and casts doubt on her reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(b) is only partially established. Applicant claims that she experienced \nfinancial hardship during and as a result of the economic recession of 2009, which caused \nher to file for the discharge of her debts in 2010 through bankruptcy. She provided no \nconvincing evidence that once she was free of her debts in 2010 that she experienced \nany circumstances beyond her control that caused her financial hardship over the \nsubsequent years when she failed to pay her state and Federal taxes as required, \nfraudulently obtained unemployment benefits in State 1, and had her subsequent debts \ndischarged again in 2018. Applicant failed to act responsibly for a number of years after \n2010 and still at this time is indebted to State 1 on a judgment for over $14,000 for \nfraudulently obtained unemployment benefits. \nAG \u00b6 20(d) has not been established. Applicant provided evidence that she has \nresolved her state tax debts, but has not paid her Federal tax debts. Her 2013 tax debt of \n$10,630 was written off by the IRS and she provided no evidence of a resolution of her \n2011 tax debt. In addition, she has provided no evidence of payments to State 1 to resolve \nthe state\u2019s judgment against her or actions taken to otherwise resolve that debt. \nAG \u00b6 20(e) has not been established. She disputes the State\u2019s claim that she \nfraudulently obtained unemployment benefits, but she has provided no documentation to \nshow that she has a reasonable basis to dispute this debt and has in fact followed up with \nState 1 to challenge the judgment. \nAG \u00b6 20(g) has only been partially established. As noted, she has paid her tax \ndelinquent debt to State 1, but has not provided any evidence of payments of her Federal \ntax debts. \nParagraph 2 (Guideline E, Personal Conduct) \nThe security concerns relating to the guideline for personal conduct are set out in \nAG \u00b6 15, which states: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. \nAG \u00b6 16 describes a condition that could raise security concerns and may be \ndisqualifying in this case: \n(c) credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is \nnot sufficient for an adverse determination under any other single guideline, \nbut which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-person \nassessment of questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nof candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations, or other \ncharacteristics indicating that the individual may not properly safeguard \nclassified or sensitive information. \nThe Government\u2019s evidence establishes its allegation that State 1 has obtained a \njudgment against Applicant for obtaining unemployment benefits under false pretenses. \nThe guideline includes two conditions in AG \u00b6 17 that could mitigate the security concerns \narising from the circumstances surrounding State 1\u2019s judgment against Applicant. Those \npotentially mitigating conditions are the following: \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; and  \n(f) the information was unsubstantiated or from a source of questionable \nreliability. \nThe record evidence does not support application of either condition. Applicant has \nnot provided any evidence to support her dispute that the judgment was erroneously \nentered. It was entered in connection with her January 2015 Chapter 7 bankruptcy by a \nU.S. Bankruptcy Judge in a proceeding in which she was represented by counsel. \nApplicant\u2019s claim that she knows nothing about the judgment is not credible. The \ninformation in this allegation is substantiated and from a reliable source. Moreover, the \noffense underlying the judgment is not minor and casts doubt on Applicant\u2019s reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and good judgment.  \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s potential for national security eligibility by considering the totality of the \napplicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should \nconsider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n                                                \n \n \n \n \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant national security \neligibility for a security clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon \ncareful consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI have considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of \nall pertinent facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant has not mitigated \nthe security concerns raised by her extensive history of unpaid debts and personal \nmisconduct. Overall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s suitability for national security eligibility and a security clearance. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a through 1.c: \nAgainst Applicant \nNo subparagraph 1.d \nSubparagraphs 1.e and1.f:  \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.g and 1.h: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.i and 1.j:  \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline E: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 2.a: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s national \nsecurity eligibility for a security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is \ndenied. \nJOHN BAYARD GLENDON \nAdministrative Judge \n10 \n",

(GE \n2) \nApplicant was stopped for a traffic citation in September 2017. The deputy \nnoticed the smell of unburnt marijuana and saw something suspicious in the cup holder. \nApplicant stated that it was an old pipe that he used to smoke tobacco. When he was \nhanded the pipe, the deputy saw burnt marijuana residue, and it smelled like burnt \nmarijuana. Applicant admitted to smoking \u201cbud\u201d that day.

(Tr. at 15, \n16, 38-39; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 2, 3, 15) \nApplicant held a security clearance at the time. He self-reported the charge and \nits disposition to his security officer in November 2017. He indicated that he purchased \nthe marijuana and smoked it in a state where it was legal under state law. He \ntransported it to his state, where it was not legal under state law. He falsely stated that \nhe had not used illegal drugs on any other occasions since 1979. (Tr. at 15, 26; GE 3, \n15) \nApplicant was going through airport security in his home state in January 2018. A \nsmall knife and a pipe with marijuana residue was found after his carry-on bag was x-\nrayed. The small metal pipe was wrapped in a napkin in a ziplock bag inside a toiletry \nbag. Airport police were notified. Applicant admitted to the police officer that the carry-\non bag and the ziplock bag was his. The officer asked him what was in the ziplock bag \nto which Applicant replied it was \u201ca small pipe that he had forgotten that was in his bag.\u201d \nHe also stated that he smoked tobacco. The police officer examined the pipe and \ndetermined based on his experience that the residue was burnt marijuana. Applicant \n17-04166 at 3 (App. Bd.

(Tr. at 31-39; GE 14) \nApplicant was cited with possession of drug paraphernalia, provided a court date, \nand permitted to board his flight. Applicant was found not guilty of the charge in April \n2019. (Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 14) \nApplicant testified that he borrowed the carry-on bag from his son, and he was \nunaware that the pipe was in the bag. He stated that he never asked his son about the \npipe because he did not want to worry his son. He denied telling the police officer that \nhe used the pipe to smoke marijuana. (Tr. at 31-39; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE \n14) I did not find his testimony credible. I find that the incident happened substantially as \nreported in the police report of the incident.  \nApplicant was interviewed by a background investigator in October 2018 about \nthe 2017 and 2018 citations and his marijuana use. He admitted that he used marijuana \nin college from 1978 to 1983, but he stated that he did not use it again until he \npossessed and used marijuana in July 2017. He discussed his September 2017 charge \nfor marijuana possession. He used marijuana three or four days while he was on \nvacation in July 2017, and again in September 2017. He stated those were the only \ntimes he used drugs while holding a security clearance. He stated that he had not used \nmarijuana at any other time, and he did not intend to use it in the future as it could derail \nhis career. (GE 2) \nApplicant discussed the January 2018 citation from the airport with the \ninvestigator. He stated that the pipe was not his, and he did not know how it got in his \nbag. He stated that it could belong to one of his children. (GE 2) \nApplicant denied that he provided false information during the interview. He \nstated that he told the truth and that it was not his pipe that was found at the airport. (Tr. \nat 31-39; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR) As indicated above, I did not find him credible. I \nfind that he lied to the investigator, and he provided additional false statements in the \nSOR response and during his hearing testimony. \nApplicant also has a history of workplace issues. An incident report was issued \nby an employer in February 1997 because Applicant \u201cdid not comply with company \npolicy of paying his [company] credit card in a timely manner and by using his credit \ncard for personal use.\u201d He stated that he paid the balance off in full, and no further \naction was required. He went to work for another defense contractor in August 1997, \nwhere he worked until he was terminated in May 2015 for unauthorized use of an \nemployer-issued credit card. (Tr. at 45-50; GE 6, 8, 10, 16) \nIn 2001, Applicant\u2019s employer counseled him for charging personal rental cars to \nthe company\u2019s corporate credit card without proper authority, for having an unpaid \nbalance on a corporate credit card, and for not repaying a cash advance from the \ncompany.

He is praised for his work ethic and sensitive \nhandling of classified information. (Applicant\u2019s response to SOR) \nPolicies \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG), which became \neffective on June 8, 2017. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline H, Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nThe security concern for drug involvement and substance misuse is set out in AG \n\u00b6 24: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior \nmay lead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. Controlled substance means any \u201ccontrolled substance\u201d \nas defined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term \nadopted in this guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 25. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) any substance misuse (see above definition); \n(c) illegal possession of a controlled substance, including cultivation, \nprocessing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of \ndrug paraphernalia; and \n(f) any illegal drug use while granted access to classified information or \nholding a sensitive position. \nApplicant possessed and used marijuana from about 1978 to 1982 while he was \nin college; once in December 2001 to January 2002; and again in 2017 and 2018.

He was cited for possession of marijuana or drug \nparaphernalia in 1979, 2002, 2017, and 2018. AG \u00b6\u00b6 25(a) and 25(c) are applicable.  \nSOR \u00b6 1.a alleges that Applicant \u201cused marijuana, with varying frequency, from \nabout 1978 to at least December 2017, to include after you were granted access to \nsensitive information.\u201d SOR \u00b6 1.a alleges conduct covered under AG \u00b6 25(a), but it \ndoes not allege the conduct identified in AG \u00b6 25(g), which covers illegal drug use \n\u201cwhile granted access to classified information or holding a sensitive position.\u201d \n(emphasis added) AG \u00b6 25(g) is not applicable. See ISCR Case No. 20-03111 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Aug. 10, 2022) for a discussion on the distinction between holding a security \nclearance and having access to classified information. \nAG \u00b6 26 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. The following \nare potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \nand \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this \nproblem, and has established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not \nlimited to: \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; \nand \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that any future \ninvolvement or misuse is grounds for revocation of national security \neligibility.  \nThere is no evidence of any illegal drug use after January 2018. There are no \nbright-line rules for when conduct is recent. All of Applicant\u2019s illegal drug use might be \nmitigated if I had found him credible, but I did not. His conduct continues to cast doubt \non his current reliability, trustworthiness, good judgment, and willingness to comply with \nlaws, rules, and regulations. The above mitigating conditions, individually or collectively, \nare insufficient to alleviate those concerns. \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct  \nThe security concern for personal conduct is set out in AG \u00b6 15, as follows: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process. \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. The following disqualifying conditions are potentially applicable: \n(b) deliberately providing false or misleading information; or concealing or \nomitting information, concerning relevant facts to an employer, \ninvestigator, security official, competent medical or mental health \nprofessional involved in making a recommendation relevant to a national \nsecurity \neligibility \ndetermination, \nor \nother \nofficial \ngovernment \nrepresentative;  \n(d) credible adverse information that is not explicitly covered under any \nother guideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an adverse \ndetermination, but which, when combined with all available information, \nsupports a whole-person assessment of questionable judgment, \nuntrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply \nwith rules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that the \nindividual may not properly safeguard classified or sensitive information. \nThis includes, but is not limited to, consideration of: \n(1) untrustworthy or unreliable behavior to include breach of client \nconfidentiality, release of proprietary information, unauthorized \nrelease of sensitive corporate or government protected information; \n(2) any disruptive, violent, or other inappropriate behavior; \n(3) a pattern of dishonesty or rule violations; and \n(4) evidence of significant misuse of Government or other \nemployer's time or resources; and \n(e) personal conduct, or concealment of information about one\u2019s conduct, \nthat creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress by a \nforeign intelligence entity or other individual or group. Such conduct \nincludes: \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(1) engaging in activities which, if known, could affect the person\u2019s \npersonal, professional, or community standing. \nAs a preface, I accept the police report as to what occurred in the airport in \nJanuary 2018, that Applicant admitted that he smoked marijuana, and that the last time \nhe smoked marijuana with the pipe was the previous month on Christmas. I also find \nthat Applicant intentionally provided false information during his background interview in \nOctober 2018 when he stated that the pipe was not his; he did not know how it got in his \nbag; and he had not used marijuana since September 2017. AG \u00b6 16(b) is applicable. \nApplicant was terminated in May 2015 for misuse of a company credit card. That \nconduct reflects questionable judgment and an unwillingness to comply with rules and \nregulations. The conduct also created vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, and \nduress. AG \u00b6\u00b6 16(d) and 16(e) are applicable. \nAG \u00b6 17 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. The following \nare potentially applicable: \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; \n(b) the refusal or failure to cooperate, omission, or concealment was \ncaused or significantly contributed to by advice of legal counsel or of a \nperson with professional responsibilities for advising or instructing the \nindividual specifically concerning security processes. Upon being made \naware of the requirement to cooperate or provide the information, the \nindividual cooperated fully and truthfully; \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, \nunreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely \nto recur; and \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate \nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress. \nApplicant denied that he lied during his background interview.

It would be inconsistent to find his conduct mitigated.3  \nAs to the termination in May 2015 for misuse of a company credit card. Had that \nbeen the only incident, it would likely be mitigated. However, he engaged in similar \nconduct at a different company in 1997, and in 2001 at the same company that \nterminated him. That company placed him \u201con permanent probation for any similar \nviolations,\u201d with the warning that \u201c[s]hould similar violations occur he will be immediately \nterminated.\u201d That history, coupled with the fact that his testimony cannot be trusted, \nprevents mitigation. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I have incorporated my \n3  See ISCR Case 03-22819 at 4 (App. Bd. Mar. 20, 2006), in which the Appeal Board reversed the \nAdministrative Judge\u2019s decision to grant Applicant\u2019s security clearance: \nOnce the Administrative Judge found that Applicant deliberately falsified a security \nclearance application in September 2002, the Judge could not render a favorable security \nclearance decision without articulating a rational basis for why it would be clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant \ndespite the falsification. Here, the Judge gives reasons as to why he considers the \nfalsification mitigated under a \u201cwhole person\u201d analysis, namely that Applicant has \nmatured, has held a position of responsibility, recognizes how important it is to be candid \nin relation to matters relating to her security clearance, and has changed her behavior so \nthat there is little likelihood of recurrence. However, the Judge\u2019s conclusion runs contrary \nto the Judge\u2019s rejection of Applicant\u2019s explanations for the security clearance application \nfalsification. At the hearing (after earlier admitting the falsification in her March 2003 \nwritten statement to a security investigator), Applicant testified that she had not \nintentionally falsified her application. Given the Judge\u2019s rejection of this explanation as \nnot being credible, it follows that the Judge could not have concluded Applicant now \nrecognizes the importance of candor and has changed her behavior. \n10 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \ncomments under Guidelines E and H in my whole-person analysis. I also considered \nApplicant\u2019s favorable character evidence, but he cannot be trusted to tell the truth. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude Applicant did not \nmitigate the security concerns under Guidelines E (personal conduct) and H (drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse). \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline H:  \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.f: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 2.a-2.c: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIt is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for \na security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nEdward W. Loughran \nAdministrative Judge \n11 \n",

Eligibility for a public trust position is denied. \nHistory of the Case \nApplicant submitted an electronic questionnaire for investigations processing (e-\nQIP) on October 17, 2016. On October 4, 2019, the Department of Defense Consolidated \nAdjudications Facility (DOD CAF) sent him a Statement of Reasons (SOR) alleging \ntrustworthiness concerns under Guideline F, financial considerations and Guideline E, \npersonal conduct. DOD CAF acted under DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial \nPersonnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended \n(Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated in Security Executive Agent \nDirective 4, National Security Adjudicative Guidelines (December 10, 2016), for all \nadjudicative decisions on or after June 8, 2017. \nApplicant answered the SOR on October 22, 2019, and requested a hearing before \nan administrative judge (Answer).

(GE 2 at 4; Tr. 20, 28, 37-40, 63-64) \nIn June 13, 2018, Applicant\u2019s work hours were reduced because of a lack of work, \nand his position was eventually terminated. He received unemployment benefits, but his \nchild support payments were automatically deducted from his checks, which left him with \nvery little to pay his bills. In January 2019, a judgment was entered against Applicant for \nthe almost $20,000 student loan debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.a. Since May 2019, his wages \nhave been garnished $400 monthly. He provided documentation to reflect that as of June \n2021, the balance of the account alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.a was $9,611.43. (See Chart; Tr. \n28-35) \nIn his Answer to the SOR, Applicant indicated he was working with a debt \nconsolidator to resolve many of the debts alleged in the SOR. However, he admitted at \nthe hearing that he never made payments to the debt consolidation company, nor has he \nmade payments toward the underlying debts. (See Chart; Tr. 36, 57) \nApplicant did not disclose any tax issues in his 2016 SCA. During his October 2018 \ninterview with a Government investigator (adopted in July 2019), Applicant disclosed that \nhe was audited in 2017 for either his 2014 or 2015 state and federal income tax returns, \nand both the state and the IRS were garnishing his paychecks $75. In his Answer to the \nSOR, he claimed he was making payments to both his state\u2019s department of revenue and \nthe IRS. He averred he established payment agreements with the IRS in October 2019 \nand with his state in November 2019. He did not provide supporting documentation to \ncorroborate his claims.

He did this because he needed the \nmoney he anticipated he would receive from his returns to pay his bills. He knew that he \nowed money to the IRS and his state, but he manipulated the information in his tax filings \nto reduce his income and to maximize his refunds. Applicant claimed that he timely filed \nboth his TY 2014 and 2015 state and federal income tax returns. He also claimed that he \nestablished a payment agreement with the IRS in January 21, 2020, that he has been \npaying $150 per paycheck and that he owed no back taxes to the IRS for TY 2014 and \n2015. He provided no documentation to support his claims. (Tr. 36, 48-52) \nIn his post-hearing submissions, Applicant provided copies of pay stubs from \nCompany B. These stubs reflect garnishments, in various and inconsistent amounts, \nbetween July 2019 and June 2021. The garnishments did not occur every month, and the \nstubs do not reflect the creditors that were garnishing his wages. One of the documents \nprovided by Applicant clearly shows that some of the garnishments reflected in the pay \nstubs were for the debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.i, and the outstanding balance on July 13, \n2021 was $543.67. (See Chart; AE C; AE I-K; Tr. 36-44) \nApplicant testified that his paychecks were garnished to pay his outstanding state \ntaxes and the $240 debt alleged SOR \u00b6 1.l. This debt was related to some of the fines \nand related criminal activity alleged in the SOR. According to Applicant, he believes the \ndocumentation that he provided after the hearing demonstrates that he has no \noutstanding financial obligations to his state; and that this debt should be resolved in his \nfavor. I disagree. It is unclear from the documentation that the debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.l \nhas been paid and resolved. This documentation does demonstrate that in the past, \nApplicant was behind on his child support payments, and his state tax refund from 2016 \nwas seized and applied to this obligation. Applicant\u2019s 2014 state income taxes were filed \nand resolved in a timely manner, and his refund was applied to a debt owed to another \nundisclosed state agency. His 2015 state income tax return was filed and paid in full as \nof June 4, 2019. It was not filed and paid in a timely manner, but it is resolved. (AE C, AE \nE-H; Tr. 44-48) \nIn his post-hearing submissions, Applicant claimed he submitted documentation \nregarding his federal income taxes. However, the documentation that he provided is for \nhis state income taxes. Additionally, he labeled documents as \u201cIRS Documents 1\u201d and \n\u201cIRS Documents 2,\u201d which I marked as AE E and AE F, respectively. These documents \nare duplicates of each other. (AE C; AE E-H) \nApplicant has been using Quicken software to monitor his finances. He testified \nthat he is current on all of his bills, and his federal student loans are deferred due to the \nCoronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act. Applicant filed for Chapter \n7 bankruptcy protection in 2010, and his debts totaling $70,000 to $80,000 were \ndischarged in 2012. His financial issues were the result of medical debt, credit cards, and \npayday loans \u2013 living outside of his financial means. His bankruptcy and several other \nincidents in the personal conduct section, infra, are not alleged in the SOR, and they will \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \nnot be considered as disqualifying conduct.

While he was in the Navy, he struggled with following \nrules and had issues with authority. Additionally, his father\u2019s stroke from a year earlier \nweighed heavily on him. Due to these issues, Applicant did not handle the stress and \ndemands of the military and chose to leave the Navy without authorization in August 1996. \nHe was apprehended in September 1997, charged with unauthorized absence (UA), and \nadministratively discharged from the Navy with an Other than Honorable (OTH) discharge \nin October 1997, as alleged in SOR \u00b6 2.a. There is no evidence he was tried by court-\nmartial for being absent without leave. (See Chart; Tr. at 66-70) \nIn 1998 or 1999, Applicant was arrested for fraudulently using and charging $1,000 \nto $1,200 to his son\u2019s mother\u2019s credit card. This incident was not alleged in the SOR and \nwill not be considered as disqualifying conduct. However, he testified that he never paid \nthe associated fine for this incident, and there was an outstanding warrant for his arrest, \nwhich resulted in the arrest alleged in SOR \u00b6 2.g, for failure to pay. (Tr. 94-95) \nBetween February 2003 and December 2004, Applicant was arrested multiple \ntimes for incidents related to domestic abuse, as alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.d and 2.e. These \nincidents involved the mother of his daughter. According to Applicant they have a good \nrelationship at this time. The December 2004 domestic abuse incident was not alleged in \nthe SOR and will not be considered as disqualifying conduct. (Tr. at 72, 85-90) \nApplicant was arrested three times for filling his car up with gasoline at gas stations \nand driving away without paying. These arrests occurred in two states between \napproximately 2005 and 2006. He admitted at the hearing that he engaged in this criminal \nbehavior a total of seven or eight times, but was only caught the three times he was \narrested. Only one of these incidents was alleged in SOR \u00b6 2.i, the remaining two arrests \nand the other incidents will not be considered as disqualifying conduct. (Tr. at 96-97) \nBetween 2007 and 2013, Applicant sporadically saw counselors as a result of his \nthen partner demanding that he seek help and modify his behavior if he was going to \nremain in their relationship. As a result, he had fewer issues with law enforcement during \nthis period. They broke up in the summer of 2013 or 2014. (Tr. 75-77) \nIn 2014, Applicant started dating Jane Doe. She was abused as a child and in \nprevious relationships.

In July 2016, when he returned to \nremove his belongings from their home, they argued, and they both called the police. As \na result of this incident, a four-year restraining order was issued against Applicant. At the \nhearing, he claimed he unknowingly violated the restraining order by returning to their \napartment complex to check on a vehicle that he left there. (Tr. 77-84) \nFollowing the 2016 arrest alleged in SOR \u00b6 2.j for violation of a restraining order, \nApplicant was court-ordered to attend over 50 weekly counseling sessions. He was tested \nand subsequently diagnosed with Asperger\u2019s syndrome. Applicant\u2019s counseling has \nhelped him understand his anger issues. Since he completed the mandatory program in \napproximately September 2018, Applicant has attended 20 voluntary sessions. As of the \ndate of the hearing, he most recently attended counseling in May 2021. He currently \nmeditates daily to help himself mentally and talks to a good friend. The restraining order \nexpired in November 2020. (Tr. 71-76, 83-85, 104-106) \nThe SOR alleges that Applicant was arrested or ticketed ten times for operating a \nvehicle while his license was revoked or suspended between August 2000 and March \n2017. The documentary evidence indicates Applicant was actually arrested \napproximately seventeen times between August 2000 and June 2019. At the hearing, \nApplicant admitted that the last time he was arrested or ticked for driving under a \nsuspended or revoked license or with no insurance was in 2020. Additionally, there were \nperiods in 2020 that he operated a vehicle without a valid driver\u2019s license and without car \ninsurance. He lost his driver\u2019s license due to receiving too many speeding tickets. (See \nChart; Tr. 98-100) \nApplicant testified that his numerous tickets for operating without a valid driver\u2019s \nlicense were the result of him being the sole wage earner in his family, and his need to \nget to work. At his hearing, Applicant claimed that he had had paid all of the state fees \nassociated with his various tickets and crimes, his driver\u2019s license was in good standing, \nand his vehicle was fully insured. (Tr. 19-20, 98) \nIn his 2016 SCA, Applicant did not disclose any marijuana use during the previous \nseven years. In his October 2018 interview with the Government investigator, he admitted \nto using marijuana in 2012 or 2014. At the hearing, he testified that his \u201cfirm belief is \nmarijuana is not necessarily a drug and should be taken off the Schedule I with the DEA \nso [he does not] think of that as a drug per se.\u201d When questioned, he admitted to using it \nin 2017 or 2018, after he completed his SCA, but before his interview with the investigator. \nApplicant\u2019s failure to disclose his drug use in his SCA and during his interview were not \nalleged in the SOR. Additionally, his drug use was not alleged in the SOR. His failure to \ndisclose his marijuana use on his SCA and during his interview will not be considered as \ndisqualifying conduct. (GE 1 at 28-29; GE 2 at 10-11; Tr. at 80; 102-104) \nThe documentary evidence indicates Applicant had outstanding warrants almost \ncontinuously between 1999 and 2009. These warrants were often related to his criminal \nconduct alleged in the SOR. However, his failure to resolve his court issues related to his \ntraffic tickets for operating a vehicle without a valid or suspended license also led to \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nmultiple warrants.

(GE 6; GE 9) \nApplicant loves his current job and wants to continue working there. He has had \nno reprimands other than attendance issues when he first starting working there due to \ncourt-related obligations. He believes he is highly regarded at his position by his \nsupervisor. (Tr.at 118-119) \nPolicies \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG), which became \neffective on June 8, 2017. \nPositions designated as ADP I/II/III are classified as \u201csensitive positions.\u201d (See \nRegulation \u00b6\u00b6 C3.1.2.1.1.7 and C3.1.2.1.2.3.) \u201cThe standard that must be met for . . . \nassignment to sensitive duties is that, based on all available information, the person\u2019s \nloyalty, reliability, and trustworthiness are such that . . . assigning the person to sensitive \nduties is clearly consistent with the interests of national security.\u201d (See Regulation \u00b6 \nC6.1.1.1.) The Deputy Under Secretary of Defense (Counterintelligence and Security) \nMemorandum, dated November 19, 2004, indicates trustworthiness adjudications will \napply to cases forwarded to DOHA by the Defense Security Service and Office of \nPersonnel Management. Department of Defense contractor personnel are afforded the \nright to the procedures contained in the Directive before any final unfavorable access \ndetermination may be made. (See Regulation \u00b6 C8.2.1.) \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a public trust position, the \nadministrative judge must consider the disqualifying and mitigating conditions in the \nAdministrative Guidelines (AG) \u00b6 2 (a). These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. \nInstead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known \nas the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to [sensitive] \ninformation will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere \nspeculation or conjecture. \n10\n\n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The Applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable trustworthiness \ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to sensitive information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nsensitive information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard sensitive \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as \nto potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of sensitive information. \nAnalysis \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nThe concern under Guideline F (Financial considerations) is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds . . . .  \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified or sensitive information to raise money. It encompasses concerns \nabout a person\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting \nclassified or sensitive information. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be \nirresponsible, unconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified or \nsensitive information. \nThe record evidence of Applicant\u2019s delinquent debts establishes the following \ndisqualifying condition under AG \u00b6 19: \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nAG \u00b6 20 describes conditions that could mitigate security concerns. The following \n11\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nare potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control;  \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts;  \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue; and \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority \nto file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \nApplicant\u2019s financial issues are the result of periods of unemployment, \nunderemployment, not having health insurance, relationship problems, mental-health \nissues, and the COVID-19 pandemic. However, he has not initiated sufficient actions to \nresolve his existing delinquent debts. Many of the conditions that contributed to \nApplicant\u2019s financial problems were beyond his control, but he has not demonstrated that \nhe acted responsibly to address his delinquent debts. Additionally, it is clear from the \ntotality of the evidence that many of Applicant\u2019s financial issues were related to his \nunderlying behavioral problems. His court costs, tickets, fines, and fees were and have \nbeen significant over the years. He did not establish his inability to change and modify his \nbehavior. \nApplicant has worked for his current employer for over three years, but he has \nfailed to voluntarily address many of the debts alleged in the SOR. Although he has no \nnew delinquent consumer debts, Applicant\u2019s financial issues continue to be an ongoing \nconcern. The documentation that he provided demonstrates that the debts that are being \nresolved are only being paid because his creditors sought judgments and are actively \n12\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ngarnishing his paychecks. Therefore, he does not receive complete credit for mitigation \nunder AG \u00b6 20(d). \nApplicant\u2019s history of financial problems extends back to at least 2010, when he \nfiled for Chapter 7 bankruptcy, and debts totaling $70,000 to $80,000 were discharged. \nAlthough he had counseling as part of the bankruptcy process, he accrued new debts \nafter his bankruptcy. Finally, he did not provide documentation demonstrating that he has \nfiled and paid his 2014 and 2015 federal income taxes. Mitigation under AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a), \n20(b), 20(c), 20(d), 20(e), and 20(g) was not established.  \nGuideline E: Personal Conduct \nThe concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 15: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. The following will normally result in \nan unfavorable national security eligibility determination, security clearance \naction, or cancellation of further processing for national security eligibility: \n(a) refusal, or failure without reasonable cause, to undergo or \ncooperate with security processing, including but not limited \nto meeting with a security investigator for subject interview, \ncompleting security forms or releases, cooperation with \nmedical \nor \npsychological \nevaluation, \nor \npolygraph \nexamination, if authorized and required; and \n(b) refusal to provide full, frank, and truthful answers to lawful \nquestions of investigators, security officials, or other official \nrepresentatives in connection with a personnel security or \ntrustworthiness determination. \nFor almost 20 years, Applicant engaged in conduct that was, at times, criminal in \nnature, and demonstrated questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, and an \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations. Based upon Applicant\u2019s behavior \nbetween 1997 and 2017, the following disqualifying condition (DC) under this AG \u00b6 16 is \napplicable: \n(e) personal conduct, or concealment of information about one's conduct, \nthat creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress by a \nforeign intelligence entity or other individual or group. Such conduct \nincludes: (1) engaging in activities which, if known, could affect the person's \npersonal, professional, or community standing. \n13\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nMany of the alleged incidents were traffic-related and may not be crimes, others \nare likely misdemeanors, and a few could be felonies. Having considered all of the factors \nset forth in AG \u00b6 17 that could mitigate the concern under this guideline, I find the following \nrelevant: \nAG \u00b6 17(c): the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the \nbehavior is so infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances \nthat it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's \nreliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; and \nAG \u00b6 17(d): the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained \ncounseling to change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate \nthe stressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, \nunreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to \nrecur. \nSome of Applicant\u2019s incidents were relatively minor traffic violations, but when his \nbehavior is considered as a whole, his criminal and traffic incidents are not insignificant, \nthey establish a pattern of a person who fails to follow rules and regulations. As previously \nstated, numerous arrests and traffic tickets were not alleged in the SOR, and were not \nconsidered in determining if the disqualifying condition applied; however, these incidents \nwere a factor in determining if the mitigating conditions are applicable. \nIn this case, Applicant was arrested or ticketed over 33 times between October \n1997 and 2020. He admitted to stealing gasoline from gas stations an additional four or \nfive times without receiving tickets or being arrested. Additionally, he continued to drive \nhis vehicle without a valid driver\u2019s license and without insurance after the SOR was issued \nin October 2019, and received a ticket as recently as 2020. He was arrested multiple \ntimes for domestic violence and had an active restraining order until as recently as \nNovember 2020, less than two years ago. Given his lengthy history of misconduct, the \nfrequency of Applicant\u2019s arrests and tickets, and the recency of his last ticket, he has not \ndemonstrated that it is unlikely that this type of behavior will recur. \nApplicant also failed to be forthright on his 2016 SCA and during his 2018 interview \nwith a Government investigator regarding his use of marijuana. He admitted at the hearing \nthat he used marijuana after he completed his SCA and before his interview. This \nbehavior, his lack of candor and his drug abuse, was not alleged in the SOR; however, it \ndoes contribute to Applicant\u2019s history of criminal activity and ongoing inability to follow \nrules and regulations and behave in a responsible and trustworthy manner. \nApplicant attended counseling sporadically between 2007 and 2013; consistently \nbetween 2007 and 2008; and approximately 20 times between 2008 and May 2021. He \nis to be commended for voluntarily attending counseling after his court-ordered treatment \nwas satisfied in 2008; however, he failed to demonstrate that the underlying behavior or \npersonal conduct is unlikely to recur. \n14\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \nI have doubts about Applicant\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, judgment, and his \nwillingness or ability to comply with rules and regulations. Thus, I cannot conclude that \nhe has mitigated the Guideline E concerns. AG \u00b6\u00b6 17(c) and 17(d) do not apply. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a public trust position by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \npublic trust position must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the potentially \ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and circumstances \nsurrounding this case. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions or doubts as to Applicant\u2019s \neligibility and suitability for a public trust position. His twenty plus years of engaging in \ncriminal and irresponsible behavior, his use of illegal drugs, his failure to be forthright \nregarding his drug use, and his failure to resolve his financial obligations without \ngarnishments, cause me to question his eligibility and suitability for a position of trust. For \nall these reasons, I conclude Applicant did not mitigate the trustworthiness concerns \narising from his delinquent debts and personal conduct. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F (Financial Considerations): AGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.b \u2013 1.h: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.i: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.j \u2013 1.p: \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.q: \nFor Applicant \n15\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n___________________________ \nParagraph 2, Guideline E (Personal Conduct):   \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 2.a \u2013 2.k: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a \npublic trust position.

His admissions are \nincorporated into these findings of fact. After a review of the pleadings and evidence, I \nmake the following additional findings of fact. \nApplicant is a 69-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He began working \nat his present job in July 2004. He also has owned a home-based business since 1999 \n(Bus. A). He retired from the U.S. Air Force as a lieutenant colonel in 1995. He served \nfrom 1974 to 1995 as a missile officer. He holds a master\u2019s degree. He has been \nmarried for 47 years and has two adult children. (Tr. 19-21, 32, 34, 41; GE 1) \nApplicant first received a security clearance when he was commissioned in the \nAir Force in 1974. He has since held a clearance for over forty years without incident. \nAccording to his current supervisor, Applicant handles classified information on a daily \nbasis in a secured facility and has never had a security incident or violation. (Tr. 20, 32, \n47; GE 1) \nThe SOR alleged Applicant failed to timely file his federal income tax returns for \nyears 2012-2014 and 2016. It also alleged that he failed to file his state income tax \nreturns for years 2012-2016. (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a \u2013 1.b). The basis for the allegations came to \nlight when Applicant voluntarily admitted not filing his tax returns when he completed his \nAugust 2017 security clearance application (SCA). Those admissions establish the \nallegations by substantial evidence. (GE 1) \nApplicant credibly explained that he failed to file his federal and state tax returns \nfor the stated years initially because he had not kept good records for Bus. A and that \ncaused him to delay filing his tax returns. This occurred starting with tax year 2012. He \nwas never able to get the records together to file his 2012 returns and this then \nimpacted the succeeding years. Everything snowballed on him after that. He stated in \nhis 2017 SCA that he would complete and file the delinquent tax returns by September \n2017. He acknowledged that he failed to meet that self-imposed deadline. During his \nSeptember 2018 background interview, he told that investigator that he anticipated \nresolving all his tax issues by December 2018.

He has also received advice from a certified \npublic accountant (CPA) concerning his tax issues.

In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(a), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk that an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nAG & 18 expresses the security concern for financial considerations: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. I have \nconsidered all of them under AG & 19 and the following potentially apply: \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired. \nThe evidence showed Applicant failed to timely file his federal tax returns for \n2012-2014 and 2016, and his state tax returns for 2012-2016. I find the above \ndisqualifying conditions are raised. \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns \narising from financial difficulties. I have considered all of the mitigating conditions under \nAG \u00b6 20 and the following potentially apply: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control; and \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n       \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax \nauthority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \nThere is no doubt that Applicant should have responded in a timelier fashion to \nhis tax problems. However, he has now resolved his federal and state tax-filing issues. \nWhile he waited until 2019 to file his delinquent federal returns, he began resolving his \nstate returns in 2017, all before the issuance of the SOR. There are clear indications \nthat his financial issues are resolved and that recurrence is unlikely because he now \nhas a firm handle on his self-employment business records, which were the initial cause \nof his delayed tax return filings. He documented timely filing his 2021 federal and state \ntax returns. He sought professional tax assistance from a CPA and intends to use a \nprofessional tax preparer in the future. AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a), 20(c), and 20(g) are all applicable. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guideline and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nrelevant facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 \n2(d) were addressed under that guideline, but some warrant additional comment. \nI considered Applicant\u2019s military service, his over 40 years of holding a security \nclearance without a security incident, while handling classified information on a daily \nbasis, the recommendations from his coworkers and supervisor, and the circumstances \nsurrounding his delay in filing his tax returns. I also considered that Applicant brought \nhis tax issues up in his 2017 SCA and that he acknowledged making a mistake in not \naddressing his taxes quicker than he did. I\u2019m convinced he will act in a timely manner \nwith his taxes from now on, and that he will not incur tax problems in the future. \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance.

DOHA received the hearing transcript on June 9, 2022. \nRequest for Administrative Notice \nDepartment Counsel requested that I take administrative notice of certain facts about \nthe Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan (Jordan). (HE 1) The facts administratively noticed are \nsummarized in the Findings of Fact and are sourced from public U.S. Government resources \nand a summary by Department Counsel. (HE 1) \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant is a 64-year-old prospective employee of a defense contractor, applying for \na position as a linguist interpreter/translator. He is currently unemployed. He was born in \nNablus, Jordan (now a city in the West Bank, Palestinian territory), studied in Egypt from \n1975 to 1977, graduated from high school, and entered the United States in 1979 on a \nstudent visa. In 1983, he studied toward a certificate in airframe power-plant mechanics and \nhe completed some college coursework, but did not graduate. Applicant married in 1980 (Tr. \n12) and divorced in 1985. He naturalized as a U.S. citizen in 1985. He remarried in 1990 \nand has four adult children, all of whom are U.S. citizens. He has never held a security \nclearance, however he testified that he previously held a public trust position. (Tr. 61) \nThe SOR alleges Applicant\u2019s spouse is a citizen and resident of Jordan (SOR \u00b6 1.a); \nhis three sons and daughter are residents of Jordan (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b and 1.c); and his two \nsisters, two brothers and mother-in-law are citizens and residents of Jordan (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d-\n1.f). The SOR also alleges Applicant maintains close and continuing contact with various \nrelatives residing in Jordan (SOR \u00b6 1.g), and a friend who is a citizen and resident of Qatar, \nis employed as a minister delegate with the Qatari Ministry of Foreign Affairs. (SOR \u00b6 1.h) \nIn his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted that his spouse, sisters, and mother-in-law are \ncitizens and residents of Jordan, but denied the remaining allegations with explanations.  \nAfter attaining U.S. citizenship in 1985, he returned to Jordan in 1986 and opened a \nrestaurant that he operated from 1987 to 1990, until he sold it to his brother. (Tr. 13) From \n1991 to 2000, Applicant worked for the Saudi Arabian embassy in Germany as a translator, \npassport document filer (GE 3) and occasional medical patient transporter (Tr. 14). Of note, \nhe stated in his personal subject interview (PSI) with a Government investigator conducted \nin December 2017 and January 2018, that he moved to Jordan in 1986 or 1987 after his \ndivorce from his first spouse, and re-established contact with his current spouse, whom he \nknew from childhood and married in 1990. Despite his contrary testimony, he stated that he \nmoved to Germany in 1992, and worked as a hotel cook and eventually as a \u201chospital \ntranslator\u201d until he left Germany in 2000. (GE 2) He said in his November 2017 \nCounterintelligence Screening Questionnaire (counterintelligence screening) that he was \nnot an official contract employee of the embassy, but was paid in cash. (GE 3 at p.7) When \npressed in his PSI about who paid him, he stated that he was contracted by the Saudi \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n   \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nembassy as a translator, but not employed by them directly. He was paid by \u201cclients\u201d whom \nhe transported between the airport, hospital, and their hotels. He said he left Germany in \n2000 and \u201cdid not maintain any contact with the Saudi embassy or his \u201cclients\u201d after he left. \n(GE 2 at p.39) Contrary to Applicant\u2019s statement in his PSI, he did in fact maintain at least \none relationship with a \u201cclient\u201d he met in Germany.  \nWhile working for the Saudi embassy, Applicant met Sheikh K, a Qatari citizen, who \nhad a relationship with Saudi Arabia and was in Germany for medical care. (Tr. 48, 52) \nSheikh K employed Applicant for about six months while in Germany. Sheikh K is a member \nof the Qatari royal family. According to Applicant, Sheikh K was appointed as a Minister \nDelegate to the Qatari Ministry of Foreign Affairs. (GE 2 at p. 20; Tr. 49) The record does \nnot indicate the Sheikh\u2019s current status. \nApplicant returned to the U.S. in 2000 and worked at a restaurant. From 2006 to 2011, \nApplicant lived and worked in Iraq as a U.S. military contract translator/linguist for Multi-\nNational Forces-Iraq, including at Iraq\u2019s largest theater internment facility and for U.S. \nspecial operations forces in Iraq. (GE 3, AE A) In 2011, he moved back to Jordan for a few \nmonths. \nAfter Sheikh K returned to Qatar, he asked Applicant to move there and work in a \nUnited Arab Emirates (UAE)-based construction company in Qatar, owned by Sheikh K\u2019s \nbrother, Sultan H, also a member of the Qatari royal family. (Tr. 48-51; GE 2 at pp. 19-20) \nThrough this association, Applicant also met another of the Sultan\u2019s brothers (landlord) in \n2013. (GE 2, p. 27-28) \nAlthough Applicant testified that he lived and worked in Qatar from 2011 until 2013, \nhe stated in his PSI that he lived in Qatar from 2013 to 2017, and in his counterintelligence \nscreening, he listed that he lived in Qatar from 2014 to 2016, and was employed by two \ncompanies in Qatar from October 2013 to June 2017. (Tr. 20-21; GE 2; and GE 3) \nWhile in Qatar, Applicant worked as a general supervisor for a construction company \nbased out of the UAE and related to Sultan H, Sheikh K\u2019s brother, whom he met in Germany. \n(Tr. 21; GE 3 at p. 2) In about 2016, he then changed employment to another company in \nQatar for better pay, owned by Mr. F, a Qatari citizen and good friend of Sultan H. (GE 1; \nGE 1 at pp. 21-23; GE 2 at p. 14) In his PSI, Applicant stated that Mr. F is a member of a \nQatari law firm and owner of a construction company where Applicant was a general \nsupervisor. (GE 1; GE 2 at p. 28; GE 3 at p. 3) Applicant described his construction company \npositions in various ways throughout the investigation to include advisor, advisor consultant, \npublic relations, general supervisor, and general management. (GEs 1 \u2013 3; Tr. 20, 51) \nApplicant stated in his PSI that he maintained quarterly contact with Sheikh K from \n1998 to 2016, however, in testimony, he said he has not had contact with him in the past 10 \nyears. In his Answer to the SOR, he said that they were never close friends and has not had \ncontact with him since 2010. (Ans.; Tr. 56) He testified that he had no relationship with \nSheikh K, and spoke to him only about a job opportunity. He said \u201cI wasn\u2019t really infatuated \nto talk to this guy.\u201d He said he stopped talking to Sheikh K after a ten-year relationship \u201cmost \nof the time, yes.\u201d (Tr. 56) In his PSI, Applicant stated that his last contact with Sheikh K was \nApril 2016, however, according to his November 2017 counterintelligence screening, he \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \nmaintained \u201cmonthly\u201d contact with Sheikh K.

(GE 3) \nApplicant also stated that his friend, Sheikh K, applied for his visa in 2014 to travel \nwith the Sheikh to Saudi Arabia for vacation, at Sheikh K\u2019s expense. (GE 3 at p.8) He did \nnot discuss this employment or vacation in testimony. In Applicant\u2019s PSI, he detailed his \nforeign travel, including: \n- \nJune 2011, traveled to Qatar to visit his friend Sheikh K. \n- \nJune 2011, traveled to Thailand for a 26-day vacation with Sheikh K, who paid for all \nof their expenses. \n- \nSeptember to October 2011, traveled to Qatar to \u201csee business or job opportunities \nthere.\u201d \n- \nSeptember 2012, traveled to UAE to \u201cprobably\u201d look for work opportunities as a \nlinguist. \n- \nFebruary 2014 to May 2014, traveled to Saudi Arabia with Sheikh K and Sultan H for \nvacation. Applicant\u2019s expenses were paid by Sheikh K and Sultan H. \n- \nDecember 2014, January 2015, and March 2015, \n \n \ntraveled to the UAE for Sultan H\u2019s \ncompany. \n- \nJuly 2015, traveled with Sultan H, the Sultan\u2019s brother Mr. S, and others, to France. \nThey began in Nice, and took an eight-day cruise. Mr. S is married to a relative of the \nPrince of Qatar. \n- \nOctober 2015, traveled to the United Kingdom (UK) to \u201ctake care of personal stuff for \nSultan H\u201d pertaining to the Sultan\u2019s investment property. \n- \nDecember 2015, traveled to the UK to \u201cdo personal errands for Sultan H,\u201d including \nto pick up the Sultan\u2019s purchases. \n- \nFebruary 2017, traveled to the UK to do personal errands for Mr. F, including to fix a \nbank account issue for Mr. F. \nExcept for disclosing the 2014 vacation with Sheikh K to Saudi Arabia (but not disclosing \nSultan H\u2019s participation), the remaining trips were not discussed in Applicant\u2019s \ncounterintelligence screening. \nWhile living in Jordan from 2013 to 2017, he was not employed, but lived off of his \nsavings. (Tr. 19-23) Applicant\u2019s spouse, a Jordanian citizen, lives in Jordan where she owns \nan apartment. She is also unemployed. His father is deceased. One of their sons lives with \nher and attends nursing school. Applicant testified that his spouse is awaiting a U.S. \npermanent resident (green) card that she applied for in February or March 2022. Applicant \nis sponsoring her. His spouse visited the U.S. for ten days in 2007, but had to return to \nJordan for an emergency, which led to her loss of a green card. (Ans.)

(Tr. p. 40) \nFrom about 2017 to 2021, Applicant worked as a contract linguist for the U.S. military \nin Kuwait for a few months, and then in Jordan as part of the Jordan Operational \nEngagement Program (JOEP), a joint U.S./Jordan military training program. Since 2021, he \nhas lived in the U.S. He currently lives with his daughter and receives unemployment \nbenefits. Applicant relinquished his Jordanian passport in 2018, and has not renewed it. He \ntravels on his U.S. passport or military issued identification. \nApplicant has an adult daughter and three adult sons. They are all U.S. citizens based \non his U.S. citizenship. His daughter and two sons now live in the U.S., and his third son \nlives in Jordan, attending nursing school. His daughter and three sons were living in Jordan \n(but one son was in school in Germany) when he completed his SCA and PSI in 2017. As \nof at about 2021, his daughter and two sons are now residing in the United States. (Ans.) \nApplicant has five brothers. Two brothers (A and D) live in Germany, one of which is \na dual Jordanian/German citizen while the other is a Jordanian citizen. (Tr. 30-32, SCA, GE \n2) A third brother lives in Jordan (M). He was not mentioned in testimony, but confirmed in \nApplicant\u2019s SCA and PSI. (GE 2; GE 3; SCA) However, in his SCA, Applicant listed two \nbrothers as residing in Jordan, and one living in Germany. He confirmed the SCA entries in \nhis PSI, and noted that two other brothers are deceased. He testified that he speaks to his \nbrothers intermittently, about annually or longer. (Tr. 30-31) However, in his Answer, he \nstated that he has not spoken to either of his brothers in Germany in over 10 years. (Ans.) \nIt appears from testimony that he does not have a close relationship with his brothers in \nGermany, and one brother is infirm. (Tr. 30-33) \nApplicant\u2019s two sisters are citizens and residents of Jordan. In his Answer, he noted \nthat he speaks to them once or twice a year, and in testimony, he said he last spoke with \nthem in 2020, but also said he speaks to them twice a year. (Tr. 33) His mother-in-law is a \ncitizen and resident of Jordan. In his Answer, he stated he spoke to her three years ago, but \nin his SCA, he stated he has annual in-person or telephone contact with her. In testimony, \nhe downplayed the frequency or last contact he has had with family members in Jordan, and \ndenied any continuing contact with extended relatives living in Jordan. (Tr. 29-35) \nIn a post-hearing submission, Applicant provided numerous positive character letters \nfrom U.S. military officers with whom he worked in Iraq, certificates of appreciation, \nchallenge coins, excellent performance evaluations, letters of recommendation for \nemployment, and training certificates. Applicant does not currently work, does not own a \ncar, property, or investments, and has about $4,000 in a U.S. bank account. I found \nApplicant\u2019s testimony to be at times confusing, evasive, incomplete, less than forthcoming, \nand contrary to documentary evidence in the record. \nJORDAN \nThe Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan (Jordan) is a constitutional monarchy ruled by \nKing Abdullah II bin Hussein.

The Public Security Directorate and the General Intelligence \nDirectorate share responsibility for maintaining internal security. The General Intelligence \nDirectorate reports directly to the King. The armed forces report to the Minister of Defense \nand are responsible for external security, although they also have a support function for \ninternal security. Members of the security forces have reportedly committed abuses. (HE 1, \nItem 1 - U.S. Department of State, Country reports on Human Rights Practices for 2020: \nJordan, March 30, 2021) \nIn 2013 and 2014, the United States provided Jordan $2.25 billion in loan guarantees, \nallowing Jordan access to affordable financing from international capital markets. The U.S.-\nJordan free trade agreement (FTA), the United States\u2019 first FTA with an Arab country, has \nexpanded the trade relationship by reducing barriers for services, providing cutting-edge \nprotection for intellectual property, ensuring regulatory transparency, and requiring effective \nlabor and environmental enforcement. The United States and Jordan have an \u201copen skies\u201d \ncivil aviation agreement; a bilateral investment treaty; a science and technology cooperation \nagreement; and a memorandum of understanding on nuclear energy cooperation. Such \nagreements bolster efforts to help diversify Jordan\u2019s economy and promote growth. Jordan \nand the United States belong to a number of the same international organizations, including \nthe United Nations, International Monetary Fund, World Bank, and World Trade \nOrganization. Jordan also is a Partner for Cooperation with the Organization for Security \nand Cooperation in Europe.  \nThe United States deeply values its long history of cooperation and friendship with \nJordan with which it established diplomatic relations in 1949. The United States and Jordan \nshare the mutual goals of a comprehensive, just, and lasting peace between Israel and the \nPalestinians, and an end to violent extremism that threatens the security of Jordan, the \nregion, and the entire globe. The peace process and Jordan\u2019s opposition to terrorism parallel \nand assist wider U.S. interests. U.S. policy seeks to reinforce Jordan\u2019s commitment to \npeace, stability, and moderation. In light of ongoing regional unrest, as well as global \ndisruptions stemming from the COVID-19 pandemic, the United States has helped Jordan \nmaintain its stability and prosperity through economic and military assistance and through \nclose political cooperation. \nAs of August 8, 2022, the U.S. Department of State travel advisories for Jordan range \nfrom Level 2 (Exercise Increased Caution) due to terrorism, to Level 4 (Do Not Travel), \ndepending on the area of the country visited. The capital of Amman is currently assessed \nas being at considerable risk from terrorism directed at or affecting official U.S. Government \ninterests. The threat of terrorism across Jordan remains high. Transnational and indigenous \nterrorist groups in Jordan have demonstrated the capability to plan and implement attacks. \nViolent extremist groups in Syria and Iraq have conducted attacks in Jordan and continue \nto plot against local security forces, U.S. and Western interests, and soft targets such as \nhigh profile public events, hotels, places of worship, restaurants, schools, and malls. \nJordan\u2019s prominent role in the effort to defeat ISIS, and its shared borders with Iraq and \nSyria, increase the potential for future terrorist incidents.  \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAdditionally, violence in the West Bank and Gaza has led to demonstrations and anti- \nGovernment/anti-U.S. sentiment in Jordan. Regional issues can inflame anti-U.S./anti-\nWestern sentiment. U.S. involvement in Iraq and Syria as well as U.S. Government policies \non Israel have fueled anti-U.S. sentiment. Jordan\u2019s most significant human rights issues \ninclude: cases of cruel, inhumane, and derogatory treatment or punishment; arbitrary arrest \nand detention, including of activists and journalists; infringement on citizens\u2019 privacy rights; \nserious restrictions on free expression and the press, including criminalization of libel, \ncensorship, and internet site blocking; substantial restrictions on freedom of association and \nfreedom of peaceful assembly; serious incidents of official corruption; \u201chonor\u201d killings of \nwomen; trafficking in persons; and violence against lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender \npersons. Impunity remained widespread, although the Jordanian government took some \nlimited steps to investigate, prosecute, and punish officials who committed abuses. \nLaw and Policies \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 \nU.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \u201ccontrol \naccess to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual is \nsufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The President has \nauthorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants eligibility for access \nto classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with the national \ninterest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 2. \nNational security eligibility is predicated upon the applicant meeting the criteria \ncontained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. \nInstead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge applies \nthese guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative \njudge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider a person\u2019s stability, trustworthiness, reliability, discretion, \ncharacter, honesty, and judgment. AG \u00b6 1(b). \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation about \npotential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no \nsense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 7. \nThus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant has not \nmet the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for \nissuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from being \neligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of establishing \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nis \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v.

The guidelines presume a nexus or rational \nconnection between proven conduct under any of the criteria listed therein and an \napplicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 92-1106 at 3, 1993 WL 545051 at *3 \n(App. Bd. Oct. 7, 1993). \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial evidence, \nthe burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts. Directive \n\u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, and the burden of \ndisproving it never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02- 31154 at 5 (App. Bd. \nSep. 22, 2005). \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-\n20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if they \nmust, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 1(d). \nAnalysis \nGuideline B, Foreign Influence \nAG \u00b6 6 explains the security concern about \u201cforeign contacts and interests\u201d stating: \nForeign contacts and interests, including, but not limited to, business, financial, \nand property int\n \nerests, are a national security concern if they result in divided \nallegiance. They may also be a national security concern if they create \ncircumstances in which the individual may be manipulated or induced to help \na foreign person, group, organization, or government in a way inconsistent \nwith U.S. interests or otherwise made vulnerable to pressure or coercion by \nany foreign interest. Assessment of foreign contacts and interests should \nconsider the country in which the foreign contact or interest is located, \nincluding, but not limited to, considerations such as whether it is known to \ntarget U.S. citizens to obtain classified or sensitive information or is associated \nwith a risk of terrorism. \nAG \u00b6 7 has three conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying in this case: \n(a) contact, regardless of method, with a foreign family member, business or \nprofessional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or resident in \na foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of foreign \nexploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; and \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that create \na potential conflict of interest between the individual's obligation to protect \nclassified or sensitive information or technology and the individual's desire to \nhelp a foreign person, group, or country by providing that information or \ntechnology. \n8 \n\n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nGuideline B is not limited to countries hostile to the United States. \u201cThe United States \nhas a compelling interest in protecting and safeguarding classified information from any \nperson, organization, or country that is not authorized to have access to it, regardless of \nwhether that person, organization, or country has interests inimical to those of the United \nStates.\u201d ISCR Case No. 02-11570 at 5 (App. Bd. May 19, 2004). Furthermore, \u201ceven friendly \nnations can have profound disagreements with the United States over matters they view as \nimportant to their vital interests or national security.\u201d ISCR Case No. 00-0317 (App. Bd. Mar. \n29, 2002). Finally, we know friendly nations have engaged in espionage against the United \nStates, especially in the economic, scientific, and technical fields. Nevertheless, the nature \nof a nation\u2019s government, its relationship with the United States, and its human-rights record \nare relevant in assessing the likelihood that an applicant\u2019s family members are vulnerable \nto government coercion. \nThe risk of coercion, persuasion, or duress is significantly greater if the foreign \ncountry has an authoritarian government, a family member is associated with or dependent \nupon the government, or the country is known to conduct intelligence operations against the \nUnited States. In considering the nature of the government, an administrative judge must \nalso consider any terrorist activity in the country at issue. See generally ISCR Case No. 02-\n26130 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 7, 2006) (reversing decision to grant clearance where \nadministrative judge did not consider terrorist activity in area where family members \nresided).   \nAG \u00b6 7(a) requires substantial evidence of a \u201cheightened risk.\u201d The \u201cheightened risk\u201d \nrequired to raise one of these disqualifying conditions is a relatively low standard. \n\u201cHeightened risk\u201d denotes a risk greater than the normal risk inherent in having a family \nmember living under a foreign government. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 12-05839 at 4 (App. \nBd. Jul. 11, 2013). See also ISCR Case No.17-03026 at 5 (App. Bd. Jan. 16, 2019) \n(\u201cHeightened risk\u201d is not a high standard.). Applicant\u2019s family connections and risk of \nterrorism in Jordan are sufficient to establish a \u201cheightened risk.\u201d AG \u00b6\u00b6 7(a) and (b) are \nimplicated by Applicant\u2019s foreign contacts, including his spouse, son, and other family \nmembers in Jordan, and his friend in Qatar. \nAG \u00b6 8 lists conditions that could mitigate foreign influence security concerns, \nincluding: \n(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in which \nthese persons are located, or the positions or activities of those persons in that \ncountry are such that it is unlikely the individual will be placed in a position of \nhaving to choose between the interests of a foreign individual, group, \norganization, or government and the interests of the United States; \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of \nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, or allegiance to the group, \ngovernment, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such deep and \nlongstanding relationships and loyalties in the United States, that the individual \ncan be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the U.S. interest; \nand \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(c) contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and infrequent \nthat there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign influence or \nexploitation. \nApplicant is a U.S. citizen who maintains regular contact with his spouse, son, sisters, \nmother-in-law, and brothers who are citizens of Jordan, and most of whom reside in Jordan. \nOf greatest concern is Applicant\u2019s spouse (a Jordanian citizen) and son (a U.S. citizen) who \nreside in Jordan. The mere possession of close family ties with one or more family members \nliving in Jordan is not, as a matter of law, disqualifying under Guideline B; however, if an \napplicant has a close relationship with even one relative living in a foreign country, this factor \nalone is sufficient to create the potential for foreign influence and could potentially result in \nthe compromise of classified information. See Generally ISCR Case No. 03- 02382 at 5 \n(App. Bd. Feb. 15, 2006); ISCR Case No. 99-0424 (App. Bd. Feb. 8, 2001). There is a \nrebuttable presumption that a person has ties of affection for, or obligation to, their \nimmediate family members. See generally ISCR Case No. 01-03120, 2002 DOHA LEXIS \n94 at *8 (App. Bd. Feb. 20, 2002). \nApplicant maintains reasonably close contact with his family members remaining in \nJordan. Although he claims that he is not friends with Sheikh K and maintains no contact \nwith him, the contradictory evidence in the record and Applicant\u2019s testimony tell a different \nstory. He has vacationed with Sheikh K at no personal expense to himself, and worked for \nhim, including conducting personal business for him in another foreign country. The extent \nof his work and other activities with Sheikh K and related Qatari royal family members and \nacquaintances has not been satisfactorily explained to relieve concerns of potential foreign \ninfluence raised by Applicant\u2019s relationship to Sheikh K. I have considered non-alleged \nconduct or associations only for the purpose of assessing Applicant\u2019s credibility; in \nevaluating Applicant\u2019s evidence of extenuation, mitigation, or changed circumstances; in \nconsidering whether Applicant has demonstrated successful rehabilitation if applicable; and \nin applying the whole-person concept. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 15-07369 at 3 (App. Bd. \nAug. 16, 2017). \nBased on the record, there is insufficient evidence to fully apply any of the mitigating \nconditions. Applicant has close and continuing contact with his family in Jordan, especially \nhis spouse and son. He provides financial support for them, and has a close relationship to \na foreign government official. \nA key factor in the AG \u00b6 8(b) analysis is Applicant\u2019s \u201cdeep and longstanding \nrelationships and loyalties in the United States.\u201d Applicant was born in Jordan but \nnaturalized as a U.S. citizen. His loyal service to the U.S. military in Iraq and Jordan is \ncommendable, and there is no information showing that he is anything but a loyal American \ncitizen. However, he has few financial ties to the United States as he spends most of his \ntime living overseas. His two sons and daughter are currently living in the U.S., but his \nspouse and a son remain in Jordan. \nApplicant\u2019s relationship with the United States must be weighed against the potential \nconflict of interest created by his relationships with family who are citizens and residents of \nJordan and a friend that is a member of the Qatari royal family and government. His family \nare at a heightened risk from terrorist attacks in Jordan, and Applicant\u2019s service to the U.S. \n10 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nmilitary in Iraq and Jordan may enhance the risks to his family created by his association. \nApplicant\u2019s patriotism is not being questioned, rather he has not shown that his ties \nto the U.S. outweigh his familial interests in Jordan. Applicant\u2019s work with U.S. military in \nIraq and Jordan, and his glowing letters of recommendation weigh in his favor. However, \nthese factors are insufficient to overcome the foreign influence security concerns raised \nabove. Those concerns have not been sufficiently mitigated. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances \nsurrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the \nfrequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at \nthe time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which participation is voluntary; (6) \nthe presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral \nchanges; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, \ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or \nrecurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of \nthe guidelines and the whole-person concept. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline B in my whole-person analysis. \nA Guideline \u201cB\u201d decision concerning Jordan must take into consideration the \n \ngeopolitical situation and risks posed for those living there. Terrorist organizations may \nthreaten Jordanian citizens with ties to the government, the interests of the United States, \nU.S. armed forces, and those who cooperate and assist the United States. Applicant\u2019s \nimmediate family in Jordan are subject to governmental and terrorist activity that puts \nApplicant at significant risk of foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or \ncoercion. Applicant\u2019s interests in the United States do not overcome the foreign influence \nconcerns. \nI have carefully applied the law, as set forth in Department of Navy v. Egan, 484 \nU.S. 518 (1988), Exec. Or. 10865, the Directive, and the AGs, to the facts and  \ncircumstances in the context of the whole person. After weighing the disqualifying and \nmitigating conditions and evaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole person, I \nconclude Applicant has not mitigated the foreign influence security concerns raised in the \nSOR and described above.  \nAccordingly, I conclude Applicant has not carried his burden of showing that it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant him eligibility for access to classified \ninformation. \n11 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline B:  \nSubparagraphs 1.a, b, d, e, f, h: \nSubparagraphs 1.c and g:  \nAGAINST A\n PPLICANT \nAgainst Applicant \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security \nclearance.

(GE 1) Motivated to join the military after September 11, he enlisted in the Marine Corps, and served on active duty for four years (2003-2007). He served two tours in combat in Iraq and was discharged honorably. (GE 1; Tr. 54-55) He was unemployed for about nine months in 2007-2008 before taking a job on a security detail in the Middle East for a defense contractor. He spent much of the next three years working for defense contractors. (GE 1; Tr. 52-57) Applicant then spent a year (2011-2012) working in retail. He was then unemployed for several years (2012-2016) while pursuing his bachelor\u2019s degree, which he earned in 2016.

The DOD took \nthe action under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \nIndustry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial \n1 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nPersonnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended \n(Directive); and the National Security Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) effective within the \nDOD on June 8, 2017. \nApplicant received the SOR on or about September 3, 2019, and he subsequently \nsubmitted an unsigned, undated response (Answer) in which he addressed each \nallegation, but did not indicate whether or not he wanted a hearing before an \nadministrative judge from the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA). DOHA \nprocessed the case as a hearing and the case was assigned to me on March 2, 2022. \nApplicant subsequently retained counsel. On June 13, 2022, DOHA issued a notice \nscheduling the hearing to occur by video teleconference through an online platform on \nJuly 7, 2022. \nThe hearing convened as scheduled. Applicant confirmed that he had requested \na hearing. (Tr. 4) Department Counsel submitted Government\u2019s Exhibits (GE) 1-4 and \nApplicant\u2019s counsel submitted Applicant\u2019s Exhibits (AE) 1-5, all of which were admitted \nwithout objection. Applicant and three other witnesses testified. \nI left the record open until July 22, 2022, to allow Applicant the opportunity to \nsubmit additional information and for Department Counsel to confirm a jurisdictional \nmatter, addressed below. Applicant subsequently requested and received additional time \nto respond, without objection. Applicant did not submit additional documentation for \nconsideration by the time the record closed on August 24, 2022. DOHA received the \nhearing transcript (Tr.) on July 25, 2022. \nApplicant\u2019s Sponsorship, Jurisdiction, and Clearance Status \nDuring Applicant\u2019s hearing, questions arose as to Applicant\u2019s sponsorship, \nDOHA\u2019s jurisdiction over his case, and the effect of clearance eligibility granted by another \ngovernment department (AGD), as referenced in AE 5. (Tr. 138-143) \nApplicant indicated during his hearing, and Department Counsel subsequently \nconfirmed, that he has been sponsored by contractor D since August 2021. (Tr. 7-9; HE \nIII) Department Counsel also noted that the clearance process of the AGD \u201cdoes not flow \nthrough DOD. They conduct their own background investigations.\u201d (HE XX) Thus, its view \nwas that DOHA has jurisdiction to adjudicate Applicant\u2019s eligibility here. (See also \ncomments of Applicant\u2019s counsel (Tr. 22-23)) Indeed, the AGD referenced in AE 5 is not \none of the U.S. Government departments or Federal agencies with whom DOD has a \nmutual agreement under which DOD Directive 5220.6 applies. (See Directive 5220.6 at \npp. 1-2) Accordingly, the determination of Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a clearance by the AGD \nhas no bearing on DOHA\u2019s jurisdiction over this case, nor is adjudication of Applicant\u2019s \neligibility barred under principles of reciprocity.  \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe level of access for which Applicant is sponsored (Sensitive or Classified) \nThe SOR was issued after Applicant submitted his September 2017 e-QIP, which \nwas based upon his employment with defense contractor C. who was sponsoring him for \naccess to classified information. Applicant now works for defense contractor D, and the \nparties both represented during the hearing that he was now sponsored for a position of \npublic trust, and access to sensitive information, not classified information. (Tr. 7-9) \nAccordingly, the caption of the Statement of Reasons and the prefix to the case \nnumber are amended to reflect that this case now concerns Applicant\u2019s eligibility for \naccess to sensitive information. Thus, Applicant is an \u201cApplicant for Public Trust Position\u201d \nand this is an \u201cADP\u201d case, not an \u201cISCR\u201d case, as noted in the caption, above. (Tr. 7-9) \n\u201cSecurity concerns\u201d in this case are addressed instead as \u201ctrustworthiness concerns.\u201d The \nsame adjudication guidelines apply. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant admitted SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.j with explanations. I construe his \nanswers to SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.a and 2.b as denials of intent to falsify his e-QIP. His admissions \nare incorporated into the findings of fact. After a thorough and careful review of the \npleadings and exhibits submitted, I make the following findings of fact. \nApplicant is 40 years old. He graduated from high school in 2000. (GE 1) Motivated \nto join the military after September 11, he enlisted in the Marine Corps, and served on \nactive duty for four years (2003-2007). He served two tours in combat in Iraq and was \ndischarged honorably. (GE 1; Tr. 54-55) He was unemployed for about nine months in \n2007-2008 before taking a job on a security detail in the Middle East for a defense \ncontractor. He spent much of the next three years working for defense contractors. (GE \n1; Tr. 52-57) \nApplicant then spent a year (2011-2012) working in retail. He was then \nunemployed for several years (2012-2016) while pursuing his bachelor\u2019s degree, which \nhe earned in 2016. (GE 1, GE 2) He indicated in his background interview that he \nsupported himself with his pension and that the post-9/11 GI Bill paid for his education. \n(GE 2 at 4) \nApplicant worked for an insurance company for a few months in 2017 but was \nterminated after a physical altercation with a customer. (GE 1, GE 2) He was then briefly \nunemployed again until September 2017, when he began working for defense contractor \nC, his clearance sponsor. (Tr. 66-67; GE 14) He was released in April 2020, shortly after \nthe beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, because he did not have a clearance. (Tr. 67, \n132) He was then unemployed for about a year. (Tr. 67, 125, 133)  \nApplicant began working for his current employer in April 2021. (Tr. 133-134) As \nnoted, he is now sponsored for a public trust position. He has an annual salary of \n$100,000. (Tr. 113-115) His wife works for a testing laboratory. She has a $63,000 annual \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nsalary. (Tr. 116-117, 120) Applicant estimated that they have a combined a net monthly \nincome of $4,000. (Tr. 88-89) \nAE 5 is a May 2022 e-mail from an agency of the AGD, confirming Applicant\u2019s \n\u201cfavorable adjudication\u201d of his \u201celigibility for continued performance on the [AGD agency] \ncontract.\u201d It also says \u201cthis notification does not constitute a security clearance.\u201d (AE 5) \nApplicant testified that he is working on this contract with his current employer. \nApplicant also testified that he is a disabled veteran. He said he earns 90% \ndisability benefits, at $2,300 per month. (Tr. 88, 119) He testified that his disability related \nto a variety of circumstances and conditions, including PTSD, insomnia, tinnitus, and a \ncombat incident involving blast wounds and shrapnel. (Tr. 119-120) He said he has not \nparticipated in mental health counseling, other than when the Department of Veterans \nAffairs (VA) evaluated his injuries. He did have emergency room (ER) visits (as noted by \nsome of his medical debts). (Tr. 130-131) Applicant did not provide supporting \ndocumentation of his disability status with the VA. \nApplicant married his second wife in 2019. They have three children together, \nincluding a newborn infant born shortly before the hearing. Applicant and his first wife \nmarried in July 2005, and separated in June 2007. He said they divorced in 2017. (Tr. 98-\n99) The marriage produced a daughter (D1), born in 2006, now age 15. D1 lives with her \nmother in State A. Applicant also has a 10-year-old son (S1), born in 2011 through \nanother relationship. S1 lives with his mother in State B. (Tr. 76-79)  \nThe SOR debts concern past-due child support of over $120,000, as well as \nmultiple medical debts, a federal student loan, and some phone debts. The debts are \nlisted on credit reports from October 2017 and April 2019. (GE 3, GE 4) \nApplicant attributed his debts to his employment instability, depression, and PTSD \nafter he returned from Iraq and the Middle East. He said his life began to turn around \nwhen he moved to a new state, met his second wife, and returned to work as a contractor, \nserving the national interest. (Tr. 58-61) Applicant acknowledged that he cannot afford to \nbe irresponsible, given his current family responsibilities. (Tr. 68-69) \nBy far the largest debts in the SOR relate to child support. SOR \u00b6 1.f ($78,951) is \na debt to a child support agency in State C, where the mother of S1 used to live. (Tr. 79\u00ad\n80, 83-84) GE 3 reflects that the account was opened in January 2008, and was reported \nfor collection in April 20176. (GE 3 at 3) \nSOR \u00b6 1.a ($123,882) is a child support debt through State D, where Applicant \nnow lives. The figure alleged is taken from GE 4, an April 2019 credit report, but it is also \nlisted on GE 3 ($119,468). The account was opened in January 2008 and was reported \nfor collection in September 2017. (GE 3 at 3) \nApplicant acknowledged that his child support debts became delinquent because \nhe was negligent and irresponsible.

(Tr. 79, 105-107) \nThere is no indication that Applicant paid any child support for either D1 or S1 \nwhen he was unemployed and in school (2012-2016) Applicant testified that S1\u2019s mother \ntold him she intended to file for child support when S1 was about five or six years old, and \nhe acknowledged being negligent in response. (Tr. 122-124) Applicant testified that he \ndid not receive a court order for child support for S1. (Tr. 122-124) He said he took action \nto address the child support for S1 in 2017. (Tr. 105-106) \nIn his background interview, Applicant said child support for S1 was finalized in \nDecember 2016 and was finalized for D1 in December 2017. He said he paid $603.14 \nbiweekly through his pay. (GE 2 at 6) (Which child referenced here in the interview \nsummary is unclear, but is likely S1). There are no documents in the record from State B \nregarding either Applicant\u2019s child support requirements or payments to the mother of S1 \nwhen she lived there. (regarding SOR \u00b6 1.f) \nIn October 2017, Applicant was ordered by State A to pay $903 per month in child \nsupport to the mother of D1. (AE 2 at 7, 9) In May 2021, Applicant notified the State A \ncourt of a change in income because he had been unemployed since April 2020. He noted\nthat he had to pay child support from another relationship (S1) in the amount of $572. (AE\n2 at 13) He noted child support obligations through State D for two children (D1 and S1, \npresumably) of $1,475 a month, with a total balance due of $132,256. (AE 2 at 14) ($903\n+ 572 = $1,475) (AE 2; Tr. 102-103, 124-126, 134-135)  \n \n \n \n \nIn his hearing testimony, however, Applicant testified that he \u201cdidn\u2019t do a \nmodification. I stayed with the current amount as if I was [still working with contractor C] \nas in good faith thinking that I was going to go ahead and, you know, I\u2019ll find employment \nlater, or soon enough.\u201d (Tr. 67-68) \nApplicant also testified that he did not miss any child support payments due to his \nunemployment in 2020-2021. (Tr. 67-68) He appears to have been unemployed from \nabout April 2020 to April 2021. During this period, in fact, he was required to pay $903 \nper month to D1\u2019s mother. AE 3 reflects that he missed several payments, either in part \nor in full, until he regained employment and resumed making full payments (or more, for \narrearages) in September 2021. (AE 3 at 3-7) \nSimilarly, AE 4 reflects that Applicant missed several payments either in full ($572) \nor in part, during this period of unemployment until September 2021, when full payments \nresumed. (AE 4 at 2-4) \nApplicant also acknowledged that he also only began paying child support for D1 \nin 2017.

From July 2019 to May 2020, \nApplicant generally made his required payment, plus some arrearage payments. For \nsome subsequent months, he has made the full payment, and for other months he has \nnot. (AE 3) \nSince June 2020 Applicant\u2019s arrearage balances generally increased, with limited \nexceptions. Each month also reflects interest charges, initially of $139 per month, now up \nto over $320 per month. As of June 29, 2022, Applicant owed $38,661 in arrearages, and \n$25,240 in interest, for a total of $63,901 for D1. (AE 3) \nAE 4 shows State D\u2019s documentation of child support payments for S1 since July \n1, 2019. Some months show payments in full and some show partial payments. Most of \nthe months show an increase in arrearages. As of July 1, 2019, Applicant owed a balance \nof $82,063. It has now increased to $84,902.

(GE 3; AE 1 at 25) No SOR debt is \nspecifically linked to this account. \nApplicant believes his remaining SOR debts are resolved. (Tr. 126) Several of \nthem are past-due medical debts, all related to emergency room (ER) visits. These \ninclude SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b ($637), 1.c ($630), 1.d ($430), 1.e ($394), and 1.i ($228) (GE 4). \nApplicant testified and reported in his answer that he believes these debts have all been \npaid. (Tr. 81-87; Answer) He provided no documentation of these payments. \nSOR \u00b6 1.g ($3,244) is a federal student loan debt in collection. (GE 3) Applicant \nsaid he has been paying that debt since 2019 at $687 a month. He believes the debt is \nresolved. (Answer; Tr. 84-85, 90-92) He provided no documentation of these payments. \nSOR \u00b6 1.h ($889) is a cell-phone bill placed for collection.

He acknowledged that he had child support debts, but said he did not \nknow he owed \u201cthat much,\u201d and said he did not know of any arrearage. He did not review \nhis financial record for verification. He said he did not know about his debts until the \ninvestigator showed him his credit report.

(Tr. 109) \nApplicant acknowledged under questioning that he knew before October 2017 that \nhe owed child support that he was not paying. (Tr. 110) He acknowledged that he did not \nlist his child support debt on his application. When asked why not, he said thought child \nsupport was already listed on his 2017 e-QIP because of what was listed on his 2010 \napplication, though he acknowledged he did not update it in 2017 as he should have.

He said he paid $603.14 biweekly \nthrough his pay. (GE 2 at 6) \nApplicant\u2019s background interview resumed two days later. At the beginning of that \ninterview, he was confronted with various specific debts on his credit report, including the \ndebts at SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.g, 1.h, and the specifics of the child support debt at SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and \n1.f.

Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in conjunction \nwith the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. The protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 \n2(b) requires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe trustworthiness concern relating to the guideline for financial considerations is \nset out, in relevant part, in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. . . .  \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an individual might knowingly \ncompromise classified information in order to raise money. It encompasses concerns \nabout an individual\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting \nclassified information.

ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise trustworthiness concerns \nunder AG \u00b6 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nThe Government\u2019s credit reports and the record evidence establish all of the debts \nin the SOR. AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and 19(c) apply, with one exception. \nSOR \u00b6 1.f ($78,951) concerns past-due child support payments to the mother of \nS1 through State B. SOR \u00b6 1.a ($123,882) is the past-due child support debt through \nState D, where Applicant now lives. SOR \u00b6 1.a concerns the combined total for both D1 \nand S1, so the SOR \u00b6 1.f debt is included in that total. SOR \u00b6 1.f is therefore found for \nApplicant as it is essentially duplicative. \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate trustworthiness concerns \narising from financial difficulties. The following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are \npotentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n \n \n \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue. \n10 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant served four years on active duty in the Marine Corps (2003-2007), \nincluding service in Iraq and in combat. He worked for defense contractors for a number \nof years but then was unemployed from about 2012-2016 while pursuing an education. \nBy this time, he had two children with two different women. In about 2016 or 2017, the \nmothers of both of his children began pursuing child support payments. \nThe record is sparse with respect to any child support requirements or payments \nbefore then, and the amount of the child support owed is now well over $100,000. This \nsuggests that by the time the mothers of D1 and S1 filed for child support, Applicant was \nalready well behind. The record of Applicant\u2019s payments before July 2019 is also sparse, \nsince AE 3 and AE 4 go back to then but no further. Applicant testified that he began child \nsupport payments in 2017. \nSince July 2019, Applicant has made payments towards his child support \nobligations. Some have been payments in full for the month. Some have been more than \nthat, addressing arrearages. Some payments have been missed, resulting in increases \nin arrearage and interest. Applicant now owes almost $150,000 in past-due child support \nand interest for D1 and S1. Applicant\u2019s debts are not isolated, are clearly ongoing, and \ncontinue to cast doubt on his current judgment, trustworthiness, and reliability. AG \u00b6 20(a) \ndoes not apply. \nApplicant\u2019s child support obligations likely began after he returned from Iraq and \nleft active duty, in 2007. His first marriage was brief (though they did not divorce until \n2017). Applicant had another child in 2011. He was then unemployed for several years \nwhile pursuing an education (2012-2016). He does not appear to have paid child support \nduring this period, which is likely why the amount owed is so high. Applicant may also \nhave been depressed or suffering from PTSD or other issues related to his combat and \nmilitary service at the time. To some extent, Applicant\u2019s financial issues relate to \ncircumstances beyond his control. However, Applicant also acknowledged that his debts \nare due to his own negligence and irresponsibility. AG \u00b6 20(b) therefore only has limited \napplication. \nApplicant has not pursued credit counseling. He has also not established that there \nare clear indications that his financial issues are being resolved or are under control. In \nparticular, the fact that Applicant\u2019s child support debts and arrearages are now several \nthousand dollars more than they were as alleged in the SOR shows that Applicant\u2019s child \nsupport debts are not being resolved and are not under control. AG \u00b6 20(c) does not \napply. \nFor similar reasons, AG \u00b6 20(d) has little application. Applicant\u2019s non-child support \ndebts are comparatively quite small, as they involve a federal student loan, two cell phone \ndebts, and some medical debts from ER visits. Applicant testified that these debts have \nall been either paid, but he provided no supporting documentation. A current credit report \nshows no delinquencies, but the fact that a debt may have dropped off a credit report is \nnot enough to show that it is paid or otherwise resolved. Applicant also does not have \nenough of a track record of steady payments towards his child support debts, current or \n11 \n\n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \notherwise, to show ongoing good faith.

If so, repayment through \ngarnishment \u201cis not the same as, or similar to, a good-faith initiation of repayment by the \ndebtor.\u201d ISCR Case No. 08-06058 at 6 (App. Bd. Sept. 21, 2009). I cannot find that AG \u00b6 \n20(d) should fully apply. \nAG \u00b6 20(e) does not apply. Applicant disputed some of the smaller SOR debts and \nsaid that they had been paid, but provided no supporting documentation. \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the trustworthiness concern for personal conduct: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. . . \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a trustworthiness concern and may \nbe disqualifying. The following disqualifying conditions are potentially applicable: \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar \nform used to conduct investigations . . . determine national security eligibility \nor trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities. \nUnder Guideline E, the SOR alleged that Applicant falsified his September 2017 \ne-QIP in failing to disclose his federal debt, and his child support debt (SOR \u00b6 2.a) as well \nas his various other charged-off debts and debts in collection, current delinquencies, or \nother routine debts (SOR \u00b6 2.b), as required. He answered \u201cNo\u201d to all the financial \nquestions on the application. (GE 1 at 52-53) \nThe Government established that Applicant had numerous delinquencies, in \nSeptember 2017. Applicant acknowledged under questioning that he knew before \nOctober 2017 that he owed child support that he was not paying. (Tr. 110) He said thought \nchild support was already listed on his 2017 application because of what was listed on \nhis 2010 application, though he acknowledged he did not update it in 2017 as he should \nhave. (Tr. 110-111) He said much of his 2017 was pre-populated with information from \nhis prior application, and that he \u201cskipped over a lot of things.\u201d \n12 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nHowever, Applicant listed both D1 (born in 2006) and S1 (born in 2011) as his \nchildren on his September 2017 application, yet did not disclose that he owed past-due \nchild support for either child, as shown in GE 3. \nApplicant\u2019s statement in the Comments section of GE 1 put the Government on \nnotice that he had \u201ccurrent debts\u201d and had documentation about what he was doing about \nthem. However, his statement is not enough to put the Government on notice that \nApplicant had past-due debts, such as delinquent child support, a past-due federal \nstudent loan, and some other delinquencies, such as cell-phone debts and medical debts. \nI conclude that Applicant\u2019s passing reference to current debts on his e-QIP was not a \nsufficient disclosure of his financial delinquencies. \nI find further that Applicant knew enough about the status of his child support debts \nin September 2017 (involving two children, with two different women) that he knew and \nshould have known that he had a duty to report those debts at the very least. AG \u00b6 16(a) \napplies. It is not established as to the other debts alleged. \nAG \u00b6 17 sets forth the applicable mitigating conditions under Guideline E: \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; and \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment.  \nFalsification of a security clearance application is a serious matter. It goes to the \nheart of an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a clearance. Once established, it is not considered \nminor, and almost by definition casts doubt on an individual\u2019s reliability, and good \njudgment. AG \u00b6 17(c) does not apply. \nIn Applicant\u2019s first background interview, he was asked whether, in the past seven \nyears, he was delinquent on alimony or child support. He answered \u201cYes,\u201d and did so \nbefore being confronted with full evidence of his debts. (GE 2 at 6) Two days later, when \nhis interview resumed, he provided several documents related to his child support \nobligations. Those documents are not in evidence, but the fact that they are referenced \nin GE 2 is enough to show Applicant\u2019s intent in bringing the matter to the Government\u2019s \nattention. AG \u00b6 17(a) applies. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n13 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n       \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(a), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuidelines F and E in my whole-person analysis. \nI credit Applicant\u2019s military service, doubtless in difficult circumstances. He is a \ndisabled veteran, who clearly values service to the nation and its interests. I also credit \nApplicant\u2019s whole person evidence, as provided by the several witnesses he presented. \nHowever, Applicant has a long history of failing to live up to his family and fiduciary \nduties to his children and their mothers. Most of his debts are child support-related. Child \nsupport is a profoundly important fiduciary parental duty, and the fact that Applicant has \nongoing, even significantly increasing child-support debt has a direct bearing on his \neligibility for a position of public trust or a security clearance. Applicant rebutted or \nmitigated personal conduct trustworthiness concerns. He has made some efforts to \nresolve his child support debts but they are too large to be considered mitigated. He was \nalso given the opportunity to show documentation of resolution of his other debts and did \nnot do so. Thus, doubt over the status of those debts remains as well. The record \nevidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability \nfor a position of public trust. For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant mitigated personal \nconduct trustworthiness concerns, but did not provide sufficient evidence to mitigate \nfinancial considerations trustworthiness concerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.e:  \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.f:  \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.g-1.i:  \nAgainst Applicant \n14 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:   \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 2.a-2.b: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented, it is not clearly consistent with the \ninterests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for access to sensitive \ninformation.

His admissions \nare incorporated in my findings of fact. \nApplicant is a 47-year-old information security engineer employed by a defense \ncontractor since June 2013. He has been employed by defense contractors since January \n2006, and he received a security clearance in August 2007. \nApplicant married in November 1996, divorced in August 2015, and remarried in \nJune 2017. He has a 12-year-old daughter, a 17-year-old stepdaughter, and two 22-year-\nold stepsons. (Tr. 15.) He earned an associate\u2019s degree in information systems in May \n2006 and an associate\u2019s degree in network security in June 2012. (AX D.) He earned \nnumerous professional certificates in 2008 and 2009. (AX E.) \nApplicant served on active duty in the U.S. Navy from March 1993 to May 1997. \n(Tr. 32; AX A.) In December 1995, he was interviewed by criminal investigators \nconcerning his involvement in thefts from a Navy ship\u2019s store where he worked. He \nadmitted stealing two compact discs in October 1995; 18 compact discs, two magazines, \ntwo comic books, a compact disc holder, three oriental carvings, and a stereo system in \nNovember 1995; and 11 video tapes between mid-October and mid-November 1995. His \nstatement was typed, he initialed the beginning and end of each paragraph, and he stated \nunder oath that the typed statement was true and correct to the best of his knowledge \nand belief. (GX 4 at 11-12.) \nBased on Applicant\u2019s sworn statement, he was tried by court-martial in March 1996 \nand convicted of larceny. He was sentenced to a bad conduct discharge, reduction to the \nlowest enlisted pay grade, and confinement for three months. (GX 4 at 1.) \nWhen Applicant submitted an SCA in March 2007, he answered \u201cNo\u201d to the \nquestion, \u201cHave you ever served in the U.S. Military?\u201d He also answered \u201cNo\u201d to the \nquestion, \u201cHave you ever received [an] other than honorable discharge from the military?\u201d \n(GX 2 at 30-31.) He submitted another SCA in August 2017, seeking to continue his \nclearance, and he again answered \u201cNo\u201d to the question about military service and did not \ndisclose his bad conduct discharge.

The \nsummary of the interview reflects that the investigator questioned him about the \ninformation in his August 2017 SCA, including his educational background, employment \nrecord, family and associates, criminal history, and delinquent debts. The summary does \nnot reflect any questions about military service, and Applicant did not volunteer any \ninformation about it. (GX 3 at 5-13.) \nOn July 16, 2018, Applicant was interviewed again by a security investigator. The \ninvestigator asked him if he had ever served in the military, and he responded that he had \nserved in the Navy. Initially, he did not disclose that he had received a bad conduct \ndischarge. The investigator then confronted him with the evidence of his conviction of \nlarceny from the ship\u2019s store, and he admitted that he had been convicted of larceny and \nreceived a bad conduct discharge. He claimed that his only involvement in the thefts was \npurchasing some of the stolen items from a member of the team without knowing that \nthey were stolen. (GX 3 at 13-14.) He told the investigator that he had been advised by \nhis lawyer at the court-martial to admit being part of a team that was stealing from the \nship\u2019s store so that he would receive a lesser sentence. He pleaded guilty pursuant to a \nplea agreement limiting his punishment to a bad conduct discharge and confinement for \nthree months. (Tr. 54.) \nApplicant\u2019s July 2018 exculpatory description of his involvement in the thefts was \ninconsistent with his December 1995 sworn statement admitting the theft of multiple items \nover a two-month period. During the July 2018 interview, he admitted to the investigator \nthat he did not disclose his military service because he did not want his disciplinary record \nto adversely affect his career with the government. (GX 3 at 13-14.) \nAt the hearing, Applicant testified that he was questioned by Navy criminal \ninvestigators for several hours, and they told him that if he confessed to larceny he would \nbe confined for about 30 days and some of his pay would be taken, but he would not be \ndischarged from the Navy. He waived his right to an attorney during the questioning. The \nquestions were open-ended as in \u201cwhat did you steal,\u201d as opposed to leading questions \nasking him if he stole specific items. (Tr. 64.) At the hearing, he asserted that he \nconfessed to something he did not do so that he could stay in the Navy. (Tr. 24-25.) \nApplicant submitted two evaluation reports for November-December 2020 and \nApril-May 2021, reflecting that he is held in high regard by supervisors. (AX C.) Three \ncoworkers \nsubmitted \nstatements \nvouching \nfor \nApplicant\u2019s \nhonesty, \nintegrity, \ntrustworthiness, and technical skill. (AX B-1, B-2, and B-4.) Applicant\u2019s senior manager \nfor the past six years describes him as an exemplary team player with strong technical \nknowledge. (AX B-3.) None of these four statements indicate awareness of the conduct \nalleged in the SOR. \nApplicant\u2019s spouse is the assistant principal of an elementary school. She \nsubmitted a statement attesting to Applicant\u2019s participation in and support of student \nactivities at the school. (AX B-5.) Applicant also is active in Eagle Scout projects and \nprojects for elementary school girls.

Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 2. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge \napplies these guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \n\u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 15-01253 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2016). \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts.

It alleges that Applicant provided \nmaterially false information during a December 2017 security interview and a follow-up \ninterview in July 2018 by intentionally failing to disclose that he had served in the U.S. \nmilitary and had received a bad conduct discharge for larceny (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c and 1.d). \nFinally, it alleges that he provided materially false information in the follow-up interview in \nJuly 2018 by claiming that he unknowingly purchased stolen items from teammates, even \nthough he had admitted in a December 1995 statement that he had personally stolen \nitems from the ship\u2019s store for his personal use (SOR \u00b6 1.e). \nThe security concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 15: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. . . .  \nThe following disqualifying conditions under this guideline are relevant: \nAG \u00b616(a): deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant \nfacts from any personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, \nor similar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment \nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine national security eligibility \nor trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities; and \nAG \u00b616(b): deliberately providing false or misleading information; or \nconcealing or omitting information, concerning relevant facts to an \nemployer, investigator, security official, competent medical or mental health \nprofessional involved in making a recommendation relevant to a national \nsecurity eligibility determination, or other official government representative. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s admissions and the evidence submitted at the hearing are sufficient to \nestablish the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b, 1.c, and 1.e. The evidence of Applicant\u2019s \nconversations with security investigators is contained in summaries, not transcripts, \nmaking it impossible to determine the specific questions that were asked and the precise \nanswers that were given. The summary of the December 2017 interview reflects that the \ninvestigator questioned Applicant about the information reflected in the SCA. It does not \nspecifically reflect whether the investigator asked Applicant about military service during \nthat interview. However, Applicant admitted in his answer to the SOR that he intentionally \ndid not disclose the bad conduct discharge. \nAlthough Applicant admitted the allegation in SOR \u00b6 1.d in his answer to the SOR, \nthe summary of the July 2018 interview reflects that Applicant disclosed his military \nservice and bad conduct discharge in response to questions during that interview, albeit \nreluctantly. He then proceeded to falsely describe his involvement in the thefts from the \nship\u2019s store, as alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.e. \n. \nThe following mitigating conditions are relevant: \nAG \u00b6 17(a): the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; and \nAG \u00b6 17(c): the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior \nis so infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is unlikely \nto recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, trustworthiness, or \ngood judgment. \nAG \u00b6 17(a) is not established. Applicant did not correct his omissions from his 2007 \nSCA, 2017 SCA, and his December 2017 interview until he was confronted with the \nevidence in July 2018. \nAG \u00b6 17(c) is not established. Applicant\u2019s falsifications were frequent and did not \noccur under unusual circumstances. At the hearing, he admitted falsifying two SCAs and \ngiving false information during two security interviews. He asserted that his statement to \ncriminal investigators in December 2005 was coerced and false, and he admitted that he \ngave false answers to the military judge who inquired into the factual basis for his guilty \nplea in order to protect his pretrial agreement \nApplicant\u2019s falsification of two SCAs and false answers during the security \ninterviews are not minor. Falsification of a security clearance application \u201cstrikes at the \nheart of the security clearance process.\u201d ISCR Case No. 09-01652 (App. Bd. Aug. 8, \n2011.) It is a felony, punishable by a fine or imprisonment for not more than five years, or \nboth, to knowingly and willfully make any materially false, fictitious, or fraudulent \nstatement or representation in any matter within the jurisdiction of the executive branch \nof the Government of the United States. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001.

The second \nprong of AG \u00b6 17(c) focuses on whether the conduct was recent. There are no bright line \nrules for determining when conduct is recent. The determination must be based on a \ncareful evaluation of the totality of the evidence. See ISCR Case No. 02-24452 at 6 (App. \nBd. Aug. 4, 2004). If the evidence shows a significant period of time has passed without \nany evidence of misconduct, then an administrative judge must determine whether that \nperiod of time demonstrates changed circumstances or conduct sufficient to warrant a \nfinding of reform or rehabilitation. Id. \nApplicant\u2019s falsification of his SCAs and answers during security interviews were \nmore than three years ago, which is a significant period of time. However, he has been \nunder the pressure of retaining his security clearance since he received the SOR in \nSeptember 2019. He has not taken responsibility for his conduct. At the hearing, he \npersisted in his unconvincing claim that his confession in 1995 was coerced, that he was \nnot guilty of larceny, and that his bad conduct discharge was undeserved. Based on all \nthe evidence, I conclude that Applicant\u2019s lack of candor during the security clearance \nprocess has not been mitigated. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-\nperson concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process \nfactors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nI have incorporated my comments under Guideline E in my whole-person analysis \nand applied the adjudicative factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). I have considered the statements \nvouching for his honesty and integrity. I have also considered that he was granted a \nsecurity clearance since 2007, albeit by submitting a false SCA, and that he has no record \nof security violations. However, his favorable evidence is outweighed by his repeated lack \nof candor during the security clearance process. After weighing the disqualifying and \nmitigating conditions under that guideline, and evaluating all the evidence in the context \nof the whole person, I conclude Applicant has not mitigated the security concerns raised \nby his personal conduct. \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFormal Findings \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \nParagraph 1, Guideline E (Personal Conduct): AGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.c: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.d:  \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.e:  \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national security interests of the \nUnited States to grant Applicant eligibility for access to classified information.

The \naction was taken under Executive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry (February 20, 1960); Defense Industrial Personnel Security \nClearance Review Program, DoD Directive 5220.6 (January 2, 1992) (Directive); and \nSecurity Executive Agent Directive 4, establishing in Appendix A the National Security \nAdjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information or \nEligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position (AGs), effective June 8, 2017. \n1 \n\n \n \n                                                                                                                                              \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                            \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant responded to the SOR on August 15, 2019, and requested a hearing. \nThe case was assigned to me on February 25, 2022. A hearing was scheduled for April \n14, 2022, and heard on the date as scheduled. At the hearing, the Government\u2019s case \nconsisted of three exhibits (GEs 1-3). Applicant relied on two witnesses (including \nhimself) and 15 exhibits (AEs A-O). The transcript (Tr.) was received on April 27, 2022. \n   Procedural Issues \nBefore the close of the hearing, Applicant requested the record be kept open to \npermit him the opportunity to supplement the record with additional awards. For good \ncause shown, he was granted seven days to supplement the record. Department \nCounsel was afforded two days to respond. Within the time permitted, Applicant \nsupplemented the record with achievement awards he received between 2007 and \n2012. Applicant\u2019s submission was admitted without objections as Applicant\u2019s AE P. \nSummary of Pleadings \nUnder Guideline H, Applicant allegedly used marijuana from approximately 1991 \nto November 2018, after being granted a security clearance in December 2011. \nAllegedly, he used the substance in varying frequency. \nUnder Guideline E, Applicant allegedly falsified his electronic questionnaires for \ninvestigations processing (e-QIP) of December 2011 by omitting his marijuana use \nwithin the previous seven years. And, allegedly, he falsified his e-QIP of December \n2017 by omitting his marijuana use while possessing a security clearance. \nIn Applicant\u2019s response to the SOR, Applicant admitted all of the allegations \npertaining to prior marijuana use with explanations. He claimed he has not used \nmarijuana since November 2018. He also claimed to take his job as a systems engineer \nand his possession of a security clearance very seriously and will continue to hold this \nduty with the utmost respect and loyalty to the United States. \nApplicant further claimed to have incorrectly omitted his use of marijuana in both \ne-QIPs he completed. He attached negative test results from a September 2019 non-\nrandomized drug test, an assessment performed by a licensed substance abuse \ncounselor, and the summarized opinions of eight character witnesses who support his \nclearance application. \nAddressing the falsification allegations covered by SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.a-2.b, Applicant \nadmitted his alleged omissions with qualifications. He claimed his omissions were \nmistaken errors on his part. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant is a 47-year-old systems engineer for a defense contractor who seeks \na security clearance. The admitted allegations are incorporated and adopted as relevant \nand material findings.

(GE 3; Tr. 32) For Applicant, marijuana had a calming effect on his \nmental state and helped him stay focused and motivated. (GE 3) Typically, he smoked \nmarijuana with his spouse or friend. (GE 3) Claiming no outside pressure to use the \nsubstance, he assured that he used marijuana by choice.

Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988), \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a \nsecurity clearance.\u201d As Commander in Chief, \u201cthe President has the authority to control \naccess to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual \nis sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527.

Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe AGs list guidelines to be considered by judges in the decision-making \nprocess covering DOHA cases. These AG guidelines take into account factors that \ncould create a potential conflict of interest for the individual applicant, as well as \nconsiderations that could affect the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified information. The AG guidelines include conditions that could raise a \nsecurity concern and may be disqualifying (disqualifying conditions), if any, and all of \nthe conditions that could mitigate security concerns, if any.  \n5 \n\n \n \n                                                                                                                                              \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n \n          \n \n                                                         \nThese guidelines must be considered before deciding whether or not a security \nclearance should be granted, continued, or denied. Although, the guidelines do not \nrequire judges to place exclusive reliance on the enumerated disqualifying and \nmitigating conditions in the guidelines in arriving at a decision. \nIn addition to the relevant AGs, judges must take into account the pertinent \nconsiderations for assessing extenuation and mitigation set forth in \u00b6 2(a) of the AGs, \nwhich are intended to assist the judges in reaching a fair and impartial, commonsense \ndecision based on a careful consideration of the pertinent guidelines within the context \nof the whole person. The adjudicative process is designed to examine a sufficient period \nof an applicant\u2019s life to enable predictive judgments to be made about whether the \napplicant is an acceptable security risk. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s conduct, the relevant guidelines are to be \nconsidered together with the following \u00b6 2(d) factors: (1) the nature, extent, and \nseriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include \nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which \nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other \npermanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation of the conduct; (8) the potential for \npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or \nrecurrence. \nViewing the issues raised and evidence as a whole, the following individual \nguidelines are pertinent herein: \n  Drug Involvement \n The Concern: The illegal use of controlled substances, to include \nthe misuse of prescription drugs, and the use of other substances that \ncause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because  such behavior \nmay lead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, \nrules, and regulations. Controlled substance means any \u201ccontrolled \nsubstance\u201d as defined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic \nterm adopted in this guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed \nabove. \n   Personal Conduct \n \n           The Concern: Conduct involving questionable judgment, lack of \ncandor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations \ncan raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability, and trustworthiness, \nand ability to protect classified or sensitive information.

Considered \ntogether, Applicant\u2019s involvement with illegal drugs raise security concerns over whether \nApplicant\u2019s actions reflect pattern marijuana use incompatible with the judgment, \nreliability, and trustworthiness requirements for gaining access to classified information. \nAdditional security concerns are raised over Applicant\u2019s deliberate omissions of \nhis marijuana use in the e-QIPs he completed in 2011 and 2017.

On the strength of the evidence presented, \nthree disqualifying conditions (DCs) of the AGs for drug involvement apply to Applicant\u2019s \nsituation: DC \u00b6\u00b6 25(a), \u201dany substance misuse\u201d; 25(c), \u201cillegal possession of a controlled \nsubstance, including cultivation, processing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or \ndistribution; or possession of Illegal drugs or drug paraphernalia\u201d; and 25(f), \u201cany illegal \ndrug use while granted access to classified information or holding a sensitive position.\u201d \nTo his credit, Applicant has committed to abandoning all involvement with \nmarijuana. For over three years, he has remained abstinent from illegal drugs (inclusive \nof marijuana) and exhibits no visible signs or indications of succumbing to any risks or \npressures he might encounter to return to illegal drug use in the foreseeable future. \nRegularly tested (non-randomized) for illegal drug use (inclusive of marijuana) \nbetween 2019 and 2022, he has consistently produced negative testing results. \nApplicant\u2019s 2019 voluntary counseling session with a licensed substance abuse \ncounselor concluded with no positive diagnosis for a substance abuse disorder or \nprofessionally recommended need for further counseling. \nMoreover, Applicant exhibited candor about his past involvement with marijuana \nonce he made the belated decision to open up with the OPM investigator who \ninterviewed him in 2018. Overall, he has shown marked improvement in his judgment \nand maturity level in the three-plus years he has avoided marijuana use. \nApplicant\u2019s assurances of sustained abstinence from illegal drugs (inclusive of \nmarijuana) are encouraging. And, his efforts warrant partial application of two mitigating \nconditions (MCs) of the drug involvement guideline: MC \u00b6\u00b6 26(a), \u201cthe behavior \nhappened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened under such unusual \ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s \ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment\u201d; and 26(b), \u201cthe individual \nacknowledges his or her drug involvement and substance misuse, provides evidence of \nactions taken to overcome this problem, and has established a pattern of abstinence, \nincluding, but not limited to . . . , (2) changing or avoiding the environment where \ndrugs were used . . .\u201d \nStill, with the combination of extensive quantities of marijuana Applicant was \nexposed to over his 27 years of use and his persistent withholding of information about \nhis involvement with the drug, it is still too soon to absolve Applicant of risks of \nrecurrence. Without more time to establish a probative pattern of sustained abstinence \nfrom the use of illegal drugs, none of the mitigating conditions are fully available to \nApplicant at this time.

Trust and candor are core criteria for establishing eligibility to hold a \nsecurity clearance. \nWhile Applicant qualified the falsification allegations in the SOR (claiming his \nomissions to be mistakes), both his e-QIP omissions support drawn inferences of \nmaterial falsification. In turn, his collective responses to the drug-related questions in \nthe e-QIPs he completed warrant the application of DC \u00b6 16(a), \u201cdeliberate omission, \nconcealment, or falsification of relevant facts from any personnel security questionnaire, \npersonal history statement, or similar form used to conduct investigations, determine \nemployment qualifications, award benefits or status, determine national security \neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities.\u201d \nIn a follow-up PSI in December 2018, Applicant initially denied any prior \nmarijuana use when responding to questions about any prior illegal drug involvement by \nthe interviewing OPM investigator. Only after having a change of heart about disclosing \nhis prior marijuana involvement towards the end of his PSI did he elect to volunteer with \nta full accounting of his marijuana use history. Applicant\u2019s initial denials of past \nmarijuana use in his PSI warrant the application of DC \u00b6 16 (b), \n\u201cdeliberately providing false or misleading information, or concealing \nrelevant facts to an employer, investigator, security official, competent \nmedical \nor \nmental \nhealth \nprofessional \ninvolved \nin \nmaking \na \nrecommendation relevant to a national security eligibility determination, or \nother official government representative.\u201d \nHaving worked through two prior e-QIPs (one in 2011 and another in 2017) with \nhis withholding his extensive history of marijuana use and sticking to his story when \nresponding initially to drug-related questions posed by the OPM investigator, Applicant \ncannot fairly or reasonably meet the prompt disclosure requirements of MC \u00b6 17(a), \u201cthe \nindividual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, concealment, or \nfalsification before being confronted with the facts.\u201d \nIn a previous Appeal Board case with similar facts, the Appeal Board held that an \napplicant who failed to fully disclose her illegal drug use history in two previously \ncompleted security clearance applications and opened up voluntarily late in an ensuing \ninterview subsequently conducted by an agent of the Defense Investigative Service \n(DIS) five months later, failed to satisfy the prompt prong of the potentially available \nmitigating condition.

His laudatory endorsements from coworkers, friends, and \nfamily members, while commendable, are not enough to counter his material omissions \nof his past marijuana use. \nWhile this is not a close case, even close cases must be resolved in the favor of \nthe national security. See Dept. of Navy v. Egan, supra. Quite apart from any candor \nexpectation the Government may have for the clearance holder employed by a defense \ncontractor, the Government has the right to expect honesty and candor from the trust \nrelationship it has with the clearance holder. See Snepp v. United States, 444 U.S. 507, \n511n.6 (1980) \nWhole-person assessment \nFrom a whole-person perspective, Applicant has failed to establish enough \nindependent probative evidence of his overall honesty, trustworthiness, maturity and \ngood judgment required of those who seek eligibility to hold a security clearance or \nsensitive position. He lacks enough positive reinforcements and time in abstinence from \nactive use of illegal drugs to facilitate safe predictions he is at no risk of recurrence. \nConsidering the record as a whole at this time, and granting due weight to the \npositive steps Applicant has taken to sustain his commitments to abstinence, there is \ninsufficient probative evidence of sustainable mitigation in the record to make safe \npredictable judgments about Applicant\u2019s ability to avoid illegal drugs in the foreseeable \nfuture. Taking into account all of the facts and circumstances surrounding Applicant\u2019s \ndrug activities over a 27-year period with only three-plus years of sustained abstinence, \nhe does not mitigate security concerns with respect to the allegations covered by SOR \n\u00b6\u00b61.a and 2.a-2-b. \nI have carefully applied the law, as set forth in Department of Navy v. Egan, 484 \nU.S. 518 (1988), Exec. Or. 10865, the Directive, and the AGs, to the facts and \ncircumstances in the context of the whole person, I conclude drug involvement and \npersonal conduct security concerns are not mitigated.

A witness \nfor the government testified, and Government Exhibits (GE) 1 through 8 were admitted in \nevidence. Applicant testified and submitted Applicant\u2019s Exhibit (AE) A, which was \nadmitted. DOHA received the hearing transcript (Tr.) on September 27, 2021. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant is a 38-year-old training and development specialist, employed by a \ndefense contractor. He previously worked for another defense contractor from April 2016 \nto March 2017, until he was terminated for violating timekeeping and information systems \nsecurity policies. He was also employed as a United States Secret Service uniformed \ndivision officer from 2008 to 2010. He received a bachelor\u2019s degree in 2006. He married \nin 2008 and divorced in 2014. He remarried in November 2018. He has three children, \nages 18 months, 10, and 14 years old. He holds a top secret security clearance. \nThe SOR alleges under Guideline E that Applicant was terminated from his \nemployment with a government contractor in March 2017 for violating timekeeping and \ninformation systems security policies. Under Guideline M, the SOR cross-alleges \nApplicant\u2019s termination for violating information systems security policy. Applicant initially \nadmitted the Guideline E allegation, but denied the Guideline M allegation. At the hearing, \nhe changed his answer on the Guideline M allegation to \u201cadmit.\u201d \nApplicant was employed by a company that directly supported another government \nagency, by researching classified computer databases in a sensitive compartmented \ninformation facility (SCIF) in which he was required to \u201cbadge in\u201d to gain access. All work \nhad to be conducted in the SCIF. Applicant was to account for his time and attendance \nby logging his work time daily on an unclassified computer database, in 15-minute \nincrements. The timekeeping program could be accessed anywhere on a personal \ncomputer, including at Applicant\u2019s home. The system employed a unique username and \npassword, and only the employee was permitted to sign in and use the system. If an \nemployee could not enter the data, he was required to call or email his supervisor, or \nsend a note through the timekeeping system. The employee\u2019s input would be used to \ncharge the government customer under the contract. Applicant was also required to report \nhis time on a classified system in the SCIF, to include noting on the government \ncustomer\u2019s calendar when he expected to be out of the office or unable to work normal \nwork hours. Employees were required to keep the calendar updated. Applicant was \ntrained on the timekeeping system and information security requirements. \nIn late 2016, the government supervisor in the SCIF notified Applicant\u2019s senior \nprogram manager of concerns over Applicant\u2019s extended breaks and arriving to work late \nor leaving early. The manager asked the SCIF supervisors to make notes and observe \nApplicant\u2019s conduct. It was discovered that between January and February 2017, \nApplicant falsified his timecard by logging work that was not performed for seven days. \nThe missed work was improperly billed to the government. In addition, the company \ndetermined that Applicant did not \u201cbadge in\u201d to the SCIF on six days for which he entered \nwork hours. The manager confronted Applicant about the falsified timecards, and he \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ndenied it, but admitted to improperly certified working on two days that he did not work. \nApplicant did not elaborate on missed work or claim that he worked on alternate times or \ndays to make up for missed regular workdays. The manager believed Applicant was lying \nabout only falsifying two days of missed work. \nThe company conducted an internal audit and Applicant was interviewed. \nApplicant admitted fraudulently certifying working two days that he did not work. He also \nadmitted to giving his username and password to his girlfriend (now his spouse), to log \ninto the timekeeping system and sending a certification of his work performed for the \nweek. As a result, Applicant was placed on administrative leave, was \u201cread off\u201d the \nprogram, and barred from the SCIF. The manager notified Applicant that he was being \nterminated. Applicant never contested his termination with the company because he \nagreed that he mischarged two days and improperly allowed his girlfriend to certify his \nwork hours. \nIn testimony, Applicant continued to assert that he mischarged only two days, but \ncorrected his timecard the following week to take leave. He stated that he had no desire \nto contest his termination from the company because he agreed that he initially \nmischarged the two days and allowed his girlfriend to submit his timecard. He also \nadmitted to following another employee into the SCIF without \u201cbadging in,\u201d as a way to \naccount for the inability of the system to show he was present in the SCIF, however he \nlater denied it in testimony, claiming that he always \u201cbadged in\u201d even when he walked in \nbehind another employee. \nApplicant claimed that he went to the emergency room in late February 2017, and \nwas required to undergo an emergency procedure. He first testified that it was February \n4th  or 5th, then said it was the week of February 9th  or 10th. His girlfriend took him to the \nhospital on a Wednesday evening after work for a test when he learned that he needed \na procedure. At his direction, she returned home to open his laptop timekeeping program \nin which he had already logged in and pre-populated the fields with his work time for the \nweek, and hit \u201csend\u201d on the program. She then returned to the hospital. Applicant admitted \nto regularly pre-populating his timecard before working the hours. When his girlfriend \ncertified his timecard for him, he had populated work for the full week although he certified \nthe timecard on a Wednesday evening. In testimony, Applicant claimed he regularly \npopulated the entire work week on his timecard submissions, typically sent on Thursdays, \nbut he did not know he had populated the entire week when he asked his girlfriend to \ncertify his work. Applicant claimed that he asked her to certify it on Wednesday evening, \neven though he normally submitted it on Thursdays, because he did not know how long \nhe would be in the hospital. He also stated that he could have accessed the program on \nhis cell phone while in the hospital, but he was \u201cout of it\u201d and in too much pain to do so. \nApplicant produced character letters from friends and community leaders attesting \nto his honesty, reliability, family focus, and community involvement. He did not produce \ndocumentary evidence to support his claims regarding timekeeping or his hospital visit, \nnor did he produce his spouse or other witnesses to testify as to the events the evening \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nhe went to the hospital, company\u2019s timekeeping policies, SCIF entry practices, and work \nschedules. \nPolicies \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v.

As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527.

Or. 10865 \u00a7 2. \nNational security eligibility is predicated upon the applicant meeting the criteria \ncontained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. \nInstead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge applies \nthese guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative \njudge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider a person\u2019s stability, trustworthiness, reliability, \ndiscretion, character, honesty, and judgment. AG \u00b6 1(b). \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \n\u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR.

The guidelines presume a \nnexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria listed \ntherein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability.

This includes \nbut is not limited to, consideration of: \n.\n. \n. \n(3) a pattern of dishonesty or rule violations; and \n(4) evidence of significant misuse of Government or other employer\u2019s \ntime or resources. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s admissions and the evidence support a finding of questionable \njudgment, dishonesty, company policy violations, and misuse of the government\u2019s and \nhis employer\u2019s time and resources. AG \u00b6\u00b6 16(c) and (d) apply. \nConditions that could mitigate personal conduct security concerns are provided \nunder AG \u00b6 17. The following are potentially applicable: \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that caused untrustworthy, unreliable, \nor other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to recur; and \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate vulnerability \nto exploitation, manipulation, or duress. \nApplicant\u2019s conduct, taken as a whole, shows the wrongful use of the company\u2019s \ntimekeeping policies to permit his girlfriend to certify his time that he knew or should have \nknown was incorrect, and repeated mischarging of time that was not worked. He admitted \nthat this was a violation of company policy. I found Applicant\u2019s testimony to be elusive, at \ntimes evasive, and utterly unconvincing. He failed to produce sufficient evidence to \ncounter the testimony of the government\u2019s witness and the company\u2019s records. In \ntestimony, Applicant also admitted to, and then denied, improperly entering a SCIF \nwithout \u201cbadging in\u201d as required. Although this was not alleged in the SOR and will not be \nconsidered for disqualifying purposes, it may be considered when making a credibility \ndetermination, in the application of mitigating conditions, and in my whole-person \nanalysis. \nBased on the totality of the allegations and recurring inappropriate conduct, \nApplicant\u2019s judgment continues to be questionable. He has not submitted sufficient \nevidence to alleviate those concerns. The allegations are not minor, nor did they occur in \nunique circumstances where they are not likely to recur. He has not accepted full \nresponsibility for his conduct, and failed to show sufficient mitigating evidence. I find no \nmitigating condition is fully applicable. \nGuideline M: Use of Information Technology \nAG \u00b6 39 expresses the security concern pertaining to use of information \ntechnology systems: \nFailure to comply with rules, procedures, guidelines or regulations \npertaining to information technology systems may raise security concerns \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nabout an individual\u2019s reliably and trustworthiness, calling into question the \nwillingness or ability to properly protect sensitive systems, networks, and \ninformation. Information Technology Systems includes any computer-\nbased, mobile, or wireless device used to create, store, access, process, \nmanipulate, protect, or move information. This includes any component, \nwhether integrated into a larger system or not, such as hardware, software, \nor firmware, used to enable or facilitate these operations.  \nAG \u00b6 40 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. I considered the following relevant: \n(e) unauthorized use of any information technology system. \nApplicant wrongly permitted his girlfriend to certify his timecard on his behalf, a \nviolation of company policy. AG \u00b6 40(e) applies. \nI have considered all of the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 41 and considered \nthe following relevant: \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the behavior happened, or it happened \nunder such unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur and does not \ncast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the misuse was minor and done solely in the interest of organizational \nefficiency and effectiveness; \n(c) the conduct was unintentional or inadvertent and was followed by a \nprompt, good-faith effort to correct the situation and by notification to \nappropriate personnel; and \n(d) the misuse was due to improper or inadequate training or unclear \ninstructions. \n7 \n \nApplicant\u2019s conduct was intentional, recent, and recurring. He was trained and \nunderstood how to use the timekeeping system. He showed poor judgment and was \nterminated for violations of the company and security policies. Applicant admitted to \nimproperly allowing his girlfriend to certify his timecard, but attempted to justify his actions \nbased on his medical condition at the time. This incident alone may be mitigated by time \nor otherwise minor, but overall, I find Applicant\u2019s response to the allegations to be evasive, \nunrepentant, and unconvincing. He did not submit sufficient evidence to refute the \nGovernment\u2019s allegations, and I am convinced his improper use of the timecard system \nwas knowing and intentional. No mitigating condition fully applies. \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_______________________ \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder AG \u00b6\u00b6 2(a), 2(c), and 2(d), the ultimate determination of whether to grant \nnational security eligibility must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. Under the whole-person \nconcept, the administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security \nclearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process \nfactors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d). \nI considered all of the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of \nall the facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my findings of \nfact and comments under Guidelines E and M in my whole-person analysis. \nApplicant has not taken convincing steps to acknowledge his behavior and the \nimpact it had on his company and the government client. He did not present sufficient \nmitigating evidence or convincingly refute the Government\u2019s allegations. Accordingly, I \nconclude he has not carried his burden of showing that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational security interests of the United States to grant or continue eligibility for access to \nclassified information. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline E: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.a: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline M:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national security interest of the \nUnited States to grant Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact In Applicant\u2019s answer to the SOR, he admitted the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.f, alleging multiple arrests for various offenses between April 2008 and November 2018. He denied the allegation in SOR \u00b6 2.a, alleging purchase and use of marijuana with varying frequency from 2001 to about 2013 or 2014. He admitted the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 3.a and 3.b, alleging that he falsified his SCAs in February 2007 and February 2017 by deliberate failure to disclose his drug involvement. His admissions in his answer and at the hearing are incorporated in my findings of fact. Applicant is a 33-year-old vehicle refueler employed by a defense contractor since October 2005. He received a security clearance in May 2007. He has never married, but he has lived with a cohabitant since October 2016. He and his cohabitant have a daughter who was born on December 17, 2019. (Tr. 19; AX F.) Applicant testified that he began using marijuana in occasional social settings in 2001, when he was 14 years old, and he used it until about 2013 or 2014. He testified that he stopped using it because his employer started random drug testing, and he realized that it could jeopardize his job. (Tr. 23.) In Applicant\u2019s first SCA in February 2007, he answered \u201cNo\u201d to the question whether he had used a drug or controlled substance within the past seven years. (GX 1 at 23.) During a personal subject interview in September 2018, he told an investigator that he last used marijuana at age 24. (GX 3 at 4.) At",

On January 30, 2020, Department Counsel \nrequested a hearing. Department Counsel was ready to proceed on February 20, 2020, \nand the case was assigned to me on March 12, 2020. On the same day, the Defense \nOffice of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) notified Applicant that the hearing was scheduled \nfor March 31, 2020. The hearing was cancelled on March 17, 2020, because of the \nCOVID-19 pandemic. \nOn April 7, 2021, I notified Applicant by email that his hearing was tentatively \nrescheduled for April 29, 2021, by video teleconference. He telephonically requested a \nlater date, and the hearing was rescheduled for May 12, 2021, by video teleconference. I \nconvened the hearing as rescheduled. Government Exhibits (GX) 1 through 13 were \nadmitted in evidence without objection. Applicant testified but did not present the \ntestimony of any other witnesses or submit any documentary evidence. DOHA received \nthe transcript (Tr.) on May 26, 2021. \nI kept the record open until May 21, 2021, to enable Applicant to submit \ndocumentary evidence. I issued my decision on June 10, 2021, in which I concluded that \nhe had not submitted any documentary evidence. Applicant appealed my adverse \ndecision, contending that he had submitted evidence on May 20, 2021, that I had not \nconsidered. The Appeal Board remanded the case and directed me to reopen the record \nand provide Applicant an opportunity to submit additional evidence. \nIn accordance with the Appeal Board mandate, I reopened the record. I reviewed \nall email sent to me on May 20, 2021, and a found an email transmitting the evidence that \nApplicant had sent. (Hearing Exhibit (HX) I.) The email had been overlooked because the \nsender of the email was identified by a series of letters and numbers bearing no \nresemblance to Applicant\u2019s name. Applicant\u2019s email was discovered by opening all emails \nwith attachments that had been received on May 20, 2021. I admitted his documentary \nevidence as Applicant\u2019s Exhibits (AX) A through F. \nOn September 25, 2021, I notified Applicant by email that I would consider the \nadditional evidence that he had submitted on May 20, 2021, and I gave him until October \n1, 2021, to submit any additional materials that he wanted me to consider. In order to \nmake sure that Applicant received my email, I sent it by replying to Applicant\u2019s May 20, \n2021 email that he used to submit his additional evidence. (HX II.) I did not receive any \nadditional evidence beyond AX A through F. I issued my decision on remand on October \n14, 2021. \nOn November 5, 2021, I received a letter and a fax from Applicant submitting \nadditional evidence. I informed him that I had issued my decision on October 14, 2021, \nand I no longer had jurisdiction over the case. I suggest that if he wished to submit \nadditional matters, he should send them to the Appeal Board.

The \nAppeal Board remanded the case again and directed me to reopen the record and provide \nApplicant an opportunity to submit additional evidence. \nOn January 28, 2022, I notified Applicant by certified mail that I had opened the \nrecord to consider all the items that he had submitted. I also afforded him the opportunity \nto submit any additional documents for my consideration. (HX V.) \nOn February 8, 2022, Applicant submitted the following documents: \n\uf0b7 Three documents attesting to his good character: (1) a statement from a friend \n(previously admitted as AX A); (2) a statement from his mother (previously \nadmitted as AX B), and (3) a statement from his cohabitant (marked and admitted \nas AX H; \n\uf0b7 A photograph of his daughter\u2019s dedication certificate (previously admitted as AX \nF); \n\uf0b7 A photograph of a 15-year tenure clock (previously admitted as AX D); \n\uf0b7 A photograph of 15-year memorabilia (previously admitted as AX E.); \n\uf0b7 Two pages from the summary of a personal subject interview conducted on \nSeptember 27, 2018, in which he stated that he last used marijuana at age 24, \nbearing his notarized signature (previously admitted as GX 3 at 4; marked and \nadmitted as AX I); \n\uf0b7 A certificate of completion of a 12-session anger-management program (marked \nand admitted as AX J); and \n\uf0b7 A certificate of completion of an Alcohol Safety Action Program, including 8 weeks \nof alcohol education, 16 weeks of group outpatient substance abuse treatment, \nand completion of an interlock requirement (marked and admitted as AX K). \nI admitted Applicant\u2019s additional evidence as AX G through K and reconsidered \nmy decision in accordance with the Appeal Board\u2019s remand. \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \nFindings of Fact \nIn Applicant\u2019s answer to the SOR, he admitted the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.f, \nalleging multiple arrests for various offenses between April 2008 and November 2018. He \ndenied the allegation in SOR \u00b6 2.a, alleging purchase and use of marijuana with varying \nfrequency from 2001 to about 2013 or 2014. He admitted the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 3.a \nand 3.b, alleging that he falsified his SCAs in February 2007 and February 2017 by \ndeliberate failure to disclose his drug involvement. His admissions in his answer and at \nthe hearing are incorporated in my findings of fact. \nApplicant is a 33-year-old vehicle refueler employed by a defense contractor since \nOctober 2005. He received a security clearance in May 2007. He has never married, but \nhe has lived with a cohabitant since October 2016. He and his cohabitant have a daughter \nwho was born on December 17, 2019. (Tr. 19; AX F.) \nApplicant testified that he began using marijuana in occasional social settings in \n2001, when he was 14 years old, and he used it until about 2013 or 2014. He testified \nthat he stopped using it because his employer started random drug testing, and he \nrealized that it could jeopardize his job. (Tr. 23.) \nIn Applicant\u2019s first SCA in February 2007, he answered \u201cNo\u201d to the question \nwhether he had used a drug or controlled substance within the past seven years. (GX 1 \nat 23.) During a personal subject interview in September 2018, he told an investigator \nthat he last used marijuana at age 24. (GX 3 at 4.) At the hearing, he testified that he \ncould not remember why he did not disclose his marijuana use in his 2007 SCA. (Tr. 27-\n28.) He also testified that there was no reason why he continued to use marijuana until \n2014, except stupidity. (Tr. 30.) \nApplicant was arrested in April 2008 and charged with brandishing a firearm. His \narrest occurred after he was involved in a bar fight, and one of the participants told police \nthat he had brandished a firearm. The police stopped him as he drove away from the \nscene of the fight. He testified that he has never owned a firearm. The police searched \nthe vehicle and did not find a firearm. He appeared in court and was found not guilty \nbecause the police were unable to find a firearm. (GX 4 at 3; Tr. 34-35.) \nApplicant was arrested in February 2009 and charged with possession of \nmarijuana. After the police stopped him for speeding, they found marijuana in the center \nconsole of his car. He appeared in court and adjudication was deferred. He was placed \non probation for one year, required to attend drug-education classes, and was subjected \nto random urinalysis. He successfully completed his probation and the charges were \ndismissed. (GX 4 at 3; GX 5.) \nIn November 2010, Applicant was arrested and charged with possession of \nmarijuana and having defective equipment on his car. After Applicant completed a period \nof probation and drug classes, the prosecutor filed a nolle prosequi. (GX 12.)

He testified that he was unaware \nof any requirement to disclose arrests to his employer. (Tr. 39.) \nIn January 2011, Applicant was charged with reckless driving, having an open \ncontainer of alcohol in his car, and possession of marijuana. Applicant was with his \ncousin, and he told the police that the marijuana was his, because he did not want his \ncousin to get in trouble. (Tr. 44-45.) Applicant was convicted of the open-container offense \nand reckless driving, but the marijuana charge was dismissed. (GX 13.) \nIn November 2013, Applicant was arrested for maliciously causing bodily injury to \nhis cohabitant. He testified that his cohabitant was driving home after they had been \ndrinking at a bar, they began arguing, his cohabitant began swerving, and he grabbed the \nsteering wheel to keep the car from striking a guardrail. The police officer who noticed the \nswerving stopped them, noticed a cut on the cohabitant\u2019s forehead, and concluded that \nApplicant had hit her in the face. Applicant spent a week in jail after his arrest. (Tr. 53-\n55.) The charge was later reduced to assault and battery. In February 2014, the court \nfound \u201cfacts sufficient to find guilt,\u201d but deferred adjudication for one year. The charge \nwas dismissed in February 2015. (GX 7.) \nApplicant submitted his second SCA in February 2017. He answered \u201cNo\u201d to a \nquestion whether, during the last seven years, he had illegally used any drugs or \ncontrolled substances. He also answered \u201cNo\u201d to a question whether he had ever used \nor otherwise been involved with a drug or controlled substance while possessing a \nsecurity clearance. (GX 2 at 26.) \nApplicant did not disclose the February 2009 arrest, the November 2010 arrest, or \nthe January 2011 arrest in his February 2017 SCA. He testified that he did not disclose \nhis January 2011 arrest because he was told that his arrest record would be expunged. \n(Tr. 31.) \nWhen Applicant was interviewed by a security investigator in September 2018, he \ntold the investigator that he had never been charged with an offense related to alcohol or \ndrugs. He did not disclose his drug involvement until the investigator confronted him with \nevidence of his arrest record, which included drug offenses. He then disclosed his \nmarijuana use, beginning in his teenage years and ending in 2014. He told the investigator \nthat he did not disclose his marijuana use while holding a security clearance because it \ndid not matter, since he had stopped using marijuana. He also told the investigator that \nhe did not disclose his marijuana use because he misread the question and thought he \nwas required to disclose only what had occurred in the last seven or ten years. (GX 3 at \n12-13.) At the hearing, he admitted that he did not disclose his marijuana involvement \nbecause he was nervous, scared, and afraid that it would jeopardize his security \nclearance or his job. (Tr. 31-33.) \nIn July 2018, Applicant was charged with assault and battery on his cohabitant. \nApplicant testified that he was driving home after work after a long work day and spending \nsome time after work at a friend\u2019s house.

His cohabitant came to the scene and was taking him home when they began \narguing, because his cohabitant refused to take him to a hospital. Applicant became angry \nand cracked the windshield of their car by punching it with his fist. His cohabitant called \nthe police, who concluded that they had been fighting. (Tr. 57-63.) A protective order was \nissued, prohibiting Applicant from having any contact with his cohabitant for three days. \n(GX 9.) \nApplicant testified that he was charged and the protective order was issued \nbecause his cohabitant \u201cgot all hysterical\u201d and told the police that he had smacked her. \nHe admitted that, on several occasions, he grabbed her and shook her after she said \nthings intended to provoke him. (Tr. 50-51.) In September 2018, he appeared in court and \npleaded no contest. The judge found \u201cfacts sufficient to find guilt,\u201d placed Applicant on \nprobation, and deferred adjudication until September 2020. (GX 8.) Applicant completed \nhis probation and the charge was dismissed. (Tr. 63.)  \nApplicant and his cohabitant stayed apart for about seven or eight months after his \narrest. (Tr. 64.) He testified that most of their arguments arose from his cohabitant\u2019s desire \nthat he stay at home instead of socializing with friends away from home and her practice \nof saying things that she knew would provoke him. He testified that the arguments and \nphysical violence stopped after their daughter was born. (Tr. 51-52.) \nIn November 2018, Applicant was arrested and charged with driving under the \ninfluence (DUI). His blood-alcohol content (BAC) was 0.17. In the jurisdiction where he \nwas arrested, jail time is mandatory for a BAC at or above 0.15. In March 2019, Applicant \nwas convicted and sentenced to 180 days in jail, with 175 days suspended, and a $250 \nfine. He was placed on unsupervised probation for one year. His driver\u2019s license was \nrestricted for one year, and he was required to install an ignition interlock on his vehicle. \n(GX 10.) He served his jail sentence on weekends. (Tr. 66.) He completed eight weeks \nof alcohol education in August 2019, and 16 weeks of group outpatient substance abuse \ntreatment in October 2019. He was allowed to remove the ignition interlock in January \n2020. The record of his treatment does not include a diagnosis or prognosis. (AX K.) \nApplicant admitted that many of his arrests were related to alcohol, but he does \nnot believe he has an alcohol problem. He has reduced his drinking since the birth of his \ndaughter. He testified that he drinks mainly on weekends and limits himself to about two \ndrinks or two beers. (Tr. 67.) \nA friend of Applicant who has known him for 12 years submitted a statement \ndescribing Applicant as \u201ca very respectful and honest gentleman\u201d and \u201cthe type of person \nthat will give you the shirt off his back.\u201d The friend did not indicate whether he was familiar \nwith Applicant\u2019s criminal record. (AX A.) \nApplicant\u2019s mother submitted a statement acknowledging that Applicant has done \nthings \u201cthat have not been pleasing to the way of his teaching,\u201d but stating that he is now \na family-oriented person who is striving to be a better person.

(AX B.) \nApplicant submitted photographs of a clock and various memorabilia containing \nthe numeral 15, which he received in recognition of 15 years of service. (AX C, D, and E.) \nApplicant\u2019s cohabitant submitted a letter (AX H) including the following comments: \n[Applicant] has gone through a lot of changes and learning experiences \nwhether good or bad. He strives to be a better person and a better man. \nOne thing I can say is that [Applicant] is a hard worker, dedicated and \nalways willing to learn new things. \nAfter separating we decided to work on getting back together and decided \nto attend church. We\u2019ve made a commitment to attend church and hoped \nthat our relationship would get better. After all these years God blessed us \nwith our first child. [Applicant] was there fully committed while I was \npregnant and was there for most of my doctor appointments as long as his \njob permitted it. And when our daughter was born I saw the look on his face \nas a proud first-time father. \nHe is an awesome father who is there for our daughter hand in hand. With \nour work and busy schedules he makes sure that he is there to pick her up \nfrom daycare and make sure that she is well taken care of at all times. He \nloves our daughter with all his heart and he works very hard to make sure \nshe has everything that she needs. \nPolicies \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 2. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge \napplies these guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \n\u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 15-01253 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2016).  \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, \nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-\n31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).  \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-\n20700 at 3 (App. Bd.

By its very nature, it \ncalls into question a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, and \nregulations.\u201d Applicant\u2019s admissions and the evidence presented at the hearing establish \nthe disqualifying condition in AG \u00b6 31(b): \u201cevidence (including, but not limited to, a credible \nallegation, an admission, and matters of official record) of criminal conduct, regardless of \nwhether the individual was formally charged, prosecuted, or convicted.\u201d \nThe following mitigating conditions are potentially relevant: \nAG \u00b6 32(a): so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior \nhappened, or it happened under such unusual circumstances, that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \nAG \u00b6 32(c): no reliable evidence to support that the individual committed \nthe offense; and \nAG \u00b6 32(d): there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including, but not \nlimited to, the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, \nrestitution, compliance with the terms of parole or probation, job training or \nhigher education, good employment record, or constructive community \ninvolvement. \nAG \u00b6 32(a) is not established.

He \nsuccessfully completed the terms of his probation in March 2020, almost two years ago. \nIn my previous decision, I noted that much of his criminal conduct was alcohol-related, \nand I expressed concern that his volatile relationship with his cohabitant would recur. \nBased on the passage of time and my consideration of AX H, J, and K, I have \nreconsidered my adverse decision regarding the allegations of criminal conduct under \nGuideline J. The severe consequences of Applicant\u2019s last DUI conviction apparently \ngained his attention. The birth of his daughter was a significant event for him. He has \nmoderated his alcohol consumption since her birth, and he and his cohabitant have \nreevaluated and adjusted their relationship. Applicant no longer spends his off-duty time \ndrinking with friends and is now focused on caring for their daughter. \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nGuideline H, Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nThe SOR alleges that Applicant purchased and used marijuana with varying \nfrequency from about 2001 to 2013 or 2014, and that his use of marijuana continued after \nhe was granted access to classified information in May 2007 (SOR \u00b6 2.a). The concern \nunder this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 24: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual's reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior may \nlead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. Controlled substance means any \"controlled substance\" as \ndefined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term adopted in \nthis guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above. \nApplicant\u2019s admissions and the evidence submitted at the hearing establish the \nfollowing disqualifying conditions under this guideline: \nAG \u00b6 25(a): any substance misuse (see above definition); \nAG \u00b6 25(c): illegal possession of a controlled substance, including \ncultivation, processing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or \npossession of drug paraphernalia; and \nAG \u00b6 25(f): any illegal drug use while granted access to classified \ninformation or holding a sensitive position. \nThe following mitigating conditions are potentially applicable: \nAG \u00b6 26(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \nhappened under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not \ncast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; and \nAG \u00b6 26(b): the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this \nproblem, and has established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not \nlimited to: (1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; (2) \nchanging or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; and (3) \nproviding a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug involvement \nand substance misuse, acknowledging that any future involvement or \nmisuse is grounds for revocation of national security eligibility. \n10 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nBoth mitigating conditions are established. Applicant has acknowledged his drug \ninvolvement. It is not clear whether he has disassociated from his drug-using associates \nor changed the environment where drugs were used, and he has not provided the signed \nstatement of intent. However, he has abstained from marijuana since 2014. \nThe first prong of AG \u00b6 26(a) (happened so long ago) focuses on whether the drug \ninvolvement was recent. There are no bright line rules for determining when conduct is \nrecent. The determination must be based on a careful evaluation of the totality of the \nevidence. If the evidence shows a significant period of time has passed without any \nevidence of misconduct, then an administrative judge must determine whether that period \nof time demonstrates changed circumstances or conduct sufficient to warrant a finding of \nreform or rehabilitation. ISCR Case No. 02-24452 at 6 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2004). Applicant\u2019s \nabstinence from marijuana has been for a \u201csignificant period of time,\u201d motivated by the \nrealization that marijuana use can jeopardize his security clearance and his job. I \nconclude that the security concerns raised by Applicant\u2019s drug involvement have been \nmitigated by the passage of time. \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \nThe SOR alleges that Applicant falsified his 2007 and 2017 SCAs by deliberately \nfailing to disclose his marijuana involvement. (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 3.a and 3.b). The security concern \nunder this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 15: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. . . .  \nApplicant\u2019s admissions and the evidence submitted at the hearing establish that \nhe deliberately did not disclose his marijuana involvement in either of his two SCAs, \nraising the following disqualifying condition: \nAG \u00b616(a): deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant \nfacts from any personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, \nor similar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment \nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine national security eligibility \nor trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities. \nThe following mitigating conditions are potentially relevant: \nAG \u00b6 17(a): the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; and \n11 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 17(c): the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior \nis so infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is unlikely \nto recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, trustworthiness, or \ngood judgment. \nAG \u00b6 17(a) is not established. Applicant did not correct either of his SCAs until he \nwas confronted with the evidence. \nAG \u00b6 17(c) is not established. Applicant falsified two SCAs, including his most \nrecent, on which this adjudication is based. Falsification of an SCA is not \u201cminor\u201d because \nit \u201cstrikes at the heart of the security clearance process.\u201d ISCR Case No. 09-01652 (App. \nBd. Aug. 8, 2011.) A deliberately false answer on a security clearance application is a \nfelony, punishable by a fine or imprisonment for not more than five years, or both. 18 U.S. \nC. \u00a71001. \nApplicant\u2019s falsification was not infrequent, but was part of a pattern of \nfalsifications. When Applicant was interviewed by a security investigator in September \n2018, he said that he had never been charged with an offense related to alcohol or drugs. \nWhen the investigator confronted him with the evidence, he admitted that he had been \ncharged with possession of marijuana. At the hearing, he testified that he could not \nremember why he did not disclose the marijuana charge in his 2007 SCA. When asked \nby the investigator why he did not disclose his marijuana involvement in his 2017 SCA, \nhe told the investigator that he did not disclose his marijuana use while holding a security \nclearance because it did not matter since he had stopped using marijuana. He also told \nthe investigator that he did not read the SCA carefully and thought he was required to \ndisclose marijuana use during the last seven or ten years. At the hearing, he admitted \nthat he did not disclose his marijuana involvement because he was afraid that it would \njeopardize his clearance and his job. (Tr. 32-33.) \nApplicant\u2019s false statement to a security investigator, which he later retracted after \nbeing confronted with the evidence, was not alleged in the SOR. His implausible and \ncontradictory explanations for his false statements also were not alleged in the SOR. \nHowever, conduct not alleged in the SOR may be considered to assess an applicant\u2019s \ncredibility; to decide whether a particular adjudicative guideline is applicable; to evaluate \nevidence of extenuation, mitigation, or changed circumstances; to consider whether an \napplicant has demonstrated successful rehabilitation; or as part of a whole-person \nanalysis. ISCR Case No. 03-20327 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, 2006) (citations omitted). \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-\nperson concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \n12 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ncircumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process \nfactors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nI have incorporated my comments under Guidelines J, H, and E in my whole-\nperson analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were addressed under those guidelines, \nbut some warrant additional comment. I have considered that Applicant has worked for a \ndefense contractor since October 2005 and held a security clearance since May 2007. \nThe birth of Applicant\u2019s daughter apparently was a significant event for him, and it caused \nhim to reconsider his previous lifestyle. \nApplicant offered considerable evidence in mitigation, but it is offset by his years \nof deceptive conduct. He used marijuana for many years while holding a security \nclearance, but he did not disclose his drug-related arrests to his employer. He lied about \nhis drug involvement in his February 2007 SCA and again in his February 2017 SCA. He \nlied to a security investigator in September 2018, until the investigator confronted him \nwith his arrest record. Even after admitting his drug involvement to the investigator, he \ngave inconsistent and implausible explanations for his false answers in his SCA. He \neventually admitted at the hearing that he did not disclose his drug involvement because \nhe was afraid it might jeopardize his clearance or his job. \n\u201cOnce a concern arises regarding an applicant\u2019s security clearance eligibility, there \nis a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance of a security clearance.\u201d ISCR \nCase No. 09-01652 at 3 (App. Bd. Aug. 8, 2011), citing Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F.2d \n1399, 1401 (9th  Cir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991). I am not convinced that \nApplicant has put his long record of concealment and deception behind him. After \nweighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under Guidelines J, H, and E and \nevaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has \nmitigated the security concerns raised by his criminal conduct and drug involvement, but \nhe has not mitigated the security concerns raised by his personal conduct. \nFormal Findings \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \nParagraph 1, Guideline J (Criminal Conduct): \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.f: \nFor Applicant \n13 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline H (Drugs): \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 3, Guideline E (Personal Conduct):  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 3.a and 3.b: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national security interests of the \nUnited States to continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nClearance is denied. \nLeRoy F.

Based on the results of the ensuing \nbackground investigation, adjudicators for the Department of Defense Consolidated \nAdjudications Facility (DOD CAF) could not determine, as required by Security Executive \nAgent Directive (SEAD) 4, Section E.4, and by DOD Directive 5220.6, as amended \n1 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(Directive), Section 4.2, that it is clearly consistent with the interests of national security \nto continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance. \nOn July 12, 2019, DOD CAF issued to Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) \nalleging facts that raise security concerns under the adjudicative guideline for financial \nconsiderations (Guideline F). The guideline cited in the SOR was part of the current set \nof adjudicative guidelines (AG) issued by the Director of National Intelligence on \nDecember 10, 2016, to be effective for all adjudications on or after June 8, 2017. \nApplicant timely responded to the SOR (Answer) and requested a hearing before \nan administrative judge from the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA). I first \nreceived the case on January 16, 2020, and scheduled a hearing for March 31, 2020. On \nMarch 20, 2020, I cancelled that hearing in response to pandemic-related restrictions \nimposed by the Secretary of Defense. On July 13, 2021, I rescheduled this case for \nhearing on August 19, 2021, via web-based video conferencing. The parties appeared as \nscheduled. Department Counsel proffered Government Exhibits (GX) 1 and 2. Applicant \ntestified and proffered Applicant Exhibits (AX) A \u2013 I. Additionally, I held the record open \nafter the hearing to allow Applicant to submit additional information. The record closed on \nSeptember 1, 2021, when I received Applicant\u2019s timely post-hearing submissions and \nDepartment Counsel\u2019s waiver of objection thereto. DOHA received a transcript of the \nhearing (Tr.) on August 27, 2021. \nApplicant\u2019s post-hearing submissions consisted of AX J (a two-page statement \nfrom Applicant); AX K (three one-page letters of recommendation); AX L (Applicant\u2019s four-\npage IRS transcript for the 2013 tax year); and AX M (Applicant\u2019s three-page IRS \ntranscript for the 2014 tax year). All exhibits were admitted without objection. \nOn November 18, 2021, I issued an unfavorable decision after concluding that \nApplicant had not met his burden of showing that it is clearly consistent with the interest \nof national security for him to be eligible for a security clearance. Applicant appealed that \ndecision and, on February 3, 2022, the DOHA Appeal Board remanded the case to me to \nissue a new decision consistent with the following findings of fact on appeal: \na.

(Answer) \nOn August 17, 2021, after receiving a pre-hearing copy of Applicant\u2019s proposed \nexhibits, Department Counsel moved to amend the SOR. SOR 1.b, as amended, alleged \nthat Applicant\u2019s failure to timely pay his federal income taxes occurred between 2013 and \n2018. SOR 1.c, as amended, alleged that Applicant owes $28,451.50 for unpaid taxes \nfrom the 2014 through 2018 tax years. Applicant denied SOR 1.b and 1.c, as amended. \nAfter reviewing the proposed exhibits and allowing the parties to be heard, I granted \nDepartment Counsel\u2019s motion and amended the SOR to conform to the evidence as \nprovided by Directive, Section E3.1.17. (Tr. 11 \u2013 18) In view of the foregoing pleadings \nand according to findings by the Appeal Board on remand, the following facts are \nestablished. \nApplicant is 55 years old. Since March 2003, he has worked for a defense \ncontractor as an information technology systems field engineer, a position that requires \neligibility for access to classified information for access to military facilities at home and \nabroad. Applicant has held a security clearance since at least March 2004. He also served \nin the Army on active duty between 1984 and 1993. Thereafter, he affiliated with the Army \nReserve until retiring in 2017. After leaving active duty, he earned an associate\u2019s degree \nin applied science and a bachelor\u2019s degree in technology management. He has been \nmarried since 1987 and has three children, one of whom is still his dependent. (GX 1; Tr. \n46 \u2013 48) \nBetween 2003 and 2017, Applicant was sent at least five times by his civilian \nemployer to work in direct support of U.S. military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, Kuwait, \nand Qatar. He disclosed in his 2018 e-QIP that he filed his federal and state income tax \nreturns late for the 2012, 2013, and 2017 tax years, and that he owed a total of $4,100 in \nunpaid taxes for those years. Information obtained by investigators and adjudicators \nduring the ensuing background investigation showed that Applicant did not file his federal \nincome tax returns on time for the 2013, 2016, and 2017 tax years. (Answer; GX 1; GX \n2; AX A \u2013 H; AX J; Tr. 48, 85 \u2013 86) \nInformation obtained during Applicant\u2019s background investigation shows that he \nowed $18,132.85 for unpaid taxes in the 2014 through 2016 tax years. At hearing, \nApplicant provided information showing that, as of December 9, 2020, he owed $28,451 \nfor unpaid taxes in the 2014 through 2018 tax years. The same information shows that, \nas of August 4, 2021, he owed $19,022 in unpaid taxes for the 2016, 2017, and 2018 tax \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nyears, the 2014 and 2015 tax year debts having been satisfied. In July 2015, Applicant \nentered into a repayment agreement with the IRS to make $151 monthly payments to \nresolve his tax debt. That repayment agreement subsequently has been renewed and \nadjusted to reflect either subsequent late filings or additional requests to pay through \ninstallments or both. His monthly payments were increased with each renewal, first to \n$191, then to $250. He now pays $350 each month. His tax debts also have been reduced \nthrough involuntary diversion of any tax refunds he was due after filing. (Answer; GX 2; \nAX A \u2013 J, AX L; Tr. 66 \u2013 78, 92) \nApplicant asserts that he was late in filing some of his federal and state returns \nstarting in 2013 because he found himself owing additional taxes as a result of increased \nincome from working overseas. He was not trying to avoid paying taxes but was confused \nabout how he should file his returns given his unexpected payment obligation even though \nhis 2013 filing requirements were no different than his filing requirements when he worked \noverseas the previous ten years. He also claims he did not know how to change his \nincome tax withholdings to avoid having to pay additional taxes after filing, and he has \nacknowledged that he did not properly manage his finances until recently. Nonetheless, \nas discussed above, after filing his 2013 returns, he started resolving his filing \ndiscrepancies and established a repayment plan. He also started using a private tax \npreparer who helped him file his returns for the 2018, 2019, and 2020 tax years. Applicant \nis now current on all of his tax reporting obligations, and his tax preparer has helped him \nadjust his income tax withholdings to a level appropriate for his income so that he is \nhaving sufficient tax withheld from his pay throughout the year. (Answer; GX 2; AX F; AX \nJ; AX L; Tr. 43 \u2013 44, 49 \u2013 52, 60 \u2013 66, 81, 85 \u2013 87) \nApplicant\u2019s current finances are otherwise sound. He has no other outstanding \ndebts, and he brings home in excess of $10,000 each month after taxes and other \ndeductions. He estimates that, after expenses, he has about $2,500 remaining each \nmonth, funds which he invests in a portfolio worth about $400,000. He acknowledged at \nhis hearing that he has the means with which to resolve his current tax debt. He prefers \nnot to do so, explaining that he is \u201ckind of okay with [paying the IRS] $370 a month.\u201d (Tr. \n53 \u2013 59, 94 \u2013 96) \nApplicant has an excellent reputation in the workplace and his community. \nAssociates who have known and worked with him for most of the past 25 years, and who \nare aware of his tax problems, praise Applicant for his honesty, integrity, trustworthiness, \nand professionalism. (AX K) \nPolicies \nEach security clearance decision must be a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndetermination based on examination of all available relevant and material information, \nand consideration of the pertinent criteria and adjudication policy in the adjudicative \nguidelines (AG). (See Directive, 6.3) Decisions must also reflect consideration of the \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nfactors listed in \u00b6 2(d) of the guidelines. Commonly referred to as the \u201cwhole-person\u201d \nconcept, those factors are:  \n(1) The nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nThe presence or absence of a disqualifying or mitigating condition is not \ndeterminative of a conclusion for or against an applicant. However, specific applicable \nguidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against them as they \nrepresent policy guidance governing the grant or denial of access to classified \ninformation. A security clearance decision is intended only to resolve whether it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest for an applicant to either receive or continue to have \naccess to classified information. (See Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518) \nThe Government bears the initial burden of producing admissible information on \nwhich it based the preliminary decision to deny or revoke a security clearance for an\napplicant. Additionally, the Government must be able to prove controverted facts alleged \nin the SOR. If the Government meets its burden, it then falls to the applicant to refute, \nextenuate or mitigate the Government\u2019s case. Because no one has a \u201cright\u201d to a security\nclearance, an applicant bears a heavy burden of persuasion. (See Egan, 484 U.S. at 528,\n531) A person who has access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship\nwith the Government based on trust and confidence. Thus, the Government has a\ncompelling interest in ensuring each applicant possesses the requisite judgment, \nreliability and trustworthiness of one who will protect the national interests as his or her \nown. The \u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d standard compels resolution of any \nreasonable doubt about an applicant\u2019s suitability for access in favor of the Government. \n(See Egan; AG \u00b6 2(b)) \n \n \n \n \n \nAnalysis \nFinancial Considerations  \nAvailable information in the form of IRS transcripts provided in response to DOD \nCAF interrogatories and in his hearing exhibits, shows Applicant did not file his federal \nincome tax returns on time for the 2013, 2016, and 2017. He has since brought his filing \nstatus current. Available information also shows that Applicant incurred a $28,451 debt \nfor federal taxes not timely paid with his returns for the tax years 2014 through 2018. He \nis now current on his tax reporting obligations; however, he still owes about $19,000 in \nunpaid taxes and is unwilling to resolve his tax debts more expeditiously outside of his \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nagreement with the IRS despite having the means to do so. This information reasonably \nraises a security concern about Applicant\u2019s finances that is articulated at AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nAs amended, the allegation at SOR 1.b is resolved for Applicant because it is \nsubsumed by the more informative allegation at SOR 1.c. The allegation at SOR 1.a also \nis resolved for Applicant because his filing deficiencies have been corrected, and it \nappears he remains current in his more recent tax filings. Nonetheless, as it pertains to \nSOR 1.c, as amended, available information requires application of the following AG \u00b6 19 \ndisqualifying conditions: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; \n(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so; \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired. \nBy contrast, Applicant\u2019s response to the Government\u2019s information requires \nconsideration of the following pertinent AG \u00b6 20 mitigating conditions: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority \nto file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \nAG \u00b6 20(a) does not apply because Applicant\u2019s tax debts are multiple and recent, \nin that they remain largely unpaid. AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(d) and 20(g) apply because Applicant began \nusing installments starting in 2015 to resolve his unpaid taxes. However, the benefit of \nthose mitigating conditions is attenuated by the fact that Applicant chooses not to use the \nresources he has at hand to more timely resolve his tax debts. At the current $370 monthly \nrate of repayment, his $19,000 remaining balance will take another 51 months to resolve. \nAG \u00b6 20(b) does not apply because Applicant did not show that his failure to pay \nhis taxes as required arose from circumstances beyond his control. Making more money \nusually means having to pay more taxes. Although he began repayment agreements with \nthe IRS in 2015, and he adjusted his tax withholdings in 2017, he has not acted to resolve \nhis tax debt consistent with the financial resources at his disposal. As of the close of the \nrecord, he still owed past-due taxes from five years earlier in 2016, yet despite having the \nmeans to resolve his tax debts almost immediately, his current intent is to make the IRS \nwait another four to five years for the rest of the taxes owed. His choice to continue \ninvesting his disposable income rather than prioritizing resolution of his tax debt weakens \nany claim that he acted responsibly in the face of any unforeseen circumstances. \nApplicant\u2019s stated reasons for not meeting his tax payment obligations were not plausible. \nEven if they were, they would not support a finding that his tax problems arose from \ncircumstances beyond his control. On balance, he has not mitigated the security concerns \nraised under Guideline F. \nI also have evaluated this record in the context of the whole-person factors listed \nin AG \u00b6 2(d). The favorable recommendations from Applicant\u2019s long-time friends and \nassociates are not sufficient to overcome the security concerns raised by his ongoing tax \ndebt. Those security concerns remain unresolved and sustain doubts about Applicant\u2019s \nsuitability for continued access to classified information. Because protection of the \ninterests of national security is the principal focus of these adjudications, those doubts \nmust be resolved against the Applicant\u2019s request for clearance. \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                        \n \n \n \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings on the allegations set forth in the SOR (as amended), as required \nby section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a and 1.b: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.c:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the foregoing, it is not clearly consistent with the interests of national \nsecurity for Applicant to have access to classified information.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Under Guideline F, the Government alleged that Applicant owed $51,262 for 11 delinquent or past-due debts (SOR 1.a \u2013 1.k). In response, Applicant admitted with explanations all of the allegations. (Answer) In addition to the facts established by Applicant\u2019s admissions, I make the following findings of relevant fact. Applicant is 47 years old. He enlisted in the United States Marine Corps in November 1995 and retired as a staff sergeant in December 2015. Thereafter, he worked for a federal contractor until August 2019. Between September 2019 and August 2020, he was unemployed except for two months, when he worked as a landscaper and at a retail store. He has worked for his current employer since September 2020. (GX 1; GX 3; Tr. 22 \u2013 26, 32) Applicant first received a security clearance after he entered on active duty in 1995. In March 2015, he submitted an e-QIP to renew that clearance. The ensuing background investigation produced information that supports all of the SOR allegations. The debts at issue became delinquent between 2014 and 2018. Only one debt (SOR 1.c) has been paid; however, that debt was for a delinquent military exchange system credit card that was resolved involuntarily when the creditor garnished the past-due amount from Applicant\u2019s retired pay.

I scheduled a hearing to be held \non June 29, 2022, via an online video-teleconferencing system. The parties appeared as \nscheduled, and Applicant testified in his own behalf. Department Counsel proffered \nGovernment Exhibits (GX) 1 \u2013 6. Additionally, a copy of the Government\u2019s list of exhibits \nand a discovery letter dated July 22, 2021, were included in the record as Hearing Exhibits \n(HX) 1 and 2, respectively. Applicant did not produce any documents at hearing. I \nreceived a transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on July 8, 2022. \nFindings of Fact \nUnder Guideline F, the Government alleged that Applicant owed $51,262 for 11 \ndelinquent or past-due debts (SOR 1.a \u2013 1.k). In response, Applicant admitted with \nexplanations all of the allegations. (Answer) In addition to the facts established by \nApplicant\u2019s admissions, I make the following findings of relevant fact. \nApplicant is 47 years old. He enlisted in the United States Marine Corps in \nNovember 1995 and retired as a staff sergeant in December 2015. Thereafter, he worked \nfor a federal contractor until August 2019. Between September 2019 and August 2020, \nhe was unemployed except for two months, when he worked as a landscaper and at a \nretail store. He has worked for his current employer since September 2020. (GX 1; GX 3; \nTr. 22 \u2013 26, 32) \nApplicant first received a security clearance after he entered on active duty in 1995. \nIn March 2015, he submitted an e-QIP to renew that clearance. The ensuing background \ninvestigation produced information that supports all of the SOR allegations. The debts at \nissue became delinquent between 2014 and 2018. Only one debt (SOR 1.c) has been \npaid; however, that debt was for a delinquent military exchange system credit card that \nwas resolved involuntarily when the creditor garnished the past-due amount from \nApplicant\u2019s retired pay. (GX 3 \u2013 6; Tr. 48) \nApplicant has been married three times. He and his current wife were married in \nJuly 2009 and have two minor children together. He attributes his financial problems to \nwhat he claims was his wife\u2019s financial malfeasance while he was deployed overseas \nbetween August 2010 and May 2011. He claims she abused a general power of attorney \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nhe gave her before he deployed. He avers she drained their bank accounts and ran up \nnumerous debts that went unpaid. She then took their (at the time only) child and moved \nto another state near her mother. Upon his return from deployment, Applicant reconciled \nwith his wife and she returned to their home near his duty station. Thereafter, they had \ntheir second child; however, they again separated in 2016. As of the hearing, neither had \nfiled for divorce, but Applicant has recently contacted a law firm to pursue filing. (Answer; \nAX 2; Tr. 26 \u2013 32, 57 \u2013 58) \nAside from SOR 1.c, discussed above, Applicant has not paid or otherwise \nresolved any of the delinquent debts attributed to him in the Government\u2019s exhibits. In his \nMarch 2021 response to the SOR, he indicated his expectation that the debts at SOR 1.a, \n1.b, 1.f, 1.h, and 1.i would fall off his credit report after seven years because they have \nbeen charged off as business losses. As to SOR 1.j and 1.k, he stated his intention to \nresolve those debts by May 2021, but acknowledged at hearing that he had not yet paid \nthem. He further stated that the SOR 1.g debt, the remainder after resale of a car \nrepossession, was the responsibility of his estranged wife. Although it appears in one of \nhis credit reports as a joint account, he did not present any information to support his \nclaim. (Answer; Tr. 35 \u2013 41) \nFinally, he thought he had paid the medical bills alleged at SOR 1.d and 1.e, but \nhe has no proof of that claim. According to a 2020 credit report, those debts were first \nreported as delinquent in 2018. They do not appear on a 2021 credit report. Absent \nadditional information from the Applicant, the status of these debts is unclear in this \nrecord. (GX 4 \u2013 6; Tr. 41) \nApplicant testified that he does not intend to pay for any debts that he feels are his \nwife\u2019s responsibility. SOR 1.a is the only debt listed as a joint account. He did not provide \nany information that shows she is responsible for any of the debts in the SOR. As of the \nhearing, he planned to list all of his debts in a petition for divorce (not yet filed) so that \nresponsibility for the debts could be shared with his wife. (GX 5; Tr. 49 \u2013 51) \nIn addition to the income Applicant receives for his work as a defense contractor, \nhe receives disability pay from the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) and his retired \nmilitary pay. Most of his retired pay is allocated to his wife for the support of their children. \nAfter paying his regular monthly expenses, he has as much as $3,000 remaining each \nmonth. He does not use that money to pay off any of his past-due debts, choosing instead \nto spend his extra money on other things. (Tr. 34, 42 \u2013 45, 54 \u2013 55) \nPolicies \nEach security clearance decision must be a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndetermination based on examination of all available relevant and material information, \nand consideration of the pertinent criteria and adjudication policy in the adjudicative \nguidelines (AG). (See Directive, 6.3) Decisions must also reflect consideration of the \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \nfactors listed in \u00b6 2(d) of the guidelines. Commonly referred to as the \u201cwhole-person\u201d \nconcept, those factors are: \n(1) The nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nThe presence or absence of a disqualifying or mitigating condition is not \ndeterminative of a conclusion for or against an applicant. However, specific applicable \nguidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against them as they \nrepresent policy guidance governing the grant or denial of access to classified \ninformation. A security clearance decision is intended only to resolve whether it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest for an applicant to either receive or continue to have \naccess to classified information. (See Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518) \nThe Government bears the initial burden of producing admissible information on \nwhich it based the preliminary decision to deny or revoke a security clearance for an \napplicant. Additionally, the Government must be able to prove controverted facts alleged \nin the SOR. If the Government meets its burden, it then falls to the applicant to refute, \nextenuate or mitigate the Government\u2019s case. Because no one has a \u201cright\u201d to a security \nclearance, an applicant bears a heavy burden of persuasion. (See Egan, 484 U.S. at 528, \n531) A person who has access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship \nwith the Government based on trust and confidence. Thus, the Government has a \ncompelling interest in ensuring each applicant possesses the requisite judgment, \nreliability and trustworthiness of one who will protect the national interests as his or her \nown. The \u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d standard compels resolution of any \nreasonable doubt about an applicant\u2019s suitability for access in favor of the Government. \n(See Egan; AG \u00b6 2(b)) \nAnalysis \nFinancial Considerations  \nThe Government met its burden of producing sufficient, reliable information to \nsupport all of the SOR allegations that Applicant accrued significant past-due or \ndelinquent debt that, with one exception, is still outstanding. Available information shows \nthat he has not acted to pay or otherwise resolve any of the debts listed in the SOR \ndespite having significant positive cash flow each month since starting his current \nemployment in September 2020. This information reasonably raises a security concern \nabout Applicant\u2019s finances that is articulated at AG \u00b6 18: \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nMore specifically, available information requires application of the following AG \u00b6 \n19 disqualifying conditions: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts;  \n(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nAvailable information also requires consideration of the following pertinent AG \u00b6 \n20 mitigating conditions: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue. \nAfter a thorough review of this record, I conclude that none of these mitigating \nconditions can be applied. In response to the Government\u2019s prima facie case for \ndisqualification, Applicant showed that only the debt at SOR 1.c has been addressed. In \nthat instance, payment was made only through involuntary garnishment of funds from his \nmilitary retired pay. All of the remaining debts listed in the SOR are still unresolved. \nAccordingly, his financial problems are recent and continuing. \nIt may be that Applicant\u2019s financial problems arose through the unexpected \ncircumstance of his wife\u2019s financial malfeasance; however, the record does not support a \nconclusion that he acted responsibly given those circumstances. While he claims many \nof the debts at issue were wrongly incurred by his wife, he offered no proof of that claim. \nHe further asserted that he will include the debts in a divorce petition he has yet to file \nafter six years of separation. \nFinally, there has been no good-faith effort to pay here. Applicant has referenced \nthe fact that many of his debts are no longer at issue because they have \u201caged off\u201d his \ncredit history. That may be true; however, it generally does not reflect well on a person\u2019s \nreliability if they seek to avoid paying their debts by waiting for a technicality to take effect. \nIn this case, Applicant has relied on the age of several of his debts as a means to resolve \nthem. His lack of action on any of his debts, despite having the means to resolve several \nof them over at least the past two years, shows that he has not taken his responsibilities \nseriously in this regard and that his financial problems are likely to persist. \nApplicant has not sought any professional financial assistance in addressing his \nfinancial problems. Further, he did not present any information that shows he manages \nhis personal finances in a way that would help him avoid such financial problems in the \nfuture. On balance, I conclude Applicant has not met his burden of persuasion and that \nhe has not mitigated the security concerns established by the Government\u2019s information. \nI also have considered the potential application of AG \u00b6 20(e). The record evidence \nas a whole sustains the significant doubts about Applicant\u2019s suitability for access to \nclassified information that have been raised by the Government\u2019s information. Because \nprotection of the national interest is the principal focus of these adjudications, those \ndoubts must be resolved against the Applicant. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                        \n \n \n \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required by section \nE3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a, 1.b, 1.d \u2013 1.k: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.c: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the foregoing, it is not clearly consistent with the interests of national \nsecurity for Applicant to have access to classified information.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant is 46 years old and divorced with one child. He has an associate\u2019s degree. Applicant has been employed by a defense contractor since 2015 and seeks to obtain national security eligibility and a security clearance in connection with his employment. (Item 2 at Sections 12, 13A, and 17; Item 3.) Paragraph 1 (Guideline F, Financial Considerations) The Government alleges in this paragraph that Applicant is ineligible for clearance because he is financially overextended and therefore potentially unreliable, untrustworthy, or at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. The SOR alleged that Applicant had eight past-due debts, including tax debts and mortgage foreclosures, totaling approximately $202,650. Applicant denied allegations 1.f and 1.h. The existence and amounts of these debts is supported by credit reports dated October 29, 2015; April 9, 2019; and March 16, 2021. (Items 7, 8, and 9.) Applicant stated that most of his financial problems were connected to his divorce in 2013. (Answer; Item 3; Applicant Exhibit A.) The current status of the allegations in the SOR is as follows: 1.a. Applicant admitted that he owed the Federal Government through the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) $20,405 for unpaid taxes. Applicant and his wife were divorced in 2013. As part of the divorce agreement Applicant was required to liquidate an IRA and pay his ex-wife half. He provided $18,000 to his ex-wife and used other monies for personal expenses. Th",

Applicant stated \nthat most of his financial problems were connected to his divorce in 2013. (Answer; Item \n3; Applicant Exhibit A.) \nThe current status of the allegations in the SOR is as follows: \n1.a. Applicant admitted that he owed the Federal Government through the Internal \nRevenue Service (IRS) $20,405 for unpaid taxes. Applicant and his wife were divorced in \n2013. As part of the divorce agreement Applicant was required to liquidate an IRA and \npay his ex-wife half. He provided $18,000 to his ex-wife and used other monies for \npersonal expenses. The debt consists primarily of taxes and penalties for early withdrawal \nfrom the IRA.

The last one, dated April 15, 2021, is for $200. \nApplicant had not received notification from the IRS that they have accepted his proposal \nas of the date of Applicant Exhibit A. Applicant is making a good-faith effort to resolve this \ndebt. (Item 3 at 2, 7-9, 22; Item 10 at 16-17; Applicant Exhibit A at 2-4, 23-27.) \n1.b. Applicant admitted that he had a mortgage foreclosed on in 2014 in the amount \nof $136,500. Applicant bought the subject house with his then-wife. After the divorce he \ncould not maintain the payments on one salary and attempted to refinance or sell the \nproperty. He was unsuccessful and lost the house in foreclosure. (Item 3 at 10-11, \nApplicant Exhibit A at 3-4.) \n1.c. Applicant admitted that he had a second mortgage charged off in \napproximately 2014 in the amount of $34,743. This was in relation to the first mortgage \ndiscussed in 1.b, above. Applicant stated that his ex-wife refused to help pay any debt. \nHe stated in his Answer, \u201cI was financially uncapable (sic) of paying on my own salary. I \ndid have lawyers fees and child support that were present at the time as well.\u201d (Item 3 at \n10-11; Applicant Exhibit A at 3-4.) \n1.d. Applicant admitted owing a charged-off credit card debt in the amount of \n$9,652. This credit card debt arose during his marriage. He stated in his Answer that he \nis amenable to paying this debt, but there is no evidence that he has entered into any \npayment arrangement with this creditor. This debt is not resolved. \n1.e. Applicant admitted that he owed a charged-off commercial debt in the amount \nof $1,032. This credit card debt arose during his marriage. He stated in his Answer that \nhis ex-wife was responsible for the debt, but she refused to pay it. He is amenable to \npaying this debt, but there is no evidence that he has entered into any payment \narrangement with this creditor. This debt is not resolved. \n1.f. Applicant denied owing a charged-off credit card debt in the amount of $471. \nHe stated in his Answer that he paid this debt. This debt does not appear in the most \nrecent credit report in the record, dated March 16, 2021. (Item 9.) Based on the available \ninformation, I cannot find that Applicant currently owes this debt. This allegation is found \nfor Applicant. \n1.g. Applicant admitted that he owed a charged-off wireless telephone debt in the \namount of $207. This debt arose during his marriage. He stated in his Answer that his ex-\nwife was responsible for the debt, but she refuses to pay it. He is amenable to paying this \ndebt, but there is no evidence that he has entered into any payment arrangement with \nthis creditor.

Applicant denied that he had a foreclosure in about July 2016. Applicant stated \nthat the person involved in this foreclosure is his father, who has the same name but a \ndifferent Social Security number. Documentation in the record confirms that the property \ninvolved in this foreclosure actually belonged to Applicant\u2019s father and his wife. (Item 11; \nItem 12; Applicant Exhibit A at 6-7.) This allegation is found for Applicant because the \ndebt is not his. \nThree credit reports were submitted by the Government (Items 7, 8, and 9). The \ncredit reports show that Applicant\u2019s financial condition is good other than the debts in the \nSOR. Applicant has stated that he is current with his payments to the IRS and his child \nsupport. (Applicant Exhibit A at 3-4.) His tax return documentation shows that his salary \nhas been steadily increasing over the years he has been employed with his current \nemployer. (Item 10.) \nParagraph 2 (Guideline J, Criminal Conduct) \nThe Government alleges in this paragraph that Applicant is ineligible for clearance \nbecause he has engaged in criminal conduct that creates doubt about a person\u2019s \njudgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. Applicant admitted both allegations under this \nparagraph. \n \n2.a. Applicant was arrested in March 2014 and charged with seven offenses \nrelated to his driving under the influence of alcohol. He plead guilty to Driving Under the \nInfluence of Liquor/Drugs/Vapors and was sentenced to five days\u2019 confinement, \nunsupervised probation for one year, fined $2,300, and required to attend alcohol \nawareness classes. Applicant submitted evidence showing that he had completely paid \nhis fine and successfully completed the classes for this offense. Applicant was fired from \nhis job with his state\u2019s Department of Corrections due to this arrest and conviction. (Item \n3 at 13-14, 21; Item 5; Applicant Exhibit A at 4, 12, 13, 15, 18, 20, and 21.) \n \n2.b. Applicant was arrested in July 2016 and charged with four offenses related to \nhis driving under the influence of alcohol. He plead guilty to Driving Under the Influence \nof Liquor/Drugs/Vapors and was sentenced to confinement for one day, 90 days of home \nconfinement, unsupervised probation for two years, fined $3,475, 30 hours of community \nservice, and required to attend 24 sessions of substance abuse treatment. Applicant \nsubmitted evidence showing that he had completely paid his fine, and successfully \ncompleted the required treatment sessions for this offense as well as his community \nservice. (Item 3 at 19-20, 28; Item 6; Applicant Exhibit A at 5, 11, 14, 16, 17, and 19.) \nParagraph 3 (Guideline G, Alcohol Consumption) \nThe Government alleges in this paragraph that Applicant is ineligible for clearance \nbecause he consumes intoxicants to excess. Subparagraph 3.a stated that the \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ninformation set forth under subparagraphs 2.a and 2.b, above, are also cognizable under \nthis paragraph. Applicant denied the single allegation under this guideline. \nApplicant admitted the facts of the two alcohol-related arrests described under \nParagraph 2. He has consistently stated that he has not drunk alcohol since his last arrest \nin July 2016, a period of more than five years. In addition to the court-ordered counseling \nin regard to his two DUI arrests, he has also obtained counseling through his employer\u2019s \nemployee assistance program. That counselor submitted a letter to Applicant\u2019s attorney \non September 9, 2016. He stated that Applicant \u201chas never denied his alcohol use and \ncomes with a positive attitude.\u201d The counselor also stated, \u201cHe [Applicant] has made \nexcellent progress in acquiring personal insights and better ways to cope with stress in \nhis life.\u201d (Item 3 at 4-6, 9, 14; Applicant Exhibit A at 9.) \n Paragraph 4 (Guideline E, Personal Conduct) \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe Government alleges in this paragraph that Applicant is ineligible for clearance \nbecause he has falsified material facts during the clearance screening process. Applicant \ndenied both allegations under this paragraph. \nIn January 1991, when Applicant was 15 years old, he was charged with \nconspiracy to transport marijuana. He got involved in a conspiracy with two other juveniles \nand one adult. Applicant was charged because he did not inform police of the plot. He \nplead guilty as a juvenile and received one-year probation, which he successfully \ncompleted. The record is silent as to whether this conviction occurred in Federal or state \ncourt. The only evidence as to the existence of this conviction is that provided by Applicant \nin his interview and written statements. (Item 3 at 20-21.) \nApplicant did not admit this arrest and conviction on his September 2015 e-QIP \n(SOR 4.a) or when questioned by an authorized investigator of the Department of \nDefense in June 2017 (SOR 4.b). He only discussed the conspiracy charge with the \ninvestigator in 2017 after an initial denial. \n \n \nIn his Answer Applicant said with regard to allegation 4.a, \u201cI believe I\nmisunderstood if i had to mention anything about charges as a minor or under the age of\n18. My intention was never to hide anything.\u201d \n \nApplicant discussed his interview answers as follows in his Answer, \u201cI did not know \nI had to discuss juvenile record because the application did not say charges of a juvenile \nor under the age of 18.\u201d \nApplicant further explained his reasoning in Applicant Exhibit A: \nI want to clarify I did not try to omit any information about my juvenile record. \nI was misinformed about my juvenile record.

(Applicant Exhibit A at 5.) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for national security eligibility, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines (AG) list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. The entire \nprocess is a conscientious scrutiny of applicable guidelines in the context of a number of \nvariables known as the whole-person concept. The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires, \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. I have not drawn inferences based on mere speculation or \nconjecture. \n \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.14, requires the Government to present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, \u201cThe applicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d  \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants national \nsecurity eligibility. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the \napplicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as \nto potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified or sensitive information. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFinally, as emphasized in Section 7 of Executive Order 10865, \u201cAny determination under \nthis order adverse to an applicant shall be a determination in terms of the national interest \nand shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d \nSee also Executive Order 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information.) \nAnalysis \nParagraph 1 (Guideline F, Financial Considerations) \nThe security concerns relating to the guideline for financial considerations are set \nout in AG \u00b6 18, which reads in pertinent part: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personal security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAG \u00b6 19 describes three conditions that could raise security concerns and may be \ndisqualifying in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired. \nApplicant had two mortgages foreclosed upon in approximately 2014. He owed \napproximately $24,500 to the IRS for back taxes and penalties. In addition, he owed three \nother creditors approximately $10,891 for past-due debts as of the date the SOR was \nissued. These facts establish prima facie support for the foregoing disqualifying \nconditions, and shift the burden to Applicant to mitigate those concerns. \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe guideline includes four conditions in AG \u00b6 20 that could mitigate the security \nconcerns arising from Applicant\u2019s alleged financial difficulties: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond\nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn,\nunexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation, clear\nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the\nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n \n \n \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority \nto file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \nAll the debts alleged in the SOR, including the tax debt, were related to Applicant\u2019s \ndivorce from his wife in 2013. He could not afford to pay the mortgages on his salary, so \nthe house went into foreclosure. He had to liquidate a retirement account, with the \nsubsequent tax debt, and the consumer debts arose during the marriage. Considering \nthose basic facts, we turn to the question of whether Applicant has acted responsibly in \nresolving the debts, even though he has not paid any of the consumer debts as of yet. I \nfind that he has. Applicant has been paying the IRS $285 a month for well over a year, \nan amount of over $4,000. He also has consistently been making his child-support \npayments. The credit reports show no new past-due indebtedness. His tax returns show \na steadily increasing salary, which will allow him to continue to pay the IRS, his child \nsupport obligation, and resolve the consumer debts in a responsible fashion. All four of \nthe mitigating conditions have application in this case.   \nIn support of these findings, I cite the Appeal Board\u2019s decision in ISCR Case No. \n07-06482 at 3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008) for the proposition that the adjudicative guidelines \ndo not require that an applicant be debt-free. The Board\u2019s guidance for adjudications in \ncases such as this is the following: \n. . . an applicant is not required, as a matter of law, to establish that he has \npaid off each and every debt listed in the SOR. All that is required is that an \napplicant demonstrate that he has established a plan to resolve his financial \nproblems and taken significant actions to implement that plan. The Judge \ncan reasonably consider the entirety of an applicant\u2019s financial situation and \nhis actions in evaluating the extent to which that applicant\u2019s plan for the \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nreduction of his outstanding indebtedness is credible and realistic. There is \nno requirement that a plan provide for payments on all outstanding debts \nsimultaneously. Rather, a reasonable plan (and concomitant conduct) may \nprovide for the payments of such debts one at a time. ISCR Case No. 07-\n06482 at 3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008) (internal citations and quotation marks\nomitted).  \n \nGiven his resources, Applicant has initiated a pragmatic approach to the \nrepayment of his IRS debt and has taken significant steps to resolve that debt. Applicant \nhas the knowledge and ability that will allow him to resolve his other debts and stay on a \nproper financial footing. He has fully mitigated all the allegations in the SOR. Paragraph \n1 is found for Applicant. \nParagraph 2 (Guideline J, Criminal Conduct) \nThe security concerns relating to the guideline for criminal conduct are set out in \nAG \u00b6 30, which states: \nCriminal activity creates doubt about a person\u2019s judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person\u2019s ability or \nwillingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations. \nAG \u00b6 31 describes two conditions that could raise security concerns and may be \ndisqualifying in this case: \n(a) a pattern of minor offenses, any one of which on its own would be \nunlikely to affect a national security eligibility decision, but which in \ncombination cast doubt on the individual's judgment, reliability, or \ntrustworthiness; and \n(b) evidence (including, but not limited to, a credible allegation, an \nadmission, and matters of official record) of criminal conduct, regardless of \nwhether the individual was formally charged, prosecuted, or convicted. \nApplicant had two alcohol-related arrests in convictions in 2014 and 2016. Both of \nthe above disqualifying conditions have application in this case. \nThe guideline includes four conditions in AG \u00b6 32 that could mitigate the security \nconcerns arising from Applicant\u2019s alleged criminal conduct. Two have possible application \nto the facts of this case: \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur and \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s last arrest occurred in 2016, five years ago. There is no evidence of \nany further criminal conduct. He submitted considerable documentary evidence showing \nthat he attended all required classes and treatment sessions.

In addition to court-ordered education and treatment, he used \nhis company\u2019s employee assistance program to obtain additional counseling about \nalcohol and how to avoid such incidents in the future. The conduct is unlikely to \nrecur given what he has learned and the resources he has available. Applicant has \nmitigated this security concern in full and Paragraph 3 is found for him. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nParagraph 4 (Guideline E, Personal Conduct) \nThe security concerns relating to the guideline for personal conduct are set out in \nAG \u00b6 15, which states: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. \nAG \u00b6 16 describes two conditions that could raise security concerns and may be \ndisqualifying in this case: \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar \nform used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, \naward benefits or status, determine national security eligibility or \ntrustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities; and \n(b) deliberately providing false or misleading information, or concealing or \nomitting information, concerning relevant facts to an employer, investigator, \nsecurity official, competent medical or mental health professional involved \nin or making a recommendation relevant to a national security eligibility \ndetermination, or other official government representative. \nApplicant was arrested and subsequently convicted of conspiracy to transport \nmarijuana when he was a juvenile. He did not report these facts on his e-QIP or when \noriginally interviewed by a government investigator. The above disqualifying condition has \napplication to this case. \nThe guideline includes three conditions in AG \u00b6 17 that could mitigate the security \nconcerns arising from Applicant\u2019s alleged falsification: \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; \n11 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(b) the refusal or failure to cooperate, omission, or concealment was caused \nor significantly contributed to by advice of legal counsel or of a person with \nprofessional responsibilities for advising or instructing the individual \nspecifically concerning security processes. Upon being made aware of the \nrequirement to cooperate or provide the information, the individual \ncooperated fully and truthfully; and \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment. \nApplicant was told by his lawyers in 1991 that his drug case would be expunged \nwhen he turned 18. After being informed by the investigator of the need to discuss the \noffense Applicant cooperated. With regard to the e-QIP it is clear that Applicant looked \nfor an instruction saying he had to report juvenile offenses. He did not find it. Applicant\u2019s \nbelief that he did not have to report the arrest, while erroneous, was not an attempt to \nconceal the arrest. Given that Applicant was otherwise truthful regarding more current \ncriminal offenses I find that he did not have the requisite intent to deceive when he filled \nout the e-QIP or originally denied the offense to the investigator. Paragraph 4 is found for \nApplicant. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for national security eligibility by considering the totality of the \napplicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should \nconsider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant national security \neligibility for a security clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon \ncareful consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \npertinent facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant has mitigated the \n12 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                \n \n \n \n \n \n \nconcerns regarding his financial situation, past alcohol use and related criminal conduct, \nand his alleged falsification. He has minimized the potential for pressure, coercion, or \nduress, as well as the likelihood of recurrence. Overall, the record evidence does not \ncreate substantial doubt as to Applicant\u2019s present suitability for national security eligibility \nand a security clearance. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a through 1.h: \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline J: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 2.a and 2.b: \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 3: Guideline G:  \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 3.a:  \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 4: Guideline E:  \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 4.a and 4.b: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s national security \neligibility for a security clearance.

The case was assigned to me on October 21, 2021. The \nhearing was initially postponed and rescheduled because of Applicant\u2019s illness. It was \nheld on February 16, 2022. On the same day, I proposed that this case was appropriate \nfor a summary disposition in Applicant\u2019s favor. Department Counsel did not object. \nThis case involves a single allegation of a delinquent debt (repossessed car) \nunder Guideline F. The debt resulted from Applicant's ex-wife not living up to her \ndivorce settlement obligation to make the car payments while she maintained \npossession of the car. Applicant was the primary obligor on the debt when his ex-wife \n1 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nfailed to make four months of car payments. Thus, he was responsible for the debt \nwhen the car was repossessed. Applicant made payments toward the residual debt \nafter the car was sold at auction. However, since then the creditor \"wrote off\" the debt \nand is sending Applicant an IRS 1099-C, cancellation of debt notice. Applicant \nunderstands he will have to claim the written-off debt amount as income and he is \nprepared to do so. All his other finances are in order. \nThe concerns over Applicant\u2019s history of financial problems do not create doubts \nabout his current reliability, trustworthiness, good judgment, and ability to protect \nclassified information. In reaching this conclusion, I weighed the evidence as a whole \nand considered if the favorable evidence outweighed the unfavorable evidence. I also \ngave due consideration to the whole-person concept. Accordingly, I conclude that he \nmet his ultimate burden of persuasion to show that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant him eligibility for access to classified information.

Administrative Judge \nBased upon a review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, \nApplicant did not mitigate foreign influence and personal conduct concerns. Eligibility for \naccess to classified information or to hold a sensitive position is denied. \nStatement of the Case \nOn November 22, 2019, the Department of Defense (DoD) Consolidated Central \nAdjudications Facility (CAF) issued a statement of reasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing \nreasons why under the foreign influence and personal conduct guidelines the DoD could \nnot make the preliminary affirmative determination of eligibility for granting a security \nclearance, and recommended referral to an administrative judge to determine whether a \nsecurity clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked.

Allegedly, his spouse\u2019s brother currently serves as a \nColonel in the Iraq military. \nUnder Guideline E, Applicant allegedly resigned from his employment with his \nprior employer in April 2016 when it was discovered that he had lied on his employment \napplication by claiming to have a degree in computer science, when in fact he holds a \ndegree in English Literature. Allegedly while visiting Iraq with his spouse and family in \nJune 2012, he stole his wife\u2019s and children\u2019s passports in an attempt to prevent their \nreturn to the United States. \nIn his response to the SOR, Applicant admitted most of the allegations with \nexplanations. He claimed to have very limited communications with members of his own \nfamily and virtually no communications with his sister\u2019s family since 2006 and denied \nhaving any relationship with his spouse\u2019s brother. And, for these reasons, he denied \nhaving any knowledge of his spouse\u2019s brother\u2019s whereabouts. \n2 \n\n \n \n                                                                                                                                              \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAddressing the Government\u2019s personal conduct concerns, Applicant claimed his \nfalse claim of holding a bachelor\u2019s degree in computer engineering, for which he was \nforced to resign in lieu of termination, was an isolated incident that occurred over eight \nyears ago. He claimed to have voluntarily disclosed this information to the investigator \nwho interviewed him. He claimed that he does not use the computer degree anymore in \nany of his job applications, or in trying to get a job with the engineering degree. He \nfurther claimed that he destroyed any copy of this degree in his possession. And, he \nclaimed in his response that he \u201cwill not be able to use it in the future, for moral purpose \nand self-discipline.\u201d \nIn responding to the SOR allegations he stole the passports of his wife and \nchildren during their visit to Iraq in 2012, Applicant denied stealing his family\u2019s U.S. \npassports. He claimed to have a parental right to appropriate both of his children\u2019s \npassports, while visiting Iraq in 2012. While claiming, that there were too many factors \ninvolved in the incident to fully explain the circumstances involved in short time or in any \nshort written statement, he went on to claim his wife had no court order granting her \ncustody over the children, and as head of his household he had the legal as well as the \npersonal right to keep his kids\u2019 documents with him. And, he claimed that his children \nare safe in the United States and living the American dream with his wife and himself. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant is a 51-year-old civilian linguist employed by a defense contractor who \nseeks a security clearance. Allegations covered in the SOR and admitted by Applicant \nare incorporated and adopted as relevant and material findings. Additional findings \nfollow. \nBackground \nApplicant married in June 2004 and has three children from this marriage (ages \n15 and 14). (GEs 1-2; Tr. 36-37) He earned a high school diploma in Iraq in July 1988 \nand a bachelor\u2019s degree in English literature in Iraq in September 1992. (GEs 1-2; Tr. \n36) \nApplicant immigrated to the United States in May 2008 and became a naturalized \nU.S. citizen in June 2013. (GEs 1-3; Tr. 37-39). Applicant reported no U.S. military \nservice.  \nBefore immigrating to the United States, Applicant served two years of \ncompulsory military service in Iraq (April 1994-August 1995). (GE 1; Tr. 36) Between \n2003 and 2008, Applicant served in Iraq\u2019s special coalition forces. (GEs 1-3 and AEs A-\nB)  \nApplicant\u2019s wife was born in Iraq and immigrated with him to the United States in \nMay 2008. (GEs 1-2) Applicant\u2019s wife became a naturalized U.S. citizen in 2013 and \nremains a dual citizen of Iraq and the United States.

(GEs 1-2) He has continued to supplement his current employment with other \nself-employment jobs. (GE 2) Previously, he worked for himself and other employers in \nvarious types of telecommunication jobs. (Tr. 39-40) Applicant is sponsored by his \ncurrent employer for a security clearance. (GE 1; Tr. 75) \nWhile employed by a private employer between 2015 and 2016, Applicant was \nforced to resign by his employer for falsifying his employment application. With the help \nof his brother, who provided a fake transcript and diploma, Applicant falsely claimed to \nhave a degree in computer engineering. (GE 2; Tr. 42-44) Applicant attributed his false \nclaim of holding a degree in computer engineering to his belief that an engineering \ndegree would enhance his ability to get the job he applied for. (GE 2; Tr. 45-46, 66-68) \nAlthough, Applicant has not to date submitted any other employment application \nclaiming an engineering degree (in lieu of the degree in English Literature he actually \npossesses), he has continued to include the engineering degree reference in his profile \non his own LinkedIn website. (GE 4; Tr. 46-48, 68-69) \nApplicant\u2019s family members \nApplicant has a number of family members who are citizens and residents of \nIraq. (GEs 1-2) While his father is deceased, his mother is a citizen and resident of Iraq. \n(GEs 1-3; Tr. 55) He also has four sisters and two brothers who are citizens and \nresidents of Iraq. Both his mother-in-law and father-in-law are deceased. (GEs 1-2) \nHowever, he has a brother-in-law who is both a citizen and resident of Iraq and is a \ngeneral in the Baghdad protection forces. (GEs 1-2; Tr. 60) \nApplicant maintains frequent contact with his mother (twice weekly by phone or \ninternet application). (GE 2; Tr. 55-56) His contacts with his sisters range between by-\nweekly communications (with two of his sisters) to bi-monthly contacts with his two other \nsisters and two brothers residing in Iraq. (GE 2; Tr. 62) He maintains no contact with his \nbrother-in-law. While unsure exactly how often his wife kept in touch with the brother-in-\nlaw, he estimated monthly or bi-monthly contacts. (Tr. 60-61) None of Applicant\u2019s \nimmediate family members residing in Iraq have any known associations or ties to the \nIraqi military of government. \nDuring a visit to Iraq with his wife and children in June 2012, Applicant took \npossession of their passports before leaving Iraq without his wife and children. (GE 2) \nHis given reason for withholding their passports was to prevent their return to the United \nStates. (GE 2; Tr. 50-51) Six months later (in December 2012), with the help of a local \nU.S. police department, his wife was able to obtain a visa and make a safe return to the \nUnited States (GE 2; Tr. 50-52) Upon retrieving the U.S. passports of herself and her \nchildren, she returned to Iraq to gather her children and return them to the United \nStates.

(Tr. 64) Applicant assured he has no interest in \nreturning to Iraq. \nIraq\u2019s country status \nThe Republic of Iraq is a constitutional parliamentary republic. The 2018 \nparliamentary elections generally satisfied international standards of free and fair \nelections and produced a peaceful transition of power from Prime Minister Haider al-\nAbadi to Adil Abd al-Mahdi. Widespread protests that began in October 2029 \ncontributed to the resignation of al-Mahdi on December 1, 2019, and triggered a five-\nmonth period of government formation. \nMustafa al-Kadhimi (acting director of the Iraqi National Intelligence Service) \nreceived confirmation as prime minister by the Iraqi Council of Representatives on May \n6, 2020 after committing to holding early elections in 2021, provide judicial \naccountability for violence during the previous year\u2019s protests, bring all arms under state \ncontrol, and address systemic and widespread corruption within Iraqi institutions. See \nRequest for Administrative Notice, Republic of Iraq; 2020 Country Reports on Human \nRights Practices for 2020: Iraq, U.S. Dept. of State (March 2021) \nThe U.S. State Department\u2019s travel advisory for Iraq is set at Level 4 and \ncautions U.S. citizens not to travel to Iraq due to Covid-19, terrorism, kidnapping, armed \nconflict, and the Mission\u2019s limited capacity to provide support to U.S. citizens. \nAccording to the Travel Advisory, U.S. citizens in Iraq are considered to be at high risk \nfor violence and kidnapping. Numerous terrorist groups are active in Iraq and regularly \nattack both Iraqi security forces and civilians. Anti-U.S. sectarian militias threaten U.S. \ncitizens and Western companies throughout Iraq. Attacks by improvised explosive \ndevices (IEDs) occur in many areas of the country (inclusive of Baghdad).  See Iraq \nTravel Advisory, supra.  \nTerrorist activity in Iraq \nTerrorism continues to be a major problem for Iraq. Beginning in early 2019, and \nlast through mid-2020, the country experienced large-scale protests in Baghdad and \nseveral Shia-majority provinces, with reports of more than 500 civilians killed and \n20,000 or more injured. Reports confirm that the Iraqi government took minimal steps to \nbring to justice those responsible for the violence.

State Department reports confirm that between 2019 and 2021, \nattacks by militant terrorist groups operating in Iraq and counterattacks by U.S. military \nforces continued virtually unabated. \nDespite improved government control over ISIS and other terrorist groups in Iraq, \nISIS has continued to mount terrorist operations (albeit on a smaller scale), particularly \nin the North and West of the country, especially in rural areas where Iraqi security \nforces maintain a limited presence. See Country Reports on Terrorism 2020 at 120, \nsupra. In 2020, terrorists conducted more than 100 IED (improvised explosive devices) \nattacks on Defeat-ISIS-contracted convoys and launched at least 40 indirect fire attacks \nagainst U.S. interests in Iraq.

While \nterrorist attacks in Iraq have continued to decline, they have not completely subsided. \nForeign and indigenous terrorist groups remain capable of conducting deadly attacks \nthroughout the country, and continue to threaten expatriate personnel and visitors. See \nRequest for Administrative Notice, Republic of Iraq; supra; Iraq 2020 Crime & Safety \nReport: Baghdad, U.S. Dept. of State (May 2020). Crime and lawlessness remain a \nserious threat throughout Iraq. In Baghdad, organized crime, uncontrolled militia activity, \nand corruption remain formidable obstacles to free enterprise and capital formation in \ngeneral. \nHuman rights issues continue to plague Iraq. Significant human rights violations \nin Iraq include unlawful or arbitrary killings (including extrajudicial killings); forced \ndisappearances; torture; arbitrary detention; harsh and life-threatening prison and \ndetention center conditions; arbitrary or unlawful interference with privacy; the worst \nforms of restrictions on free expression, the press, and the internet (including violence \nagainst journalists); censorship, site blocking, and criminal libel; significant interference \nwith the rights of peaceful assembly; legal restrictions on freedom of movement of \nwomen; threats of violence against internally displaced persons (IDPs) and returnee \npopulations perceived to have been affiliated with the Islam State of Iraq and Syria \n(ISIS); and widespread official corruption. Government investigations of alleged abuses \nand atrocities perpetrated by Iraqi security forces rarely produce punishment of those \nfound to be responsible.

(AE G) \n   Policies \nBy virtue of the jurisprudential principles recognized by the U.S. Supreme Court \nin Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988), \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a \nsecurity clearance.\u201d As Commander in Chief, \u201cthe President has the authority to control \naccess to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. \nEligibility for access to classified information may only be granted \u201cupon a finding that it \nis clearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe AGs list guidelines to be considered by judges in the decision-making \nprocess covering DOHA cases. These guidelines take into account factors that could \ncreate a potential conflict of interest for the individual applicant, as well as \nconsiderations that could affect the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified information. These guidelines include conditions that could raise a \nsecurity concern and may be disqualifying (disqualifying conditions), if any, and all of \nthe conditions that could mitigate security concerns, if any. \nThese guidelines must be considered before deciding whether or not a security \nclearance should be granted, continued, or denied. Although, the guidelines do not \nrequire judges to place exclusive reliance on the enumerated disqualifying and \nmitigating conditions in the guidelines in arriving at a decision. \nIn addition to the relevant AGs, judges must take into account the pertinent \nconsiderations for assessing extenuation and mitigation set forth in \u00b6 2(a) of the AGs, \nwhich are intended to assist the judges in reaching a fair and impartial, commonsense \ndecision based on a careful consideration of the pertinent guidelines within the context \nof the whole person. The adjudicative process is designed to examine a sufficient period \nof an applicant\u2019s life to enable predictive judgments to be made about whether the \napplicant is an acceptable security risk. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s conduct, the relevant guidelines are to be \nconsidered together with the following \u00b6 2(d) factors: (1) the nature, extent, and \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n8 \n\n \n \n                                                                                                                                              \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n                                                \nseriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include \nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which \nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other \npermanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation of the conduct; (8) the potential for \npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or \nrecurrence. \nViewing the issues raised and evidence as a whole, the following individual \nguidelines are pertinent herein: \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nForeign Influence \nThe Concern: Foreign contacts and interests, including, but not limited to, \nbusiness, financial, and property interests, are a national security concern \nif they result in divided allegiance. They may also be a national security \nconcern if they create circumstances in which the individual may be \nmanipulated or induced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or \ngovernment in a way inconsistent with U.S. interests or otherwise made \nvulnerable to pressure or coercion by any foreign interest. Assessment of \nforeign contacts and interests should consider he country in which the \nforeign contact or interest is located, including, but not limited to, \nconsiderations such as whether it is known to target U.S. citizens to obtain \nprotected classified or sensitive information or is associated with a risk of \nterrorism. See AG \u00b6 6. \n  Personal Conduct \nThe Concern: Conduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, \ndishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can \nraise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability, and trustworthiness, and \nability to protect classified or sensitive information. Of special interest is \nany failure to cooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during \nnational security investigative or adjudicative processes  . . . AG \u00b6 15. \nBurdens of Proof \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nabout potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nClearance decisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be \na determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See Exec.

Additional security concerns are raised over Applicant\u2019s \nfalsification of his employment application with a prior defense contractor in 2016 that \nresulted in his resigning under threat of termination as the result of his employer finding \nthat he had falsely claimed a degree in computer engineering. Further security concerns \nare raised over Applicant\u2019s taking the U.S. passports of his wife and children during a \nfamily visit to Iraq in June 2012 in an attempt to prevent their return to the United States. \nThe status of Applicant\u2019s mother, siblings, and brother-in-law as citizens and \nresidents of Iraq raise serious national security questions about Applicant\u2019s being \nplaced in a position in which he could be manipulated, pressured, or coerced by Iraqi \nmilitary and terrorist organizations operating in Iraq. These concerns present \nheightened security risks covered by two disqualifying conditions. (DC) \u00b6 7(a) of the \nAGs for foreign influence: \u201ccontact, regardless of method, with a foreign family member, \nbusiness or professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or resident \nin a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of foreign exploitation, \ninducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion\u201d; and DC \u00b6 7(b), \u201cconnections to a \nforeign person, group, government, or country that create a potential conflict of interest \nbetween the individual\u2019s obligation to protect classified or sensitive information or \ntechnology and the individual\u2019s desire to help a foreign person, group, or country by \nproviding that information or technology,\u201d apply to Applicant\u2019s situation. \nGenerally, the AGs governing collateral clearances do not dictate per se results \nor mandate particular outcomes for applicants with relationships and contacts with \npersons who are citizens and residents of foreign countries in general. What is \nconsidered to be an acceptable risk in one country may not be in another. The \n10 \n\n \n \n                                                                                                                                              \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ngeopolitical aims and policies of the particular country (in this case Iraq) do matter. See \nISCR Case No. 06-24575 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 9, 2007) \nSummarized, the AGs do take into account the country\u2019s demonstrated relations \nwith the United States as an important consideration in gauging whether the particular \nrelative, friend, or contact with citizenship and residency elsewhere, create a heightened \nsecurity risk. Iraq is a country occupied by terrorist organizations and is considered a \ncountry with a poor human rights record and one that is unsafe for travel by U.S. \ncitizens despite the country\u2019s having generally positive bilateral relations with the United \nStates. \nAppeal Board precedents hold that there is a rebuttable presumption that a \nperson has ties of affection for, or obligation to, the immediate family members of his or \nher spouse. ISCR Case No. 17-04208 at 4 (App. Bd. Aug. 7, 2019); ISCR Case no. 12-\n00084 at 2 (App. Bd. May 22, 2014); ISCR Case No. 10-09986 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 15 \n2011). Infrequency of contact with the family member (as is the case with Applicant\u2019s \nbrother-in-law) is not necessarily enough to rebut the presumption an applicant has ties \nof affection for, or obligation to, his or her own immediate family, as well as his or her \nspouse\u2019s family. See ISCR Case No. 17-01979 at 4 (App. Bd. July 31, 2019). \nWithout more information from Applicant about the status of his family members \nin Iraq and his personal relationships and contacts with them, none of the potentially \navailable mitigating conditions are applicable to his situation. Iraq remains a country \nwith heightened security risks that require a heavy burden of proof from Applicant to \ndemonstrate that neither he nor his Iraqi family members are subject to influence by the \nIraqi military or terrorist organizations operating within Iraq. See ISCR Case No. 06-\n24575, supra.  \nPersonal conduct concerns \nIn his 2016 employment application with a prior employer, Applicant falsely \nclaimed to have a bachelor\u2019s degree in computer engineering from an Iraqi university, \nwhich he did not have. When his employer discovered his false educational claim, it \nconfronted Applicant with its findings of his falsification and forced him to resign under \nthreat of involuntary termination. Despite assurances of avoiding any use of his false \ncomputer engineering degree in other U.S. employment applications, he has continued \nto claim a computer engineering degree in his LinkedIn profile. Applicant\u2019s falsification \nof his employment application with his previous employer warrants the application of DC \n\u00b6 16 (b), \u201cdeliberately providing false or misleading information, or concealing relevant \nfacts to an employer, investigator, security official, competent medical or mental health \nprofessional involved in making a recommendation relevant to a national security \neligibility determination, or other official government representative.\u201d \nApplicant\u2019s falsely claiming to possess a degree in computer engineering which \nhe did not have and his failure to correct the falsification with the profile he maintains on \nhis LinkedIn account until confronted at hearing precludes his taking advantage of any \npotentially available mitigating conditions.

See DISCR Case No. 93-1390 at 5 (App. Bd. Jan. 27, \n1995) \nIn the face of proven acts of falsification by Applicant in a 2016 employment \napplication and failure to demonstrably correct his educational falsity until confronted at \nhearing before promising to delete it from his LinkedIn profile comes too late to meet the \nmitigating requirements of MC \u00b6 17(a). His laudatory endorsements from his prior \nemployers in Iraq are not enough to counter his material educational misstatements. \nWhile this is not a close case on the issue of Applicant\u2019s falsifying a prior \nemployment application, even close cases must be resolved in the favor of the national \nsecurity. See Dept. of Navy v. Egan, supra. Quite apart from any candor expectation the \nGovernment may have for the clearance holder employed by a defense contractor, the \nGovernment has the right to expect honesty and candor from the trust relationship it has \nwith the clearance holder. See Snepp v. United States, 444 U.S. 507, 511n.6 (1980) \nOther raised personal conduct concerns about Applicant\u2019s withholding of the U.S. \npassports of his wife and children on a visit to Iraq in 2012, in an attempt to prevent \nthem from returning to the United States is very concerning as well. The trust \nrelationship that exists between a father and his wife and children is fundamental to the \nconcept of the nuclear family, whether appraised under U.S. laws and customs or under \nthe tenets of Sharia law that recognize the father\u2019s primary place in the family hierarchy. \nApplicant\u2019s breach of that trust responsibility without a worthy explanation or expression \nof contrition does not speak well for someone who seeks a position of trust with the U.S. \nGovernment. See United States v. Snepp, supra. \nTo Applicant\u2019s credit, he has made apparent amends with his wife and family in \nthe. U.S. residence they currently reside in. Considering all of the facts and \ncircumstances surrounding his withholding the passports of his wife and children while \nvisiting Iraq in 2012, to include the more than ten years of elapsed time since the 2012 \nincident, and his contributions to Iraq coalition forces in 2003-2008, Applicant\u2019s breach \nof trust incident can be considered an isolated breach of trust and good judgment and \nnot reflective of his current regard for his wife and children. \nWhole-person assessment \nWhole-person \nassessment \nof \nApplicant\u2019s \nclearance \neligibility \nrequires \nconsideration of whether his family members who are citizens and residents of Iraq are \n12 \n\n \n \n                                                                                                                                              \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n          \n \n           \n \n \n \n                            \n  \n \n               \n            \n \n \n \n                    \n                                        \n \n                     \n                                       \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n__________________________ \nfree from heightened risks of coercion, pressure, and influence from exploitation by Iraqi \nmilitary and terrorist organizations operating in Iraq consistent with safeguarding U.S. \nsecurity interests.

Applicant\u2019s withholding of his family\u2019s U.S. passports, while of \nconsiderable concern, is mitigated by the passage of time and his reconciliation with his \nwife and children. \nI have carefully applied the law, as set forth in Department of Navy v.

His pattern of false statements \ncontinues to raise personal conduct security concerns.

The SOR explained why \nthe DCSA CAF was unable to find it clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or \ncontinue security clearance eligibility for him. The DCSA CAF took the action under \nExecutive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February \n20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense (DOD) Directive 5220.6, Defense \nIndustrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended \n(Directive); and the National Security Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for \n1 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAccess to Classified Information or Eligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position (AG) effective \nwithin the DOD on June 8, 2017. \nApplicant responded to the SOR through his counsel on June 10, 2021. He \nrequested a hearing before an administrative judge from the Defense Office of Hearings \nand Appeals (DOHA). On September 23, 2021, Department Counsel indicated the \nGovernment was ready to proceed to a hearing. On October 7, 2021, the case was \nassigned to me to determine whether it is clearly consistent with the interests of national \nsecurity to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant. I received the case file and \nassignment on October 12, 2021. Scheduling the hearing was delayed due to COVID-\nrelated travel and duty restrictions. \nAfter some coordination with the parties, on March 2, 2022, I scheduled a video \nteleconference hearing to be held via Microsoft Teams on March 29, 2022. At the hearing, \nthe Government withdrew the Guideline F allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b-1.f. Nine Government \nexhibits (GEs 1-9) and 23 Applicant exhibits (AE A-W) were admitted in evidence without \nany objections. A March 10, 2020 SOR, which may not have been issued by the DCSA \nCAF but which is identical to the May 20, 2021 SOR but for the date, was marked as a \nhearing exhibit (HE 5) at Applicant\u2019s request. Applicant testified, as reflected in a hearing \ntranscript (Tr.) received by DOHA on April 6, 2022. \nThe Government submitted four separate requests for administrative notice \nconcerning Iraq (HE 1), Turkey (HE 2), Egypt (HE 3), and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) \n(HE 4), which I marked as hearing exhibits (HE). Applicant confirmed through counsel that \nhe received the Government\u2019s requests for administrative notice with extracts of the source \ndocuments, and he had no objection to any of the facts proposed for administrative notice \nwith respect to Iraq, Turkey, Egypt, or the UAE. \nPursuant to my obligation to take administrative notice of the most current political \nconditions in evaluating Guideline B concerns (see ISCR Case No. 05-11292 at (App. Bd. \nApr. 12, 2007)), I informed the parties of my intention to take administrative notice of the \nfacts requested by the Government with respect to Iraq, Turkey, Egypt, and the UAE, \nsubject to the reliability of the source documentation and the relevance and materiality of \nthe facts proposed. \nI held the record open for ten days after the hearing for Applicant\u2019s counsel to \nproposed facts for administrative notice. Applicant did not propose any facts for \nadministrative notice by the deadline, but he submitted on April 8, 2022, two documents, \nwhich were accepted into evidence as AEs X and Y without objection. The record closed \non April 11, 2022, on receipt of the Government\u2019s position with respect to AEs X and Y. \nAdministrative Notice \nAt the hearing, the Government\u2019s Request for Administrative Notice \u2013 Republic of \nIraq (HE 1), dated March 22, 2022, was based on 11 U.S. government publications: six \nfrom the U.S. State Department; two from the U.S. Congressional Research Service; one \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nfrom the U.S. Department of Defense; one from the Office of the Director of National \nIntelligence; and one from the U.S. Department of Homeland Security. The Government\u2019s \nRequest for Administrative Notice \u2013 Republic of Turkey (HE 2), dated March 22, 2022, was \nbased on six publications from the U.S. State Department. The Government\u2019s Request for \nAdministrative Notice \u2013 Arab Republic of Egypt (HE 3), dated March 25, 2022, was based \non ten U.S. government publications: five from the U.S. State Department, including one \nfrom the U.S. Embassy in Egypt; one from the Central Intelligence Agency; two from the \nU.S. Justice Department; one from the Office of the Director of National Intelligence; and \none from the U.S. Mission to International Organizations in Geneva. The Government\u2019s \nRequest for Administrative Notice \u2013 United Arab Emirates (HE 4), dated March 25, 2022, \nwas based on ten U.S. government publications: five from the U.S. State Department; one \nfrom the Central Intelligence Agency; three from the U.S. Commerce Department; and one \nfrom the U.S. Justice Department. The most salient facts administratively noticed are set \nforth below. \nSummary of SOR Allegations \nThe amended SOR alleges under Guideline F that Applicant owed delinquent debts \ntotaling $8,848 on four accounts (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b, 1.g, and 1.h). Under Guideline E, the \nSOR alleges that Applicant was arrested for simple assault in April 2015 for punching his \nwife (SOR \u00b6 2.a); was terminated from a job in November 2015 after punching another \nemployee (SOR \u00b6 2.b); lied to his then employer in 2017 on three separate occasions \n(SOR \u00b6 2.c-2.e); and falsified his March 2018 Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations \nProcessing (hereafter SF 86) by failing to disclose a residence (SOR \u00b6 2.f) and \nemployment terminations for cause from three different employers (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.g-2.i). \nUnder Guideline B, the SOR alleges that Applicant\u2019s mother (SOR \u00b6 3.a), a brother \nemployed by the Iraqi government (SOR \u00b6 3.b), and two of his sisters (SOR \u00b6 3.d) are \nresident citizens of Iraq; that two of his brothers (SOR \u00b6 3.c), one of whom he has \nsupported financially, and four of his sisters (SOR \u00b6 3.e) are citizens of Iraq residing in the \nUAE; and that a sister who he has supported financially is a citizen of Iraq residing in Egypt \n(SOR \u00b6 3.f). Additionally, the SOR alleges that Applicant\u2019s father-in-law, who was a police \nofficer for the Iraqi government from 1986 to 2005 (SOR \u00b6 3.g), mother-in-law (SOR \u00b6 3.h), \nand two sisters-in-law (SOR \u00b6 3.i) are resident citizens of Iraq, who with the exception of \none sister-in-law, have received financial support from Applicant; and that Applicant has \nthree brothers-in-law who are citizens of Iraq residing in Turkey (SOR \u00b6 3.j). \nWhen Applicant responded to the SOR allegations, he denied all of the Guideline F \nand Guideline E allegations without explanation. He admitted the Guideline B allegations \nwith some clarifications. He explained that his mother died of COVID-19 in April 2020. He \nstated that he has had no communications with his siblings in Iraq and the UAE or with his \nfather-in-law in Iraq since he began working as a linguist and that he has had no \ncommunications with the other members of his spouse\u2019s family since 2019. As for his sister \nin Egypt, Applicant explained that this sister raised him, and that he did not support her \nfinancially but sent her small monetary gifts on special occasions, such as birthdays, \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nholidays, and her son\u2019s graduation.

(GE 1.) He \napplied for a DOD security clearance in March 2018 for work, as needed, as a contract \nlinguist for the U.S. government. (GE 1.) He served as a translator from January 2019 until \nOctober 2021, including on training missions overseas from November 2019 to June 2020 \n(AEs T-U; Tr. 84.) In October 2021, he was laid off, but another company is holding a \nlinguist position for him should his clearance be adjudicated favorably. (Tr.84-85.) He \nworks in the civilian sector as a team lead on second shift for a manufacturer where he \nearns about $60,000 annually. (AE P; Tr. 39.) His spouse works as a machine operator in \nthe United States and earns about $24,000 annually. (Tr. 39-40.) \n \nApplicant and his spouse, also a native of Iraq, married in Iraq in March 2004. (GE \n1; AE I; Tr. 40.) They had their first child, a daughter, in April 2005. (GE 1.) They fled Iraq \nfor Syria in May 2006. (GE 3.) After waiting two years for a decision on their application for \nrefugee status, Applicant, his spouse, and their daughter immigrated to the United States \nas refugees in April 2009. (GE 2.) Their second child, another daughter, was born in the \nUnited States in June 2009. (GE 1; AE J.) Applicant and his spouse became naturalized \nU.S. citizens in June 2014 (AE I), and obtained their U.S. passports in July 2014. (AE K.) \nApplicant indicated on his SF 86 that he is solely a citizen of the United States since \nrenouncing his Iraqi citizenship and surrendering his expired Iraqi passport to his employer \nof his own free will in February 2018. (GE 1.) He stated, in part: \nI recognize that not renouncing citizenship could pose questions as to my \nloyalty to the United States. I willingly renounce any and all allegiance to \nprevious country of citizenship, surrender my active/expired passport(s) and \npledge my loyalty exclusively to the United States of America. I take these \nactions to demonstrate my loyalty to the United States and my responsibility \nto protect sensitive information and those sensitive circumstances that I may \nencounter as I carry out my duties and responsibilities to the UNITED \nSTATES OF AMERICA. (GE 1.) \nApplicant asserts that he completed paperwork to formally renounce his Iraqi \ncitizenship when he was offered a position as a contract linguist. (GE 2.) He provided no \ndocumentation indicating that Iraq no longer considers a citizen of Iraq. Applicant\u2019s spouse \nand his 16-year-old daughter are dual citizens of Iraq and the United States (GE 1) while \nhis 12-year-old daughter is a citizen solely of the United States. (GE 1; AE J.) \nDuring the course of his background investigation, Applicant underwent a \ncounterintelligence security screening (CSS) interview in February 2018.

Substantive facts \nabout his finances, personal conduct, and foreign contacts disclosed on his SF 86, during \nthe CSS interview and PSIs, on forms completed for the CSS, or otherwise revealed during \nthe course of his background investigation and the adjudication process follow. \nFinancial Considerations \nOn February 22, 2018, Applicant completed a Personal Financial Statement for his \nCSS. He estimated that he had positive net income of $532 per month after paying his \nmonthly expenses, but he did not list any payments towards eight charged-off credit-card \naccounts totaling $27,037 and two collection accounts totaling $251. (GE 4.) When \ninterviewed during his CSS, he described his credit as \u201cmessed up.\u201d He indicated that his \nspouse handled \u201cthat stuff,\u201d and she was fixing it. He explained that he became delinquent \non several accounts because he quit a job and was not able to find employment at a \nsufficient income to settle his bills. (GE 3.) He quit several jobs in 2017, some lasting as \nlittle as three or four days, because he did not like the work. He derived some income from \nself-employment as an Uber driver. (GE 1.) \nOn his March 2018 SF 86, Applicant listed nine outstanding charged-off credit-card \naccounts totaling $27,080 and two accounts totaling $251 in collections status. He \nattributed the debts to being laid off and stated that he would pay them when he had \npermanent employment. (GE 1.) \n \nAs of March 6, 2018, Applicant\u2019s credit report listed four debts totaling $11,459 that \nhad been charged off between January 2016 and May 2016, including the debt in SOR \u00b6 \n1.a charged off for $4,396 in January 2016; five accounts in collections totaling $5,363, \nincluding the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.h unpaid since January 2016; and a credit-card account \nbalance of $2,519 past due 120 days (SOR \u00b6 1.g) as of January 2016. Applicant had paid \noff several car loans on time over the years, including a $2,614 loan for a motorcycle \npurchased in October 2013 that he paid off in April 2015. He was making timely payments \nof $232 a month on a mortgage loan obtained for $47,200 in August 2012. (GE 7.) \nDuring his March 2018 PSI, Applicant described his financial situation as favorable, \nas he had approximately $20,000 in savings in a safe deposit box in a bank. Most of the \nfunds came from cashing in a 401(k) in 2015. When asked about his unresolved delinquent \ndebts, Applicant readily admitted the debts that were on his credit report, and explained \nthat he had established plans to repay three of his past-due debts listed on his SF 86 for \n$43, $7,333, and $3,030 but not alleged in the amended SOR. He admitted during his PSI \nthat he intentionally defaulted on his past-due accounts because his spouse had an affair \nin 2015 and he wanted to save money for an attorney in case he and his spouse \nseparated. (GE 2.) He now asserts that his financial problems were due to lack of income \nwhen his only source of income was as an Uber driver.

(GE 8; AEs A-E.) \nApplicant testified that he received an IRS Form 1099-C Cancellation of Debt for the debt \nin SOR \u00b6 1.a and reported the amount of the cancelled debt on his income tax return for \ntax year 2019. (Tr. 44, 67.) The delinquency in SOR \u00b6 1.g was still on Applicant\u2019s credit \nreport as of March 2022. (GE 9.) The creditor discharged $1,436 of Applicant\u2019s debt in \n2019. (AE F; Tr. 67-68.) Applicant asserts that he paid the remainder of his debt in \nsettlement and reported the $1,436 as income on his tax return for tax year 2019. (Tr. 44, \n68.) Applicant settled the collection debt in SOR \u00b6 1.h for less than its full balance. He \nmade three monthly payments of $152.79 between September 2019 and November 2019. \n(AE G.) \nIn October 2019, Applicant obtained a $2,000 loan from a credit union. He made \ntimely payments and paid it off in April 2021. In December 2019, Applicant and a co-obligor \nleased a car. They made timely payments on the $17,830 debt at $495 a month, and the \nlease was terminated early in November 2021. (GE 9.) \nOn April 30, 2021, Applicant and his spouse sold their then residence for $130,000. \n(AE M.) In July 2021, he and his spouse purchased their current home for $370,000. They \nobtained a real estate mortgage for $324,175. (AEs O, S; Tr. 47.) As of March 2022, they \nwere making their monthly payments of $2,145 on time. (GE 9.) \nApplicant earned gross income from linguist duties of $44,028 and from his work as \na machine operator for a local company $18,283 in 2021. He reported wage income of \n$18,283 on his income tax return for tax year 2021. (AE P.) He has had some financial \ncounseling in March 2022. (AE W.) \nPersonal Conduct \nApplicant was arrested on April 26, 2015, and charged with domestic-related simple \nassault with physical contact, a class A misdemeanor (SOR \u00b6 2.a). (GEs 1-3.) His spouse \nobtained a protective order against him. The charge was nolle prossed on October 26, \n2015. (GE 5.) On his petition, the record of the arrest and charge was annulled by the \nstate. (AE H.) He listed the charge on his SF 86. (GE 1.) He indicated during his CSS \ninterview that he had argued with his spouse; that he was arrested for simple assault for \nphysically restraining his spouse in front of the police; and that his spouse did not press \ncharges, which led to the charge being dismissed. (GE 3.) During his March 2018 PSI, \nApplicant stated that he was arrested for assaulting his wife and paid $40 bail to be \nreleased. He reportedly told the investigator that his spouse admitted she had had an affair \nwith an American and that he \u201csnapped\u201d and punched her in the face and chest for about \n6 \n\n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n15 to 20 minutes. He volunteered that the police were called to his residence by a neighbor \nsome three or four times because of arguments he had with his spouse, but he also \nasserted that the police made his wife say that he hit her more than he did. He explained \nthat he had thought it was okay to hit his spouse because she had violated their marriage. \n(GE 2.) He now denies that he was arrested; that he physically struck his spouse; or \nrestrained her in any way apart from hugging her. (Tr. 47-48, 83.) He testified on cross \nexamination about the incident involving his spouse, as follows: \nThat was when I was yelling. And that\u2019s why the neighbor called the police. It \nwas arguing and yelling. I didn\u2019t do anything to her. And she didn\u2019t show up \nat the court, and the case got dismissed. If something happened, she would \nshow at the court and she\u2019d do something to me. And here we go again. \nWe\u2019re still here and we love each other. And we just bought a house, and we \nhave a nice life. (Tr. 82.)  \nDuring his February 2018 CSS interview (GE 3), and on his March 2018 SF 86 (GE \n1), Applicant listed his job placements rather than the staffing agency that paid him. With \nrespect to each of these employments, including seasonal and temporary jobs, Applicant \nresponded negatively to SF 86 inquiries into whether he was fired; quit after being told he \nwould be fired; left by mutual agreement following charges or allegations of misconduct; or \nleft by mutual agreement following notice of unsatisfactory performance. (GE 1.) \nApplicant reported on his SF 86 that he worked as a machine operator for a \ncompany for three days in July 2015 [sic] and that he left because he did not like the job \n(SOR \u00b6 2.i). Records of the staffing company that placed Applicant and paid him indicate \nthat Applicant called in sick on April 1, 2015, and again on April 2, 2015. When contacted \nby his supervisor on April 2, 2015, Applicant indicated that he could not return to work and \nhung up on his supervisor. He was placed in an inactive status for not showing up to work. \n(GE 6.) When asked about that job during his March 2018 PSI, he explained that he left \nwithout notice. He did not like the job and did not believe that he had to call in his \nresignation. (GE 2.) He testified at his hearing that he could not work in the environment \nand that he left by mutual agreement. (Tr. 56.) \nIn June 2016, Applicant worked for a couple of days for a company in its \nwarehouse. He quit without notice because he did not like the position. (GE 2.) The SOR \nalleges, and Applicant denies, that he was terminated for being a \u201cno show\u201d (SOR \u00b6 2.g). \nNo record was provided in evidence to prove that he was fired. \nThe SOR alleges that Applicant was terminated from his employment with a \npackage shipping company in November 2015 (SOR \u00b6 2.b) for punching a co-worker in the \nface (SOR \u00b6 2.h). During his CSS interview (GE 3) and on his SF 86 (GE 1), Applicant \nreported that he worked a temporary job for a package delivery company in its warehouse \nfrom April 2015 until January 2016, and he left when the job was completed. The OPM \ninvestigator who interviewed Applicant in March 2018 reports that Applicant stated that, in \nNovember 2015, he punched a co-worker in the face, and that the police came to talk with \nhim about it. Applicant was adamant that he was not fired.

He explained that after the co-worker used an expletive towards him, he punched \nthe co-worker in the face in defense. In July 2019, by way of interrogatories, Applicant was \ngiven the opportunity to review the report of his March 2018 PSI, which contained the \nadmission by him that he had punched the co-worker in the face. Applicant indicated, \u201cI \ndidn\u2019t punched [sic] my co-worker. I just put my hand on his shoulder and ask him if what \nhe said was for me but he didn\u2019t respond to me then I let him go.\u201d (GE 2.) Applicant \ncurrently denies that he punched the co-worker and asserts that he just walked out, told the \nstaffing company that he was not going to work there any longer, and was placed as a \nwarehouse worker with another company the next day. (Tr. 48-49, 55.) On cross \nexamination, he stated that he argued with the co-worker but never hit him. (Tr. 79-80.) \nApplicant indicated during his CSS interview (GE 3) and on his SF 86 (GE 1) that he \nworked as a material handler for a tool and die company from January 2016 to March \n2017, but also that he had overlapping employment for a few weeks in January 2017 with \nan aerospace and defense company. Investigative checks revealed that he was paid by a \nstaffing company (company X) and was placed as a temporary worker with the tool and die \ncompany. He indicated on his SF 86 that he left the job when it ended. He discrepantly \nadmitted during his March 2018 PSI that he quit that assignment without warning because \nhe did not like the tone of his supervisor. (GE 2.) \nDuring his May 2018 PSI, Applicant was asked about developed information \nconcerning reprimands he had received while in company X\u2019s employ, including for taking \ntime off in January 2017 for the stated reason that his spouse was leaving him because he \nwas not home (SOR \u00b6 2.c). Applicant admitted to the OPM investigator that he had lied to \nhis supervisor because he did not like the job, wanted her to think he was too upset to \nwork, and wanted the supervisor to give him a new assignment. (GE 2.) He now claims that \nhe was misunderstood, and that the issue was that his spouse did not like his work hours. \n(Tr. 49.) \nApplicant\u2019s employment file with company X reflected that he resided in Iraq from \nlate March 2017 to early November 2017, and that he had told his supervisor that he had \nmoved to Iraq to work on his marriage (SOR \u00b6 2.d). Applicant explained during his May \n2018 PSI that he had lied to his supervisor because he sought other employment and did \nnot want her to be upset with him because he might need another assignment from the \nstaffing company in the future. (GE 2.) He characterized it as \u201ca white lie,\u201d when asked \nabout it during direct examination at his hearing. He explained that it did not hurt anyone, \nand he wanted to keep his options open with the agency for a future job. (Tr. 50-51.) On \ncross examination, Applicant recalled having said \u201ca little white lie\u201d to the staffing company \nin 2018 so that he could keep the job (Tr. 77.) \nIn January 2018, Applicant was placed by staffing company X in an assembly \nposition with his current civilian employer. (Tr. 52, 77-78.) Applicant took leave from work \nfor two weeks in February 2018. He told company X that he went to Iraq for the funeral of \nhis brother, who he claimed had died in an explosion (SOR \u00b6 2.e).

He explained during his May 2018 PSI that \nhe did not want his supervisor at company X to know that he was seeking employment \nelsewhere. When asked by the OPM investigator whether his supervisor knew that he lied \nto her, he responded negatively, described himself as \u201ca good liar,\u201d and stated that it was \nokay to tell \u201cwhite lies.\u201d (GE 2.) He now asserts that he will not make a false statement or \ntell \u201ca white lie\u201d in the future. (Tr. 78.) \nOn his SF 86 and during his March 2018 PSI, Applicant indicated that he had owned \nhis then-residence since June 2012. He listed no other residences in the last ten years and \nsaid during his March 2018 PSI that all was going well at that residence. (GEs 1-2.) During \nhis May 2018 PSI, Applicant was asked any unreported residences in the previous ten \nyears. He responded negatively and asserted that all information about his residences was \naccurate (SOR \u00b6 2.f). Investigative checks revealed that a complaint had been lodged with \nthe police in April 2016 for \u201ctheft of services.\u201d Applicant\u2019s children were still attending \nschool in the district but no longer living there. A police officer went to Applicant\u2019s listed \nresidence and discovered that it was being rented out. After hesitating, Applicant explained \nthat he and his family rented an apartment in another locale from February 2016 to \napproximately November 2016 as he wanted to leave his house because he was tired of \nthe police \u201charassing\u201d him. He explained that he thought his children could still attend \nschool in the district because he still owed the apartment there. As to why he did not \naccurately report his residency in 2016, Applicant responded that he \u201cwas not lying.\u201d He \ndenied any intentional falsification. When given the opportunity to review the report of his \nMay 2018 PSI, Applicant admitted that he had lived at the unlisted apartment but had not \nreported it because he had not completed a change of address form and received his mail \nat the apartment that he owned and had rented out in 2016. (GE 2.) He reiterated at his \nhearing that he misunderstood the question and did not submit a change of address form, \nso he considered it his legal address. (Tr. 52-53, 74-75.) \nForeign Influence \nApplicant\u2019s and his spouse\u2019s family members are all Iraqi citizens.

(GE 1.) \nDuring his March 2018 interview with the OPM investigator, Applicant explained that \nthe financial support was for his parents-in-law and his sister in Egypt; that since early \n2017, he and his spouse had sent about $250 a month consistently to her parents; and \nthat they had sent about $5,750 to her parents in the seven years prior to 2017. As for his \nsister in Egypt, Applicant related that he had given her about $2,000 at $400 a year to help \nher out. When asked about any other financial support, Applicant stated that he sent \n$10,000 to brother 3 for rent in 2016, and his brother has repaid him. When discussing his \ncontacts with his family members, according to the investigator, Applicant stated that he \nand his spouse agreed in February 2018 that they were no longer allowed to talk to their \nfamily members because his spouse felt he disclosed too much to his family about their \npersonal lives, and the relatives want to borrow money because they know too much. (GE \n2.) Applicant does not now recall stating that to the investigator. (Tr. 73.) \nSince coming to the United States as a refugee in April 2009, Applicant traveled for \nalmost a month from December 2014 to January 2015 to the UAE and from May 2017 to \nJune 2017 to Iraq to visit family members.

He \ndenies any contact with his other siblings, who reside in the UAE, since his trip to Dubai in \n2019. (Tr. 57-60.) He denies any contact with his sister in Egypt since 2019. (Tr. 61.) He \nasserts that after working as a linguist, he realized that any ties with them would affect his \njob, so he cut all his overseas contacts. (Tr. 58, 69-70.) According to Applicant, his family \nmembers are unaware of why he has not contacted them. He just stopped calling them. \n(Tr. 70.) \n \nLikewise, Applicant denies any contact with his in-laws in Iraq since 2017. (Tr. 61-\n62.) As for financial support for his mother-in-law, he stated that it was his spouse that \nprovided the support to her mother and sisters in Iraq. Since he worked on second shift, his \nwife would give him the money, which he sent on her behalf before going to work. (Tr. 63.) \nAfter he began working for the U.S. military, he told his spouse that she had to stop \nsending support, and she complied. (Tr. 62-63.) He asserts that his three brothers-in-law \nwere living in Turkey in 2017, and he has had no contact with them since he spoke with \nthem by telephone in 2017. (Tr. 63.) \nAs to his spouse\u2019s contacts with her parents and siblings in Iraq, Applicant \nresponded that he does not think she talks to them. He and his spouse work different \nhours. He has not seen her talk to her family and does not know when she last spoke with \nthem. He denies that he has any contact with her family. (Tr. 87.) \nCharacter and Employment References \nApplicant received a certificate of appreciation in June 2020 for outstanding \nperformance and patriotism from the squadron where he served as a linguist from \nNovember 2019 to June 2020. (AE T.) A staff sergeant on the mission, which consisted of \n14 weeks of difficult training between U.S. soldiers and 80 of a foreign country\u2019s soldiers in \nthat country, indicates that Applicant was one of the best linguists he has worked with. He \ndescribed Applicant as motivated and having a caring personality that contributed to the \nestablishment of an excellent working relationship between the U.S. and foreign country\u2019s \nsoldiers. The staff sergeant described Applicant as \u201can exceptional asset,\u201d who far \nexceeded the standards set for him. (AE U.) \nThe officer-in-charge (OIC) for five months of the mission, a lieutenant, attests that \nApplicant\u2019s \u201cprofessionalism and dedication to the job was on clear display every day he \nwas on duty.\u201d When under a \u201creal world threat of indirect fire,\u201d Applicant left the safety of \nthe bunkers to provide Arabic instructions over the loudspeaker.

(AE U.) \nAdministrative Notice \nThose facts set forth in the Government\u2019s respective requests for Administrative \nNotice concerning Iraq, Turkey, Egypt, and the UAE are adopted and incorporated in this \ndecision. \n \nIraq is a constitutional parliamentary republic. The United States is committed to an \nenduring partnership with Iraq toward ensuring its sovereignty and stability and combating \nterrorism and extremism in the country. The U.S. government has obligated more than \n$405 million for the stabilization of liberated areas since 2016. Even so, the U.S. State \nDepartment advises against travel to Iraq due to COVID-19, terrorism, kidnapping, armed \nconflict, and the U.S. mission in Iraq\u2019s limited capacity to provide support for U.S. citizens. \nNumerous terrorist and insurgent groups, including remnants of the Islamic State in Iraq \nand Syria (ISIS) and Iran-aligned militia groups, are active in Iraq. Although the Iraqi \ngovernment declared all of its territory liberated from ISIS in December 2017, ISIS remains \na threat to public safety through the indiscriminate use of terrorist and asymmetrical attacks \nin Iraq. In 2020, terrorists conducted more than 100 attacks using improvised explosive \ndevices (IEDs) and launched at least 40 indirect fire attacks against U.S. interests in Iraq. \nAs of May 2020, the threat of kidnapping, rocket and mortar attacks, use of IEDs, and \nsmall-arms fire against official and private U.S. interests remained high. Baghdad is \nconsidered a critical-threat location for terrorism directed at or affecting official U.S.- \ngovernment interests. Organized crime, uncontrolled militia activity, and corruption \npresented formidable obstacles to free enterprise and business in the city. \nAs of April 2021, the U.S. intelligence community\u2019s assessment was that the Iraqi \ngovernment would almost certainly continue to struggle to fight ISIS and control Iranian-\nbacked Shia militias which target U.S. interests. ISIS remains capable of waging a \nprolonged insurgency in Iraq and Syria, and that Iran will retain its problematic presence in \nIraq. According to the latest State Department report on human rights abuses (See \nwww.state.gov/reports/2021-country-reports-on-human-rights-practices/Iraq, released on \nApril 12, 2022), ISIS continued to commit serious abuses and atrocities in 2021, including \nkillings through suicide bombings and improvised explosive devices. Iraq\u2019s government \ncontinued investigations and prosecutions of allegations of ISIS abuses and atrocities and, \nin some instances, noted the conviction of suspected ISIS members under the \ncounterterrorism law, however. \nSignificant human rights issues in 2020 and 2021 included credible reports of: \nunlawful or arbitrary killings, including extrajudicial killings by the government; forced \ndisappearances by the government; torture and cruel, inhuman, and degrading treatment \nor punishment by the government; harsh and life-threatening prison conditions; arbitrary \narrest and detention; arbitrary or unlawful interference with privacy; serious restrictions on \nfree expression and media, including violence or threats of violence against journalists, \n12 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nunjustified arrests and prosecutions against journalists, censorship, and existence of \ncriminal libel laws; serious restrictions on Internet freedom; substantial interference with the \nfreedom of peaceful assembly and freedom of association; restrictions on freedom of \nmovement of women; forced returns of internally displaced persons to locations where they \nfaced threats to their lives and freedom; threats of violence against internally displaced \npersons and returnee populations perceived to have been affiliated with ISIS; serious \ngovernment corruption; lack of investigation and accountability for gender-based violence; \ncrimes involving violence targeting members of ethnic minority groups; crimes involving \nviolence or threats of violence targeting lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, or \nintersex persons; significant restrictions on worker freedom of association; and the \nexistence of the worst forms of child labor. \nTurkey is a constitutional republic. The Organization for Security and Cooperation in \nEurope expressed concern about restrictions on media reporting and campaigning in the \ncountry\u2019s presidential and parliamentary elections in 2018. Turkey remains a key NATO ally \nand a critical regional partner such that the United States remains committed to improving \nrelations with Turkey. Yet, In December 2020, the United States imposed sanctions against \nTurkey for procuring from Russia\u2019s main arms-export entity the S-400 surface-to-air missile \nsystem, despite the availability of alternative, NATO-interoperable systems to meet its \ndefense requirements. \nThe U.S. State Department currently advises U.S. citizens to not travel to Turkey \ndue to COVID-19 and to exercise increased caution in Turkey due to terrorism and \narbitrary detention. Terrorist groups continue to plot attacks in Turkey with little or no \nwarning against tourist locations; transportation hubs; markets and shopping malls; local \ngovernment facilities; hotels; clubs; places of worship; parks; major sporting and cultural \nevents; educational institutions; airports; and other public areas. Terrorists have previously \nattacked the U.S. Embassy in Ankara, the U.S. Consulate General in Istanbul; and the U.S. \nConsulate in Adana. Turkey\u2019s security forces have detained tens of thousands of \nindividuals, including U.S. citizens, for alleged affiliations with terrorist organizations based \non scant or secret evidence and grounds that appear to be politically motivated. U.S. \ncitizens have also been subject to travel bans that prevent them from leaving Turkey. \nTurkey is a source and transit country for foreign terrorist fighters seeking to join \nISIS and other terrorist groups fighting in Syria and Iraq, even as it is an active member of \nthe Global Coalition to defeat ISIS. Several terrorist incidents involving roadside bombs, \nIEDs, suicide bombers, rocket attacks have occurred in Turkey in recent years. \nUnder broad anti-terrorism legislation passed in 2018, Turkey\u2019s government \ncontinues to restrict fundamental freedoms and compromise the rule of law. Significant \nhuman rights issues in the country in 2020 and 2021 included credible reports of: arbitrary \nkillings; suspicious deaths of persons in custody; forced disappearances; torture; arbitrary \narrest and continued detention of tens of thousands of persons, including opposition \npoliticians and former members of parliament, lawyers, journalists, human rights activists, \nand employees of the U.S. Mission, for purported ties to \u201cterrorist\u201d groups or peaceful \nlegitimate speech; political prisoners, including elected officials; politically motivated \n13 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nreprisal against individuals located outside the country, including kidnappings and transfers \nwithout due process of alleged members of the Gulen movement; significant problems with \njudicial independence; support for Syrian opposition groups that perpetrated serious \nabuses in conflict, including the recruitment and use of child soldiers; severe restrictions on \nfreedom of expression, the press, and the Internet, including violence and threats of \nviolence against journalists, closure of media outlets, and arrests or criminal prosecution of \njournalists and others for criticizing government policies or officials, censorship, site \nblocking, and criminal libel laws; severe restriction of freedoms of assembly, association, \nand movement, including overly restrictive laws regarding government oversight of \nnongovernmental organizations and civil society organizations; serious government \nharassment of domestic human rights organizations; and gender-based violence. In 2021, \nthe government took limited steps to investigate, prosecute, and punish members of the \nsecurity forces and other officials accused of human rights abuses but impunity remained a \nproblem. The government took limited steps to investigate allegations of high-level \ncorruption. \nEgypt is a republic governed by an elected president and bicameral legislature, with \nthe upper house reconstituted in 2020 as the Senate after a six-year absence. Presidential \nelections were held in 2018. Challengers to incumbent President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi \nwithdrew ahead of the election, citing personal decisions, political pressure, legal troubles, \nand unfair competition. In some cases, they were arrested for alleged abuses of candidacy \nrules. Domestic and international organizations expressed concern that government \nlimitations on association, assembly, and expression severely constrained broad \nparticipation in the political process. Egypt has been implicated in some economic \nespionage activity to obtain sensitive U.S. technology. In August 2019, a naturalized U.S. \ncitizen living in Egypt was found guilty of a scheme to sell hundreds of rocket-propelled \ngrenade launchers to Egypt\u2019s Ministry of Defense. \nThe U.S. State Department current advises against travel to Egypt due to COVID-19 \nand to reconsider travel to the country because of terrorism. The U.S. Embassy has limited \nability to assist dual U.S.-Egyptian citizens who are arrested or detained. The country has \nbeen under an almost continuous state of emergency since 2017 following the terrorist \nattacks on Coptic churches. Cairo is assessed as being a critical-threat location for \nterrorism directed at or affecting official U.S. government interests. Several terrorist \norganizations operate within the country, although recent attacks using small arms or IEDs, \nor involving kidnappings, executions, assaults, ambushes, and triggered assassinations \nhave been largely in the Sinai region. \nSignificant human rights issues in Egypt in 2020 and 2021 included credible reports \nof: unlawful or arbitrary killings, including extrajudicial killings by the government or its \nagents, and by terrorist groups; forced disappearance by state security; torture and cases \nof cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment or punishment by the government; harsh and \nlife-threatening prison conditions; arbitrary detention; political prisoners or detainees; \npolitically motivated reprisals against individuals located in another country; arbitrary or \nunlawful interference with privacy; serious restrictions on free expression and media, \nincluding arrests or prosecutions of journalists, censorship, site blocking, and the abuse of \n14 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ncriminal libel laws; serious restrictions on internet freedom; substantial interference with the \nfreedom of peaceful assembly and freedom of association, including overly restrictive laws \non the organization, funding, or operation of nongovernmental and civil society \norganizations; restrictions on freedom of movement, including travel bans imposed on \nhuman rights defenders, journalists, and activists; serious and unreasonable restrictions on \npolitical participation; serious government restrictions on domestic and international human \nrights organizations; and crimes involving violence or threats of violence targeting lesbian, \ngay, bisexual, transgender, queer, or intersex persons and use of the law to arrest and \nprosecute arbitrarily such persons. In March 2021, the United States joined a statement by \nFinland of concern about Egypt\u2019s restrictions on freedom of expression and assembly and \nthe applications of terrorism legislation against peaceful activists. \nIn 2021, the Egyptian government failed to consistently punish or prosecute officials \nwho committed abuses, whether in the security services or elsewhere in government, \nincluding for corruption. In most cases the government did not comprehensively investigate \nallegations of human rights abuses, including most incidents of violence by security forces, \ncontributing to an environment of impunity. \n \nThe UAE is a federation of seven semi-autonomous emirates whose rulers \nconstitute the Federal Supreme Council, the UAE\u2019s highest legislative and executive body. \nThe emirates are under patriarchal rule with political allegiance defined by loyalty to tribal \nleaders, leaders of the individual emirates, and leaders of the federation. The U.S. State \nDepartment encourages U.S. citizens to reconsider traveling to the UAE due to COVID-19 \nand the threat of missile or drone attacks by rebel groups in Yemen. Abu Dhabi and Dubai \nare medium-threat locations for terrorism directed at or affecting U.S. government interests. \nThe continued threat posed by terrorist groups in the UAE seeking to target U.S. interests \nrequires those working or traveling in the UAE to remain vigilant, maintain a low profile, and \nvary routes, times, and routines. \nThe UAE seeks to be a leader in combating violent extremism, and advanced its \ncounterterrorism efforts in 2020 in the area of countering terrorist financing. Even so, U.S. \ndual-use goods and technology, including military and electronic components and Internet \ntechnology, have passed through the UAE and UAE-owned businesses to destinations \nsuch as Iran and Syria. In September 2020, the U.S. Commerce Department added 11 \nentities or individuals under the destination of the UAE to its list of 47 entities determined to \nact contrary to the export control regulations and the national security or foreign policy \ninterests of the United States. \nCivilian authorities in the UAE maintain effective control over the security forces. In \n2021, the UAE government investigated, prosecuted, and punished some officials who \ncommitted abuses, primarily official financial crimes. However, some significant human \nrights issues in 2020 and 2021 included credible reports of: torture in detention; arbitrary \narrest and detention, including incommunicado detention by government agents; political \nprisoners; government interference with privacy rights; undue restrictions on free \nexpression and media, including censorship and criminalization of libel; Internet site-\nblocking; substantial interference with the freedom of peaceful assembly and freedom of \n15 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \nassociation, including very restrictive laws on the organization, funding, or operation of \nnongovernmental organizations and civil society organizations; inability of citizens to \nchange their government peacefully in free and fair elections; serious and unreasonable \nrestrictions on political participation; and serious government restrictions or harassment of \ndomestic and international human rights organizations. \nPolicies \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion the Executive \nBranch has in regulating access to information pertaining to national security, emphasizing \nthat \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 \nU.S. 518, 528 (1988). When evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, \nthe administrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are required to be considered in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. These guidelines \nare not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, \nthese guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative \nprocess. The administrative judge\u2019s overall adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious \nscrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative \njudge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, \nfavorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence \nto establish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant \nis responsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation about potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Section 7 of EO 10865 \nprovides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a \ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section \n3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information). \n16 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \nAnalysis \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nThe security concerns about financial considerations are articulated in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness \nto abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about an \nindividual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified or \nsensitive information. Financial distress can also be caused or exacerbated \nby, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other issues of personnel security \nconcern such as excessive gambling, mental health conditions, substance \nmisuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An individual who is financially \noverextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or otherwise \nquestionable acts to generate funds. . . . \nThe Appeal Board explained the scope and rationale for the financial considerations \nsecurity concern in ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012) (citation omitted) \nas follows: \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an applicant might knowingly \ncompromise classified information in order to raise money in satisfaction of \nhis or her debts. Rather, it requires a Judge to examine the totality of an \napplicant\u2019s financial history and circumstances. The Judge must consider \npertinent evidence regarding the applicant\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other \nqualities essential to protecting the national secrets as well as the \nvulnerabilities inherent in the circumstances. The Directive presumes a \nnexus between proven conduct under any of the Guidelines and an \napplicant\u2019s security eligibility. \nGuideline F security concerns are established when an individual does not pay \nfinancial obligations according to terms. One or more of the credit reports in evidence \nestablishes the delinquent debts of concern in the amended SOR (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.g, and \n1.h). Applicant defaulted on the debts in or before 2016. Disqualifying conditions AG \u00b6\u00b6 \n19(a), \u201cinability to satisfy debts,\u201d and 19(c), \u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations,\u201d \napply. \nApplicant has the burdens of production and persuasion in establishing sufficient \nmitigation to overcome the financial concerns raised by his failure to meet some of his \nfinancial obligations according to contractual terms. AG \u00b6 20 provides for mitigation under \none or more of the following conditions: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under \nsuch circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the \nindividual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n17 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; and \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \n \nRegarding AG \u00b6 20(a), the debts are not recent. Even so, they were not resolved \nbefore 2019. Evidence of ongoing delinquency for several years raises concerns about \nApplicant\u2019s financial judgment. The evidence shows that the creditors in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and \n1.g cancelled some or all of Applicant\u2019s debt. He provided evidence that the creditor in \nSOR \u00b6 1.g cancelled $1,436.73 of his debt in April 2019. (AE F.) He testified that he \nresolved the debt balance. A recent credit report from March 2022 (GE 9) still lists the \nbalance as $2,519, but the information reported was as of January 2016. Similarly, he \ntestified that the creditor in SOR \u00b6 1.a also cancelled his debt, and he reported it as income \non his tax returns. The debt is no longer listed on his credit report. Cancellation of debt is \nnot a good-faith effort to resolve debts, but it does appear that the debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and \n1.g are no longer a source of financial pressure for him. AG 20(c) applies to those debts.  \nApplicant showed some good faith under AG \u00b6 20(d) in that he made payments to a \ncollection entity between September 2019 and November 2019, which were accepted in \nsatisfaction of the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.h. A review of Applicant\u2019s recent credit report reflects a \npattern of timely payments on his current accounts. The financial considerations are \nsufficiently mitigated. \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \nThe security concerns about personal conduct are articulated in AG \u00b6 15, which \nprovides as follows: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions about \nan individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified or \nsensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to cooperate or provide \ntruthful and candid answers during national security investigative or \nadjudicative processes. \nRegarding SOR \u00b6 2.a, the evidence establishes that Applicant was arrested for \nsimple assault against his wife, despite his assertions to the contrary. During his March \n18 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nRegarding SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.b and 2.h, the SOR respectively alleges that Applicant was \nterminated from a job after he punched a co-worker in the face, and that he did not \ndisclose on his SF 86 that he was terminated for the incident. He told the OPM investigator \nthat he punched the co-worker during an argument and was questioned about it by police. \nHis present denial that he struck the co-worker and at worst placed his hand on the co-\nworker\u2019s shoulder cannot be reconciled with his previous statement of March 2018. There \nis a reasonable presumption that the investigator accurately reported what Applicant told \nhim or her. Although English is not Applicant\u2019s first language, it was not established that the \ninvestigator misunderstood him, either with respect to the assault on his wife or his former \nco-worker. Applicant asserts that he was an employee of the staffing company and not the \nshipping company and was placed in another position the day after the incident with the co-\nworker. Whether or not he was fired, he left the job under unfavorable circumstances. He \nfalsely indicated on his SF 86 that he left the job when it was completed. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n2018 PSI, he reportedly told the investigator that he struck his spouse because of her \nmarital indiscretions, and that he did not realize at the time that it was unacceptable to \nstrike his wife. The assault charge was nolle prossed, likely because she did not appear in \ncourt. His present assertion that he did nothing more than hug his spouse is not credible. \nAs for Applicant asking for time off because his spouse was going to leave him \nbecause he was not home (SOR \u00b6 2.c) rather than informing his supervisor that he did not \nwant to work in that job, he admitted during his subject interview that he had not been \ncandid with his supervisor about the reason for requested leave. He now asserts that it was \na mix-up and that it was not false because his wife worked a different shift. It is not the \nmost serious of false statements, but it does cast some doubt as to whether his \nrepresentations can reasonably be relied on. Applicant admits that he made false \nstatements when he told the staffing company that he had moved back to Iraq (SOR \u00b6 2.d) \nand that his brother had been killed in an explosion in Iraq (SOR \u00b6 2.e). \nConcerning Applicant\u2019s failure to accurately report his residence from February 2016 \nto November 2016 (SOR \u00b6 2.f), he credibly asserts he did not understand that he had to list \nwhere he was actually residing and not his permanent address. As for his alleged \nemployment terminations for being \u201cno shows\u201d (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.g and 2.i), he admits that he just \nwalked off some jobs that he did not like, but there is no record in evidence to prove he \nwas fired. The personnel record from the employer in SOR \u00b6 2.i indicates only that he was \nplaced in \u201cinactive status.\u201d \nWhile the evidence of intentional falsification is lacking with respect to SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.f, \n2.g., and 2.i, and favorable findings are returned as to those allegations on that basis, \nApplicant\u2019s admissions during his March 2018 PSI to assaultive behavior against his \nspouse (SOR \u00b6 2.a) and a former co-worker (SOR \u00b6 2.b); his lies to his then employer in \n2017 and 2018 about his reasons for requesting leave (SOR \u00b6 2.c), leaving the employ \n(SOR \u00b6 2.d), and more recently for his absence from work to attend his CSS (SOR \u00b6 2.e); \nand his misrepresentation on his SF 86 about the reason for him leaving the work at the \nshipping company (SOR \u00b6 2.h) reflect a pattern of dishonest statements that implicate one \nor more of the following personal conduct security concerns under AG \u00b6 16: \n19 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar \nform used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, \naward benefits or status, determine national security eligibility or \ntrustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities; and \n(d) credible adverse information that is not explicitly covered under any other \nguideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an adverse determination, but \nwhich, when combined with all available information, supports a whole-\nperson \nassessment \nof \nquestionable \njudgment, \nuntrustworthiness, \nunreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and \nregulations, or other characteristics indicating that the individual may not \nproperly safeguard classified or sensitive information. This includes, but is \nnot limited to, consideration of: \n(2) any disruptive, violent, or other inappropriate behavior; and \n(3) a pattern of dishonesty or rule violations. \nThe following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 17 may apply in whole or in part: \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is so \ninfrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is unlikely \nto recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling to \nchange the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the stressors, \ncircumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, unreliable, or \nother inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to recur; and \n(f) the information was unsubstantiated or from a source of questionable \nreliability. \nAG \u00b6 17(a) has some applicability, given Applicant\u2019s admissions during his March \n2018 PSI to the assaultive behaviors and to have falsely told the staffing agency that he \nmoved back to Iraq, and in another instance, that he had to travel to Iraq because his \nbrother had died in an explosion. However, his case in reform is undermined by his present \nclaims that he never struck his wife or his former co-worker. His characterization of his \nfalse statements to his employer as \u201cwhite lies\u201d makes it difficult for me to conclude that his \nrepresentations can be relied on and that the dishonesty he exhibited is unlikely to recur. \n20 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe personal conduct concerns raised by the conduct in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.a through 2.e and 2.h \nare not mitigated. AG \u00b6 17(f) applies as to the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.f, 2.g, and 2.i. \nGuideline B: Foreign Influence \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for foreign influence is articulated in \nAG \u00b6 6: \nForeign contacts and interests, including but not limited to, business, \nfinancial, and property interests, are a national security concern if they result \nin divided allegiance. They may also be a national security concern if they \ncreate circumstances in which the individual may be manipulated or induced \nto help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a way that is \ninconsistent with U.S. interests or otherwise made vulnerable to pressure or \ncoercion by any foreign interest. Assessment of foreign contacts and \ninterests should consider the country in which the foreign contact or interest \nis located, including, but not limited to, considerations such as whether it is \nknown to target U.S. citizens to obtain classified or sensitive information or is \nassociated with a risk of terrorism. \nApplicant\u2019s ten siblings are Iraqi citizens. Brother 1 and sisters 1 and 5 live in Iraq. \nSister 2 lives in Egypt. Sisters 3, 4, 6, and 7, and brothers 2 and 3 reside in the UAE. \nApplicant\u2019s parents-in-law and his spouse\u2019s sisters are Iraqi resident citizens. Her three \nbrothers are Iraqi citizens living in Turkey. Review of Applicant\u2019s contacts and connections \nto these foreign citizens are warranted to determine whether they present a heightened risk \nunder AG \u00b6 7(a) or create a potential conflict of interest under AG \u00b6 7(b). Those \ndisqualifying conditions provide: \n(a) contact, regardless of method, with a foreign family member, business or \nprofessional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or resident \nin a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of foreign \nexploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; and \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual\u2019s obligation to \nprotect classified or sensitive information or technology and the individual\u2019s \ndesire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing that \ninformation or technology. \nNot every foreign contact or tie presents the heightened risk under AG \u00b6 7(a). The \n\u201cheightened risk\u201d denotes a risk greater than the normal risk inherent in having a family \nmember or a spouse\u2019s family member living under a foreign government. The nature and \nstrength of the family ties or other foreign interests and the country involved (i.e., the nature \nof its government, its relationship with the United States, and its human rights record) are \nrelevant in assessing whether there is a likelihood of vulnerability to government coercion. \nThe risk of coercion, persuasion, or duress is significantly greater if the foreign country has \n21 \n\n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nan authoritarian government; a family member is associated with, or dependent on, the \nforeign government; or the country is known to conduct intelligence operations against the \nUnited States. In considering the nature of the foreign government, the administrative judge \nmust also take into account any terrorist activity in the country at issue. See generally ISCR \nCase No. 02-26130 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 7, 2006). \nThere is no evidence that Applicant\u2019s siblings or his spouse\u2019s family members have \nengaged in any activities contrary to U.S. interests or that they have been targeted or \npressured. However, the risk of terrorism is very real, especially in Iraq, Egypt, and Turkey. \nTurkey is a source and transit country for foreign terrorist fighters seeking to join ISIS and \nother terrorist groups fighting in Syria and Iraq, even as it is an active member of the Global \nCoalition to defeat ISIS. All four countries involved (Iraq, Turkey, Egypt, and the UAE) have \nsignificant human rights issues. Although a NATO ally, Turkey does not always act in \naccord with U.S. interests, as evidenced by its acquisition of Russian S-400 surface-to-air \nmissile system, despite the availability of alternative, NATO-interoperable systems to meet \nits defense requirements. Egypt has been implicated in recent economic and technological \nespionage against the United States. U.S. dual-use goods and technology, including \nmilitary and electronic components and Internet technology, have passed through the UAE \nand UAE-owned businesses to destinations such as Iran and Syria. Applicant\u2019s brother #1 \nworks for Iraq\u2019s government. It is conceivable that pressure could be brought to bear on \nApplicant through his or his spouse\u2019s family members to obtain sensitive information. AG \n\u00b6\u00b6 7(a) and 7(b) apply \nThree mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 8 warrant some discussion in this case. \nThey are: \n(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in which \nthese persons are located, or the positions or activities of those persons in \nthat country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be placed in a \nposition of having to choose between the interests of a foreign individual, \ngroup, organization, or government and the interests of the United States; \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of \nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, or allegiance to the group, \ngovernment, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such deep and \nlongstanding relationships and loyalties in the United States, that the \nindividual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the \nU.S. interest; and \n(c) contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and infrequent \nthat there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign influence or \nexploitation. \nAG \u00b6 8(a) cannot reasonably apply. There is nothing about the occupations of \nApplicant\u2019s or his spouse\u2019s family members that raises a particular concern, except \nperhaps his brother 1, who works for Iraq\u2019s government. Not enough is known about this \n22 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nbrother\u2019s position or activities to allay the concern that his government employment \nheightens the risk. Sister 3 is the only sister who works outside the home, and she is an \nelementary school teacher in the UAE. Applicant\u2019s father-in-law previously worked for the \nIraqi police, but his employment ended in 2005. The risk of indiscriminate acts of terrorism \nand the human rights issues in all four countries preclude full mitigation under AG \u00b6 8(a). \nApplicant has a case for some mitigation under AG \u00b6 8(b). There is no evidence that \nhe has any loyalty to his native Iraq. To the contrary, his desire to continue to work as a \nlinguist for the U.S. government is consistent with allegiance to his adopted homeland the \nUnited States. He, his spouse, and older daughter were taken in as refugees. They have \nacquired U.S. citizenship by naturalization and possess U.S. passports. Applicant\u2019s \nyounger daughter is a U.S. citizen from birth. Applicant and his spouse own their home in \nthe United States, and they have jobs in the United States. By all accounts, their lives are \nhere. There is no indication that they intend to reside permanently elsewhere. \nRegarding AG \u00b6 8(c), there is no evidence that Applicant has had any contact with \nany of his siblings or his spouse\u2019s family since 2019. He testified that he ended the \ncontacts and financial support when he began working as a linguist for the U.S. \ngovernment and realized his ongoing contacts with his and his spouse\u2019s relatives could \npose a problem. He asks the Government to believe that he ended his contacts and \nfinancial support abruptly, without explaining to his relatives the reason why. Concerns \nabout his candor because of his pattern of misrepresentations are not a substitute for \nrecord evidence. Even if he has not had any contact with his or his spouse\u2019s relatives since \n2019, it is unclear that his spouse has ended her contacts with her family. Applicant \nadmitted at his hearing that he does not know when his spouse last talked to her family in \nIraq. \nMoreover, Applicant had contact with his relatives even after he told the OPM \ninvestigator in March 2018 that, as of February 2018, he and his spouse agreed that they \nare no longer allowed to talk to family members; that his spouse felt that he revealed too \nmuch about their personal lives to his family and \u201cthey want to borrow money because they \nknow too much.\u201d  He maintained contact with some family members to at least 2019. He \nvisited with some of them in the UAE in 2019. After considering all the facts and \ncircumstances, the risk of undue foreign influence is not fully mitigated. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of his conduct and \nall relevant circumstances in light of the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 \n2(d). Those factors are as follows: \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances \nsurrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the \nfrequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at \nthe time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which participation is voluntary; (6) \n23 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \nthe presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral \nchanges; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, \ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or \nrecurrence. \nApplicant earned the respect and appreciation of the U.S. military officers who \nbenefitted from his translation services during a training mission overseas. His service on \nbehalf of the U.S. military certainly reflects positively on him. Yet, considerable doubts \npersist as to whether he can be counted on to fulfill his obligations without regard to his \nself-interest. He did not display professionalism when he walked off jobs because he did \nnot like them. He has a troubling record of misrepresenting the facts when it is in his self-\ninterest to do so. \nFurthermore, in foreign influence cases. it must be acknowledged that people act in \nunpredictable ways when faced with choices that could be important to a family member. \nAs reiterated by the Appeal Board in ISCR Case No. 19-01688 at 5 (App. Bd. Aug. 10, \n2020), \u201cApplication of the guidelines is not a comment on an applicant\u2019s patriotism but \nmerely an acknowledgment that people may act in unpredictable ways when faced with \nchoices that could be important to a loved-one, such as a family member.\u201d \nIt is well settled that once a concern arises regarding an applicant\u2019s security \nclearance eligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or renewal of a security \nclearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th Cir. 1990). Based on the \nevidence of record, it is not clearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant \nor continue security clearance eligibility for Applicant. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the amended \nSOR, as required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 1.a: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.b-1.f: \nWithdrawn \nSubparagraphs 1.g-1.h: \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline E: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 2.a-2.e: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 2.f-2.g: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 2.h: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 2.i: \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 3, Guideline B: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n24 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n_____________________ \nSubparagraph 3.a:  \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 3.b-3.j: \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances, it is not clearly consistent with the interests of \nnational security to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance.

On January 25, 2022, the Defense Office of Hearings \nand Appeals (DOHA) issued a Notice of Hearing, setting it for February 22, 2022. The \nhearing was held in person as scheduled. \nAt the commencement of the hearing, Department Counsel offered Government \nExhibits (GE) 1 through 7 into evidence. GE 1, 2, 3, and 7 were admitted into evidence. \nThe Government offered three exhibits that were Administrative Notice requests for three \ncountries: Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan (GE 4); United Arab Emirates (GE 5); and The \nRussian Federation (GE 6). Applicant objected to GE 4 because he believed the \ndocuments had incomplete information. The facts detailed in GE 4 are drawn from official \nU.S. Government publications. The motion for administrative notice of GE 4 is granted. \nBased on Applicant\u2019s lack of connections to the United Arab Emirates and The Russian \nFederal, discussed infra, it was unnecessary to take administrative notice of facts relating \nto the United Arab Emirates and The Russian Federation. GE 5 and GE 6 are attached \nto the record for appellate purposes. \nApplicant submitted Applicant Exhibits (AE) A through G into evidence. \nDepartment Counsel objected to AE D, which Applicant submitted in response to the GE \n4 and GE 5. All of Applicant\u2019s exhibits were admitted. The record closed at the conclusion \nof the hearing.

He stated that his father was deceased, his \nmother is a U.S. permanent resident, and his brother is a dual citizen of Jordan and \nGermany, and resides in Germany. He said one of his sisters is married and lives in Qatar. \nIn response to the allegation in SOR \u00b6 1.b, he said one sister resides in the United Arab \nEmirates (UAE). \nApplicant\u2019s father was born in Jordan. He is deceased. He was a school teacher \nin Jordan. His mother was born in Jordan. She is a U.S. permanent resident, but now \nresides in Jordan. Sometimes he communicates with her every other day and sometimes \nnot for a couple months. He uses social media and the telephone to contact her. The last \ntime he saw his mother was in November 2017, when he flew to Jordan for his father\u2019s \nfuneral. He stayed there about a month. He has no plans to return. (Tr. 44-46; GE 1) \nApplicant has two brothers. Both were born in Jordan. His brother R resides in the \nUnited States. He is married to a U.S. citizen. He thinks R may be a U.S. citizen now. His \nother brother F married a German woman and now resides in Germany. The last time he \nhad contact with F was when they attended his father\u2019s funeral in 2017. (Tr. 47-48; GE 1) \nApplicant has two sisters. Both were born in Jordan. His sister RE is a Jordanian \ncitizen and resident. She is a hair stylist. Sometimes he speaks to RE if she is visiting his \nmother when he calls. He spoke to her about three weeks before his hearing. (Tr. 51-51) \nApplicant\u2019s sister RA is a Jordanian citizen and resident. She previously resided in the \nUAE, but now lives with their mother in Jordan and takes care of her. She worked in a \nschool system in the UAE. He communicates with her by email and speaks to her when \nhe calls his mother. She would like to obtain a visa to visit him in the United States. He \nstayed with her in the UAE when he visited periodically. He does not provide financial \nsupport to any family member residing in Jordan. (Tr. 49-54) He stayed at his father\u2019s \nhouse with his mother and the brother from the United States when he visited for his \nfather\u2019s funeral. (Tr. 56) Applicant reported that between 2002 and 2017, he frequently \nvisited his family in Jordan and his sister RA in the UAE. (Ex. 3) \nI take administrative notice of the facts about Jordan that are set forth on pages 2 \nthrough 4 of GE 4, which are drawn from official U.S. Government publications. These \ninclude that Jordan is a constitutional monarchy ruled by King Abdullah II bin Hussein, \nwho appoints members of their House of Representatives and Senate. Jordan continues \nto encounter terrorism due to its borders\u2019 proximity to Lebanon and Syria, where \nnumerous groups have conducted attacks into it. Jordan\u2019s participation in the global \ncoalition to defeat ISIS increases its potential for terrorist incidents. Certain regions in the \ncountry hold anti-Western sentiments and protest the United States\u2019 policies on Israel. \nSignificant human rights violations are prevalent in the country, many of which are not \nprosecuted.

He claims he started that relationship after \nhis brother F (who now resides in Germany), related information to him about issues in \nthe Middle East that Applicant thought would be of interest to the [U.S. agency]. (Tr. 65, \n71-72) \nApplicant admits that between July 2016 and January 2017, he had a relationship \nwith [a woman], a Russian citizen, whom he met in [redacted] while he was on vacation. \nThey were staying at the same hotel. He was on his way to see his sister RA in the UAE, \nwhen his flight had a 24-hour layover. He stayed with RA a few times over the next several \nmonths as he traveled between Amman, Jordan, and the United States. He spent time \nwith [the woman who is a Russian citizen] over those months. In January 2017, [the \nwoman who is a Russian citizen] flew to the United States and stayed with him at his \nhome. Months later she obtained a position with a U.S. university. (Tr. 58-62) \nApplicant explained that [the woman who is a Russian citizen] worked for a U.S. \ncompany in Russia on a project at a Russian academy. She has advanced degrees in \nscience. She was a \u201cperson of interest\u201d to Applicant. (Answer) He told [Mr.] N about [the \nwoman who is a Russian citizen] after meeting her. He said that [Mr.] N became interested \nin [the woman who is a Russian citizen] and the \u201cscientists she works with in Russia.\u201d (Tr. \n103; AE E) Applicant said [the woman who is a Russian citizen] bragged about her work \nin Russia. (Tr. 61) Applicant admitted that he had an intimate relationship with [the woman \nwho is a Russian citizen]. However, he considered her a \u201csubject\u201d from whom to gather \ninformation for [Mr.] N. (Tr. 68) \nApplicant\u2019s last communication with [the woman who is a Russian citizen] was in \nJanuary 2017, when she visited him in the United States. (Tr. 58-62,102; GE 2 at 13) He \nsaid that while she was staying with him, he broke into her email without her authorization \nand forwarded some emails to [Mr.] N. He claimed he took pictures of some of her \ninformation and sent it to [Mr.] N. (Tr. 90) \nIn his November 18, 2020 Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted that he had a \nrelationship with [the woman who is a Russian citizen], as alleged in SOR \u00b6 2.a. He denied \nthat he intentionally withheld information about it to the government, as alleged in \u00b6 2.b, \nand stated he did not report it because he did not have a \u201ccontinuing\u201d relationship with \n[the woman who is a Russian citizen]. (Tr. 104) He admitted that during his June 2017 \ninterview he failed to disclose to an Office of Personnel Management (OPM) investigator \nthat he had made lasting contacts with a non-U.S. citizen while traveling out of the \ncountry, as alleged in \u00b6 2.c.

He was upset that his friend told the OPM investigator about his Russian girlfriend. \n(Tr. 76-80) \nWhen asked by an OPM investigator during his second background interview in \nJuly 2017, why he did not disclose information about [the woman who is a Russian citizen] \nin his security forms, Applicant said he initially disclosed her name to a U.S. Embassy in \nthe Middle East in July 2016. He said he also met with a second U.S. government agency \nin a large city and was told not to disclose his relationship with anyone else, including in \nhis security clearance forms. (GE 2 at 13) \nApplicant submitted exhibits of emails to and from [Mr.] N as proof of his \nrelationship with [Mr.] N. (AE B) He did not present evidence from [Mr.] N or the second \nU.S. government agency with whom he allegedly he met to corroborate his claims that he \nwas instructed not to disclose his contacts with [the woman who is a Russian citizen]. He \nmaintained that his briefings and communications with [Mr. N] were obvious proof of the \nrelationship. (Tr. 87-88) \nAlthough [the woman] is a Russian citizen, I find that the specific identity and \ncharacteristics of the foreign country involved in this case are not relevant to evaluating \nApplicant\u2019s intentional concealment of their relationship. I find that his intense interest in \nworking with a U.S. [redacted] agency was his motivation for deceiving the government. \nHence, the information in the Administrative Notice Request for The Federation of Russia \n(GE 6) is not material to resolving the Guideline E security allegations. \nGuideline J: Criminal Conduct \nApplicant admitted the allegation in SOR \u00b6 3.a, pertinent to his 2019 criminal \nconviction. (AE F) \nIn May 2014, Applicant became embroiled in a violent physical altercation with his \ndaughter and her boyfriend at his daughter\u2019s apartment. Applicant said his ex-wife told \nhim that the boyfriend was dangerous and was involved in drugs. During the fight, he \nseriously injured the boyfriend. At some point Applicant left the apartment. Subsequently, \na warrant for his arrest was issued. (Answer) Applicant denied that he was the aggressor \nin the fight, despite multiple witnesses\u2019 statements. (Tr. 95) \nApplicant said he did not know about the warrant until January 2019, when he was \nstopped by the police for a traffic violation. At that time, he had been working for the TSA \nsince September 2018. He was subsequently fired by the agency. (Tr. 95-97; Answer) \nOn October 22, 2019, Applicant was convicted by a jury of three felony counts of \naggravated assault in connection with the May 2014 incident.

(Tr. 168) \nApplicant submitted letters of recommendation, awards, and certificates of \nappreciation that he has received over the years. Several people with whom Applicant \nworked while he was a linguist in the 2000\u2019s commented on his strengths and abilities. \n(AE G) \nPolicies \nThis national security eligibility action was taken under Executive Order 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; \nDOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program \n(January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the National Security Adjudicative \nGuidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information or Eligibility to \nHold a Sensitive Position (AG), which became effective within DOD on June 8, 2017. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility, the administrative judge \nmust consider the AG. In addition to brief introductory explanations for each guideline, \nthe AG list potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used \nin evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known \nas the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere \nspeculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 states an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d \n6 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nFinally, as emphasized in Section 7 of EO 10865, [a]ny determination under this \norder adverse to an applicant shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline B: Foreign Influence \nAG \u00b6 6 describes the security concerns regarding foreign influence: \nForeign contacts and interests, including, but not limited to, business, \nfinancial and property interests, are a national security concern if they result \nin divided allegiance. They may also be a national security concern if they \ncreate circumstances in which the individual may be manipulated or induced \nto help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a way \ninconsistent with U.S. interests or otherwise made vulnerable to pressure \nor coercion by any foreign interest. Assessment of foreign contacts and \ninterests should consider the country in which the foreign contact or interest \nis located, including, but not limited to, considerations such as whether it is \nknown to target U.S. citizens to obtain classified or sensitive information or \nis associated with a risk of terrorism. \nAG \u00b6 7 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying in this case. Two of them are potentially applicable: \n(a) contact, regardless of method, with a foreign family member, business \nor professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or \nresident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of \nforeign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; and \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual\u2019s obligation to \nprotect classified or sensitive information or technology and the individual\u2019s \ndesire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing that \ninformation or technology. \n7 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \nThe mere possession of close family ties with a person who is a citizen of, or has \nclose family members residing in a foreign country, is not, as a matter of law, disqualifying \nunder Guideline B. However, if only one relative lives in a foreign country and an applicant \nhas contacts with that relative, this factor alone is sufficient to create the potential for \nforeign influence and could potentially result in the compromise of classified information. \nSee ISCR Case No. 03-02382 at 5 (App. Bd. Feb. 15, 2006); ISCR Case No. 99-0424 \n(App. Bd. Feb. 8, 2001). \nApplicant has normal and familial connections with his mother. She has U.S. \npermanent resident status, but currently resides in Jordan. He maintains contact with her; \nwith his sister RE, who is a resident and citizen of Jordan; and with his sister RA, who is \na citizen and now also a resident of Jordan. These relationships create a heightened risk \nof foreign pressure, coercion, and exploitation because there are multiple regions in \nJordan, including near its borders, where groups hold strong anti-Western sentiments and \nhave been involved in terrorism. Significant human rights\u2019 violations are prevalent in the \ncountry and crowded areas are subject to criminal activity. \nApplicant\u2019s ongoing relationships with his mother and two sisters create a potential \nconflict of interest between his obligation to protect sensitive information or technology \nand his desire to help family members, should they be pressured, manipulated, or \notherwise induced to obtain access to such information. The evidence is sufficient to raise \nthese disqualifying conditions, shifting the burden to Applicant to prove mitigation. \nApplicant\u2019s brother F no longer resides in Jordan. He now resides in Germany. \nSecurity concerns alleged about his citizenship and residency are mitigated. \nAG \u00b6 8 lists six conditions that could mitigate foreign influence security concerns. \nThose with potential application in mitigating the security concerns in this case are: \n(a) the nature of the relationship with foreign persons, the country in which \nthese persons are located, or the positions or activities of those persons in \nthat country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be placed in a \nposition of having to choose between the interests of a foreign individual, \ngroup, organization, or government and the interests of the United States; \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of \nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, or allegiance to the group, \ngovernment, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such deep and \nlongstanding relationships and loyalties in the United States, that the \nindividual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the \nU.S. interest; and \n(c) contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and \ninfrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign \ninfluence or exploitation. \n8 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \nApplicant did not establish that it is unlikely that he could be placed in a position of \nhaving to choose between the interests of a foreign individual or government and those \nof the United States, as a consequence of his mother\u2019s and sister RE\u2019s residence in \nJordan, and more recently his sister RA\u2019s residence in Jordan. Those connections create \ncontinuing and a significant potential for conflict of interest and risk of coercion, \nexploitation, or pressure. Although Applicant established connections to the United States \nsince arriving here in 1990, including owning a home, attending college, and working as \na linguist for American troops in the early 2000\u2019s, he frequently returned to Jordan and \nthe UAE between 2002 and 2017 for family visits, demonstrating his ongoing Jordanian \nattachments. He maintains frequent contact with his mother and sisters who reside in \nJordan. On balance, the evidence demonstrates heightened risk of foreign coercive \nexploitation, and significant potential for a conflict of interest. Accordingly, Applicant failed \nto establish substantial mitigation with respect to those relationships under AG \u00b6\u00b6 8(a), \n(b), or (c). \nGuideline E: Personal Conduct \nAG \u00b6 15 explains the security concerns relating to personal conduct: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. The following will normally result in \nan unfavorable national security eligibility determination, security clearance \naction, or cancellation of further processing for national security eligibility: \n(a) refusal, or failure without reasonable cause, to undergo or cooperate \nwith security processing, including but not limited to meeting with a security \ninvestigator for subject interview, completing security forms or releases, \ncooperation with medical or psychological evaluation, or polygraph \nexamination, if authorized and required; and \n(b) refusal to provide full, frank, and truthful answers to lawful questions of \ninvestigators, security officials, or other official representatives in \nconnection with a personnel security or trustworthiness determination. \nAG \u00b6 16 describes two conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying in this case. They include: \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar \nform used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, \naward benefits or status, determine national security eligibility or \ntrustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities; and \n9 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(b) deliberately providing false or misleading information; or concealing or \nomitting information, concerning relevant facts to an employer, investigator, \nsecurity official, competent medical or mental health professional involved \nin making a recommendation relevant to a national security eligibility \ndetermination, or other official government representative. \nThe evidence establishes the above two disqualifying conditions. Between July \n2016 and January 2017, Applicant intentionally engaged in an intimate and personal \nrelationship with a woman whom he knew was a foreign national. He claims that he \ninitiated that relationship because he believed she could provide him information that may \nbe of interest to [Mr.] N., an alleged [employee] with another U.S. government agency \nwith whom he had been interacting since 2015 due to [redacted] leads passed on by his \nbrother. He also claims that he first met [the woman who is a Russian citizen] when he \nwas staying in a [redacted] hotel during a 24-hour flight layover while traveling to visit his \nsister in the UAE. \nWhen he completed Section 19-Foreign Contacts of his May 2017 SCA, Applicant \ndid not disclose [the woman who is a Russian citizen], as a foreign national with whom \nhe had recently been involved for four months. In his November 2019 Answer to the \nallegation in \u00b6 2.b, referencing his omission, he claimed he did not reveal the relationship \nbecause he was not in a \u201ccontinuing\u201d relationship with her, which he interpreted to mean \nongoing and into the present. \nApplicant\u2019s explanation is not believable, given he had been in contact with an \nalleged [employee (Mr. N)] since 2015, and his specific purpose in establishing a \nrelationship with [the woman who is a Russian citizen] in March 2016 was to obtain \ninformation and pass it on to [Mr.] N. He continued seeing [the woman who is a Russian \ncitizen] into January 2017, about four months before he submitted his SCA. He did not \nwant to disclose the relationship, so he intentionally chose not to disclose the information. \nDuring his June 2017 OPM interview, Applicant denied having had close or \ncontinuing contact with any non-U.S. citizen during his international travel in 2016 and \n2017. During his subsequent interview in July 2017, the OPM investigator asked him if he \nhad dated anyone from Russia. He then disclosed his relationship with [the woman who \nis a Russian citizen]. He told the investigator that he did not disclose the relationship \nbecause an [employee] with another U.S. government agency told him not to disclose it. \nHe did not submit credible proof that a legitimate U.S. agency directed him to not disclose \nhis relationship during his security clearance investigation. He intentionally failed to \ndisclose requested information during his June 2017 OPM interview. \nAG \u00b6 17 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns and include: \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; \n(b) the refusal or failure to cooperate, omission, or concealment was caused \nor significantly contributed to by advice of legal counsel or of a person with \n10 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nprofessional responsibilities for advising or instructing the individual \nspecifically concerning security processes. Upon being made aware of the \nrequirement to cooperate or provide the information, the individual \ncooperated fully and truthfully; and \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment. \nApplicant did not voluntarily disclose his relationship with [the woman who is a \nRussian citizen] prior to being confronted with the information in July 2017, by an OPM \ninvestigator who had learned of it through Applicant\u2019s friend. Applicant\u2019s non-disclosure \nwas not a minor infraction but significant and repetitive. It is aggravated by his assertion \nthat he intentionally initiated a relationship with [the woman who is a Russian citizen] \nbecause she was a foreign national, and he believed she could have important \ninformation for his contact with another U.S. government agency. Applicant persistently \nstressed that he worked with two U.S. government agencies, and was directed by them \nnot to disclose this requested information during the security clearance process. There is \nno substantive evidence to verify his highly unlikely assertions. The evidence does not \nestablish mitigation under the above three mitigating conditions. The personal conduct \nsecurity concerns are not mitigated. \nGuideline J: Criminal Conduct \nAG \u00b6 30 sets out the security concern related to criminal conduct: \nCriminal activity creates doubt about a person's judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person's ability \nor willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations. \nAG \u00b6 31 lists conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. They include: \n(b) evidence (including, but not limited to, a credible allegation, an \nadmission, and matters of official record) of criminal conduct, regardless of \nwhether the individual was formally charged, prosecuted, or convicted; and \n(c) individual is currently on parole or probation. \nOn October 22, 2019, Applicant was convicted of three felonies involving \naggravated assault. On January 9, 2020, he was sentenced to 120 days of confinement \nand placed on supervised probation for four years. He remains on probation as of his \nhearing. The evidence establishes both of the above disqualifying conditions. \n11 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 32 describes two conditions that could mitigate security concerns raised \nunder this guideline: \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur and \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; and \n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including, but not limited \nto, the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, restitution, \ncompliance with the terms of parole or probation, job training or higher \neducation, \ngood \nemployment \nrecord, \nor \nconstructive \ncommunity \ninvolvement. \nThere is insufficient evidence to establish mitigation under either of the above two \nconditions. Sufficient time has not passed because Applicant remains on a four-year \nsupervised probation until January 2024. There is minimal evidence that since January \n2020, he has been in compliance with all terms of his probation, or that he has established \na good employment record and/or other evidence of rehabilitation since then. The criminal \nconduct security concerns are not mitigated. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), \u201c[t]he ultimate determination\u201d of whether to grant a security \nclearance \u201cmust be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines\u201d and the whole-person concept. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuidelines B, E, and J under this whole-person analysis. However, one further concern \nrequires mentioning, and that is Applicant\u2019s insistence that he did not intentionally withhold \ninformation about [the woman who is a Russian citizen] when he submitted his May 2017 \nSCA and during his June 2017 interview. This record does not contain sufficient evidence \nto find that anyone from a U.S. government agency directed Applicant to deceive the DoD \nduring the security clearance process. Without such verifiable evidence of those \nassertions and associations, Applicant\u2019s credibility and veracity remain a serious concern. \n12 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n     Against Applicant \n                                           Against Applicant \n \n \n \n           Paragraph 2, Guideline E:                                   AGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \n \n     Against Applicant \n                                      Against Applicant \n                                         Against Applicant \n \n \n \n                                AGAINST A\n PPLICANT \n \n                Subparagraph 3.a:                                             Against Applicant \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n____________________ \nHe failed to mitigate the security concerns raised under the guidelines for foreign \ninfluence, personal conduct, and criminal conduct. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline B:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT  \nSubparagraph 1.a: \nSubparagraph 1.b:   \nSubparagraph 2.a: \nSubparagraph 2.b:        \nSubparagraph 2.c:     \nParagraph 3, Guideline J:    \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for access to \nclassified information.

National security eligibility for access to classified information \nis granted. \nHistory of the Case \nApplicant submitted a security clearance application (SCA) on August 15, 2018. \nOn October 15, 2019, the Department of Defense (DOD) Consolidated Adjudications \nFacility (CAF) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) alleging security concerns under \nGuideline F (financial considerations). Applicant answered the SOR on November 26, \n2019, and requested a hearing before an administrative judge (Answer). The case was \nassigned to me on June 3, 2020, but the hearing was delayed due to the COVID-19 \npandemic. On March 3, 2021, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) \nnotified Applicant that the hearing was scheduled for April 13, 2021. On April 8, 2021, \nApplicant\u2019s counsel entered his appearance and requested a continuance.

He \nwas previously married and divorced two times (September 2006 to April 2007 and \nSeptember 2008 to March 2013). He has a ten-year-old daughter with his second wife \nand an almost seven-year old daughter and a four-year-old son with his current partner. \nShe has a 13-year-old daughter from previous relationship who lives with them. (GE 1; \nTr. at 10-12, 104) \nApplicant received an associate\u2019s degree in general studies in 2010 and a \nbachelor\u2019s degree in business administration in 2012. Between 2008 and 2017, he \nworked as a dual-status technician, serving in the Army National Guard (ARNG) and as \na civilian employee for the Department of the Army (DOA).

(GE 1; Tr. at 10-12, 25-26, 79, \n86-87, 112-113) \nApplicant\u2019s multiple ARNG deployments negatively affected his second marriage, \nand his oldest daughter was less than a year old when he deployed to Iraq for a year-\nlong tour. Applicant and his second wife divorced in 2013 following his return from a\ndeployment, and he was court-ordered to pay $1,200 monthly in child support for his\noldest daughter.

(GE 1; Tr. 27-31, 104-105) \nShortly after his second divorce, Applicant entered into a relationship with his \ncurrent partner. Her daughter lived with them, and his partner did not work outside their \nhome. He supported them financially, as well as his daughter from his second marriage. \nBecause he was responsible for all of the debt from his last relationship, he was only able \nto tread water financially. Applicant\u2019s middle daughter was born during this period, further \nstraining their finances. In 2017, when the Army told him that he was going to deploy \nagain, this time to Afghanistan, Applicant chose to leave the ARNG. He was unemployed \nfor a 9-month period from August 2017 to April 2018. When he regained part-time \nemployment in April 2018, he earned only $10 an hour until August 2018. (Tr. 28-30, 90-\n91) \nPrior to his unemployment, Applicant earned approximately $60,000 annually as \ndual-status technician. His civilian job with the DOA was tied to his service in the ARNG. \nWhen he left the ARNG, he also lost his job with the DOA. Prior to leaving the ARNG and \nDOA, Applicant filed for Chapter 13 bankruptcy protection in August 2016. He made \npayments according to the scheduled payment plan until 2018, when he was no longer \nable to make the full payments due to his lack of income. (GE 1 \u2013 GE 5; Tr. 30-31, 74-82) \nAll three of Applicant\u2019s biological children are disabled in some capacity, as is his \nstepdaughter, who receives Social Security benefits. Due to their children\u2019s disabilities, \nhis partner is unable to work outside of their home. (Tr. 99-100, 113, 115) \nThe mortgage debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.a, for Applicant\u2019s former home, became \ndelinquent in 2014, when he stopped making payments following his second divorce. He \nresided in the home for approximately 4 years without making payments; however, the \nmortgage was included in his 2016 Chapter 13 bankruptcy plan. The home was \nforeclosed upon in 2018, and sold in 2019. Multiple credit reports in the record reflect that \nthe current balance is $0. Applicant had no additional tax obligations related to this debt. \n(See Chart) \nApplicant\u2019s child-support obligations for his oldest daughter became delinquent \nduring the period when he and his wife were separated in 2013, prior to the finalization of \ntheir divorce, and when he was unemployed for nine months in 2017 and 2018. The debt \nalleged in SOR \u00b6 1.c reflects the arrears that accumulated during the period that he was \nunable to pay. Since regaining employment, Applicant has been making his court-ordered \npayments plus $100 monthly arrearage payments. These payments are automatically \ndeducted from his paychecks.

(See Chart) \nIn March 2021, Applicant contacted the creditor for SOR \u00b6 1.k. He originally \nopened this credit card in 2007, and it became delinquent in 2014; however, when he \ncontacted the creditor, it had no record of his account or his social security number. He \nhas not used this account in over ten years. He has the means to pay this debt, but due \nto a lack of information was unable to make a payment. (See Chart) \nWhen Applicant filed for Chapter 13 bankruptcy protection in August 2016, he was \nearning $60,000 annually. He made 16 monthly payments of $152, per the payment plan. \nAfter 16 payments, the monthly payment amount increased to $366. However, at the time \nthat the monthly payments increased, he was unemployed. He continued to make \npayments of $152 for three or four months, until the bankruptcy was dismissed in April \n2018. He paid a total of approximately $3,000 to the trustees of the bankruptcy. Applicant \ncould not afford to refile for bankruptcy after it was dismissed.

He \nborrowed money from his partner\u2019s parents to drive himself across the country. After \nrepaying his partner\u2019s parents, he saved approximately $10,000 in emergency funds; \nhowever, he was also supporting two households while working in State A, which limited \nhis ability to repay his delinquent debts. (Tr. 91-97) \nAlthough Applicant earned $94,000 annually at his position in State A, he left after \nonly a few months due to the high cost of living in the area. He then took a job in the \nMidwest, where the cost of living was significantly lower. His partner and their children \nmoved to live with him, further reducing their expenses. He worked for this employer for \ntwo years, and earned approximately $104,000 annually. (Tr. 91-97) \nApplicant was interviewed by a Government investigator in January 2019, and \nconfronted with his delinquent debts. He acknowledged that he wanted to pay and resolve \nhis debts but did not have the capability at that time to pay them. In August 2020, \nApplicant started working for his current employer, a Defense contractor, and at the time \nof the hearing, he was earning $200,000 annually. In 2020, after he started earning a \nhigher salary, Applicant started making payments toward his delinquent debts using the \n\u201csnowball method\u201d to resolve his smallest debts first. He paid and resolved debts that \nwere not alleged in the SOR. (GE 5; Tr. 32-34, 91-97) \nBased upon the recommendation of his counsel, Applicant used his emergency \nsavings to resolve several of the SOR allegations in March and April 2021, shortly before \nthe hearing. Prior to this recommendation, Applicant had relied upon his understanding \nthat the statute of limitations (SOL) for delinquent debts in his former state of residence \nwas three years; therefore, many of the debts alleged in the SOR were no longer \nenforceable. At the time of the hearing, after paying his delinquent debts, he had \napproximately $60,000 in combined savings, checking, and investment accounts. (GE 8; \nAE A; AE O; AE N; Tr. 85, 106-109) \nApplicant timely filed his state and federal income tax returns shortly before the \nhearing and owed approximately $200 and $1,000, respectively, and had the resources \nand intent to pay both entities. He received credit counseling through his bankruptcy, did \nresearch online, listened to the advice of one of his non-commissioned officers (NCO), \nand read and followed Dave Ramsey\u2019s materials. He utilizes a written budget to track his \nbills and expenses. He has almost $7,000 of disposable monthly income, $5,000 of which \nhe routinely saves. His most recent credit reports indicate no new delinquent debts, and \nall of his previous delinquent debts became delinquent during his divorce or during his \nperiod of unemployment and underemployment. (GE 4; GE 8; AE A; AE O; AE N; Tr. 85, \n106-109) \nApplicant provided copies of his NCO evaluation reports between 2010 and 2016. \nHe was consistently described as knowledgeable, prepared, a team player, and a leader. \nHis record included the following awards and decorations while serving in the ARNG: \nArmy Achievement Medal (second award); Army Good Conduct Medal; and NCO of the \nQuarter.

(AE P, AE Q; Tr. 116-117) \nPolicies \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG), which became \neffective on June 8, 2017. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in conjunction \nwith the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation of potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nThe concern under Guideline F (Financial considerations) is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds . . . .   \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified information to raise money. It encompasses concerns about a \nperson\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting classified \ninformation. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information. \nThe record evidence of Applicant\u2019s delinquent debts establishes the following \ndisqualifying condition under AG \u00b6 19: \u201c(a) inability to satisfy debts\u201d; and (c) a history of \nnot meeting financial obligations. \nAG \u00b6 20 describes conditions that could mitigate security concerns. The following \nare potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control;  \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue. \nThe debts alleged in the SOR became delinquent after Applicant\u2019s 2013 divorce \nand during his period of unemployment from 2017 to 2018. His credit reports reflect no \nnew additional delinquent debts, which is some indication his financial problems occurred \nduring circumstances that are unlikely to recur and do not cast doubt on his current \nreliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. \nApplicant went through a divorce after returning from an overseas deployment. As \na result of the divorce, he was required to pay $1,200 monthly in child support and assume \nresponsibility for all of the marital debt. Shortly after his divorce, he entered into a new \nrelationship with his current partner, and together they had additional children. All of \nApplicant\u2019s biological children and his stepdaughter have disabilities, requiring his partner \nto care for them full time. As a result of his financial strains, he filed for Chapter 13 \nBankruptcy protection in 2016, and he made payments for over a year until his lack of \nincome and the increased monthly payments became unaffordable because he was \nunemployed. Applicant chose to leave his position as a dual-status technician for the DOA \nand ARNG in 2017, due to multiple deployments and the negative affect on his family. He \nthen struggled to regain fulltime employment for over a year. \nThe conditions and circumstances stated above were beyond Applicant\u2019s control, \nand once he regained employment, he worked to establish an emergency savings \naccount to prevent future financial problems; however, he did little to resolve many of his \ndelinquent consumer debts until shortly before the hearing. He testified that this was due \nto his reliance upon his former state\u2019s three-year SOL regarding enforceability of \ndelinquent debts. Once he attorney recommended that he resolve his debts, he used his \nsavings to resolve and pay most of the debts alleged in the SOR. \nApplicant\u2019s paychecks are being garnished to pay his child support obligations. \nAlthough he still owes an outstanding balance for this debt, he is making payments as \nreflected in the record evidence. His federal student loans were consolidated in January \n2020. He made two payments prior to the enactment of the CARES Act in March 2020. \nHe has the means and the ability to repay this debt, and his actions in 2020 demonstrate \na willingness to repay this debt. There is some evidence of credit counseling in the record. \nApplicant follows a written budget and has savings further reflecting responsible financial \nbehavior. \nApplicant could have done more earlier to resolve the debts alleged in the SOR; \nhowever, based on his track record of paying his debts, I believe he will continue to pay \nand resolve his child support and student loan obligations.

Under all the circumstances, he established \nmitigation of financial considerations security concerns \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the potentially \ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and circumstances \nsurrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-\nperson analysis. I conclude Applicant has met his burden of proof and persuasion. He \nmitigated the financial considerations security concerns and established his eligibility for \na security clearance. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.o:   \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nI conclude that it is clearly consistent with the interests of national security of the \nUnited States to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s national security eligibility for access to \nclassified information. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nCAROLINE E. HEINTZELMAN \nAdministrative Judge \n11 \n",

(Government Exhibit \n(GE) 1) On November 30, 2021, the Defense Counterintelligence and Security Agency \n(DCSA) Consolidated Adjudications Facility (CAF) issued a statement of reasons (SOR) \nto Applicant under Executive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry (February 20, 1960); Department of Defense (DOD) Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (Directive) \n(January 2, 1992), as amended; and Security Executive Agent Directive 4, establishing \nin Appendix A, the National Security Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for \nAccess to Classified Information or Eligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position (AGs), effective \nJune 8, 2017. (Hearing Exhibit (HE) 2) \nThe SOR detailed reasons why the DCSA CAF did not find under the Directive that \nit is clearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant or continue a security \nclearance for Applicant and recommended referral to an administrative judge to \ndetermine whether a clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked. \nSpecifically, the SOR set forth security concerns arising under Guidelines F, D, E, and \n1 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nM.

On June 8, 2022, \nthe case was assigned to me. On June 17, 2022, the Defense Office of Hearings and \nAppeals (DOHA) issued a Notice setting the hearing for August 24, 2022. (Id.) Applicant\u2019s \nhearing was held as scheduled in the vicinity of Arlington, Virginia using the Microsoft \nTeams video teleconference system.

On September 26, 2022, the record closed. \n(Tr. 26-27, 120, 126) \nSome details were excluded to protect Applicant\u2019s right to privacy. Specific \ninformation is available in the cited exhibits and transcript.  \nFindings of Fact \nIn Applicant\u2019s SOR response, he admitted the SOR allegations in \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.e to \n1.k, and 3.a. (HE 3) He did not admit or deny some SOR allegations, and he denied some \nallegations. His admissions are accepted as findings of fact. \nApplicant is a 50-year-old operations manager who has worked for the same DOD \ncontractor since 2013. (Tr. 6, 37-38) In 1990, he graduated from high school. (Tr. 7, 28) \nIn about 2002, he earned an associate\u2019s degree in aviation maintenance technology, and \nin 2003, he was awarded a bachelor\u2019s degree in aviation aerospace management.

(Tr. 39-41) He had a reduction in annual pay from about $98,000 to \nabout $70,000 while he was on active duty. (Tr. 60-62)  \nApplicant was married the first time from 1992 to 1997, and the second time from \n2003 to 2012. (Tr. 8) His stepson is 22, and his son is 18. (Tr. 8-9, 32-33) He served on \nactive duty in the Navy from 1992 to 1997, and in the Navy Reserve from 2014 to present. \n(Tr. 9) He is a petty officer second class (E-5). (Tr. 9) His current Navy specialty is \nYeoman. (Tr. 9) He has 13 years of Navy service. (Tr. 110) \nFinancial Considerations \nSOR \u00b6 1.a alleges Applicant filed for discharge of liabilities totaling $149,105 in \nJanuary 2014 under Chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code, and the bankruptcy judge \ndischarged his nonpriority unsecured debts in April 2015. (GE 1 at 35; GE 2 at 9; GE 6 at \n1) The secured claims totaled $110,935; the priority claims were $850; and the unsecured \nnonpriority claims were $37,320.

(Tr. 44) In 2013, his \nstarting pay was about $24 an hour. (Tr. 42) When he filed for bankruptcy, Applicant was \n$24,000 behind on his $107,604 mortgage, and the fair market value of the property was \nsubstantially below the amount of the mortgage. (Tr. 112; GE 2 at 16) The bankruptcy \ndocumentation indicates Applicant\u2019s monthly income over the previous six months \naveraged $5,647, and his IRS tax transcript showed his income for Tax Year (TY) 2014 \nwas about $109,000. (Tr. 113) Applicant suggested that perhaps the extra funds on his \nTY 2014 tax return came from his military duties, overtime with his contractor employer, \nor a cash payout from a previous employer. (Compare Tr. 116 with GE 2 at 49-51) He \nunderstood that his income could not exceed the threshold in the bankruptcy statute, or \nhe would not qualify for a Chapter 7 bankruptcy discharge of his debts. (Tr. 114-115) He \nsaid he would provide documentation after his hearing to show his income statement on \nhis bankruptcy was correct. (Tr. 117, 121) He did not provide the evidence showing the \nincome on his bankruptcy submission was accurate. His bankruptcy documentation \nincluded a $2,576 state tax lien. (Tr. 48) \nSOR \u00b6 1.b alleges Applicant owes delinquent federal taxes totaling $6,112 for TY \n2014. (GE 3 at 2, 9) His September 24, 2020 IRS tax transcript for TY 2014 shows an \naccount balance of $9,177 owed to the IRS, and it shows IRS tax transfers to address his \nTY 2014 tax debt from TY 2017 of $1,143, from TY 2018 of $1,037, and from TY 2019 of \n$647. (GE 4 at 9-10) He also made a $143 payment on March 10, 2020. (Id.) On February \n14, 2020, Applicant told an Office of Personnel Management (OPM) investigator that he \n\u201carranged a payment plan with the IRS, and made on-time payments until [he] defaulted.\u201d \n(GE 10 at 2) He did not resume payments. (Id.) He told the OPM investigator that he \nintended to borrow funds from his 401k account to pay his delinquent tax debt. (GE 10 at \n4) His tax transcripts for TY 2014 did not show a repayment plan with the IRS. (GE 4 at \n10; AE B) His October 1, 2021 IRS tax transcript for TY 2014 shows an account balance \nof $6,112. (AE B) Applicant\u2019s October 1, 2021 IRS tax transcript for TY 2020 shows on \nApril 15, 2021, he had a $1,332 credit transferred to address his TY 2014 tax debt, and \nhe received a $360 refund. (GE 3 at 18) The $360 refund shows all of his federal income \ntaxes are paid through TY 2020.  \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c and 1.d allege Applicant failed to timely file his federal and state \nincome tax returns for TYs 2010, 2012, 2013, 2015, 2016, 2017, and 2018. (GE 3) \nOn September 30, 2021, in response to DOHA interrogatories, Applicant did not \nfill in the rows in the tables showing his federal and state tax returns were filed for TYs \n2010, 2012, and 2013. (GE 3 at 2, 4) His September 24, 2020 TY 2015 IRS tax transcript \nindicates in 2018 the IRS assessed an additional tax of $1,900; he had a $274 penalty \nfor filing his tax return late; and no payments were shown to address his tax debt. (GE 4 \nat 5-6) His account balance owed on September 24, 2020, was $5,593. (GE 4 at 5) He \nsaid he paid this tax debt. (GE 3 at 2) The IRS $360 refund of his TY 2020 taxes shows \nthe IRS concluded all of his previous federal income taxes were paid. (GE 3 at 18) \nThe information in the following table is based on Applicant\u2019s September 24, 2020 \nand October 1, 2021 IRS tax transcripts.

Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \nIndustry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nabout potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Clearance \ndecisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a \ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 7. \nThus, nothing in this decision should be construed to suggest that it is based, in whole or \nin part, on any express or implied determination about applicant\u2019s allegiance, loyalty, or \npatriotism. It is merely an indication the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the \nPresident, Secretary of Defense, and Director of National Intelligence have established \nfor issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 at 2 \n(App. Bd. May 2, 1996). \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts.

Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds.   \nThe Appeal Board explained the scope and rationale for the financial \nconsiderations security concern in ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012) \n(citation omitted) as follows: \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an applicant might \nknowingly compromise classified information in order to raise money in \nsatisfaction of his or her debts. Rather, it requires a Judge to examine the \ntotality of an applicant\u2019s financial history and circumstances. The Judge \nmust consider pertinent evidence regarding the applicant\u2019s self-control, \njudgment, and other qualities essential to protecting the national secrets as \nwell as the vulnerabilities inherent in the circumstances. The Directive \npresumes a nexus between proven conduct under any of the Guidelines \nand an applicant\u2019s security eligibility. \nAG \u00b6 19 includes disqualifying conditions that could raise a security concern and \nmay be disqualifying in this case: \u201c(a) inability to satisfy debts\u201d; \u201c(c) a history of not meeting \nfinancial obligations\u201d; and \u201c(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or \nlocal income tax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired.\u201d The record establishes the disqualifying conditions in AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a), 19(c), and \n19(f) requiring additional inquiry about the possible applicability of mitigating conditions. \nDiscussion of the disqualifying conditions is contained in the mitigation section, infra.  \nThe financial considerations mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are as follows: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \n9 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly unde.r the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit\ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being\nresolved or is under control;  \n \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts;   \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue; \n(f) the affluence resulted from a legal source of income; and \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority \nto file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \nIn ISCR Case No. 10-04641 at 4 (App. Bd. Sept. 24, 2013), the DOHA Appeal \nBoard explained Applicant\u2019s responsibility for proving the applicability of mitigating \nconditions as follows: \nOnce a concern arises regarding an Applicant\u2019s security clearance \neligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance of \na security clearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th \nCir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991). After the Government \npresents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the \napplicant to rebut or mitigate those concerns. See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. The \nstandard applicable in security clearance decisions is that articulated in \nEgan, supra. \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access \nto classified information will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nDirective, Enclosure 2 \u00b6 2(b). \nApplicant provided some important mitigating information. His family\u2019s income was \nsignificantly reduced when he was divorced. He served on active duty in the Navy from \nNovember 2019 to June 2022, and his Navy pay was less than the pay from the DOD \ncontractor. These circumstances were beyond his control, and they adversely affected \nhis finances. However, \u201c[e]ven if applicant\u2019s financial difficulties initially arose, in whole or \nin part, due to circumstances outside his [or her] control, the judge could still consider \nwhether applicant has since acted in a reasonable manner when dealing with those \nfinancial difficulties.\u201d ISCR Case No. 05-11366 at 4 n.9 (App. Bd.

The loss of his spouse\u2019s \nincome when they were divorced, and his resulting delinquent mortgage were good \nreasons for filing for bankruptcy, and he is credited with paying his delinquent tax debt for \nTY 2014 on April 15, 2021, before the SOR was issued. \nApplicant failed to prove that he timely filed his federal and state income tax returns \nfor TYs 2015, 2016, 2017, and 2018. He said he failed to timely file several tax returns \nbecause of \u201cneglect\u201d and a lack of a \u201csense of urgency.\u201d (Tr. 51) He suspected that he \nowed the IRS, and he delayed filing his tax returns. \nA willful failure to timely make (means complete and file with the IRS) a federal \nincome tax return is a misdemeanor-level federal criminal offense. Title 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7203, \nwillful failure to file return or supply information, reads: \nAny person . . . required by this title or by regulations made under authority \nthereof to make a return, keep any records, or supply any information, who \nwillfully fails to . . .  make such return, keep such records, or supply such \ninformation, at the time or times required by law or regulations, shall, in \naddition to other penalties provided by law, be guilty of a misdemeanor . . . . \nA willful failure to make return, keep records, or supply information when required, \nis a misdemeanor without regard to the existence of any tax liability. Spies v. United \nStates, 317 U.S. 492 (1943); United States v. Walker, 479 F.2d 407 (9th  Cir. 1973); United \nStates v. McCabe, 416 F.2d 957 (7th  Cir. 1969); O\u2019Brien v. United States, 51 F.2d 193 (7th  \nCir. 1931). For purposes of this decision, I am not weighing Applicant\u2019s failure to timely \nfile his federal income tax returns against him as a crime. In regard to the failure to timely \nfile federal income tax returns when due, the DOHA Appeal Board has commented: \nFailure to file tax returns suggests that an applicant has a problem with \ncomplying with well-established governmental rules and systems. Voluntary \ncompliance with such rules and systems is essential for protecting classified \ninformation. ISCR Case No. 01-05340 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 20, 2002). As we \nhave noted in the past, a clearance adjudication is not directed at collecting \ndebts. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 07-08049 at 5 (App. Bd. Jul. 22, 2008). By \nthe same token, neither is it directed toward inducing an applicant to file tax \nreturns. Rather, it is a proceeding aimed at evaluating an applicant\u2019s \njudgment and reliability. Id. A person who fails repeatedly to fulfill his or her \nlegal obligations does not demonstrate the high degree of good judgment \nand reliability required of those granted access to classified information. \nSee, e.g., ISCR Case No. 14-01894 at 5 (App. Bd.

The Appeal Board \nclarified that even in instances where an \u201c[a]pplicant has purportedly corrected [his or her] \nfederal tax problem, and the fact that [applicant] is now motivated to prevent such \nproblems in the future, does not preclude careful consideration of [a]pplicant\u2019s security \nworthiness in light of [his or her] longstanding prior behavior evidencing irresponsibility\u201d \nincluding a failure to timely file federal income tax returns. See ISCR Case No. 15-01031 \nat 3 & n.3 (App. Bd. June 15, 2016) (characterizing \u201cno harm, no foul\u201d approach to an \napplicant\u2019s course of conduct and employing an \u201call\u2019s well that ends well\u201d analysis as \ninadequate to support approval of access to classified information with focus on timing of \nfiling of tax returns after receipt of the SOR). \nApplying the Appeal Board\u2019s jurisprudence, SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c and 1.d are not mitigated \nbecause he did not timely file his TYs 2015, 2016, 2017, and 2018 federal and state \nincome tax returns. As of the date of his hearing on August 24, 2022, he had not filed his \nfederal and state tax returns for TY 2021; he had not requested an extension; and he said \nhe needed additional documentation to get his tax return filed. On September 17, 2022, \nApplicant paid a bill of $275 for preparation of one or more tax returns. His delinquent \nfederal income taxes for TY 2011 were not paid until 2018. His delinquent federal income \ntaxes for TY 2014 were not paid until April 15, 2021. I am not considering his failure to \ntimely file his FY 2020 federal and state income tax returns, and his failure to timely pay \nhis FY 2011 federal income taxes for disqualification purposes. See Discussion of limits \non consideration of non-SOR allegations in the sexual behavior section. \nApplicant has six D. ED. student loan debts totaling $35,398 in collections, and he \nhas not made any payments since about 2017. Complete reliance on the COVID-19 \npandemic-based student loans deferment to establish mitigation for security clearance \npurposes is misplaced. Applicant\u2019s student loans were delinquent before March 2020. \nSee ISCR Case No. 20-03208 at 2 (App. Bd. July 6, 2021); ISCR Case No. 20-01527 at \n2 (App. Bd.

He failed to \nestablish mitigation of financial considerations security concerns. \nSexual Behavior \nAG \u00b6 12 contains the security concern for sexual behavior: \nSexual behavior that involves a criminal offense; reflects a lack of judgment \nor discretion; or may subject the individual to undue influence of coercion, \nexploitation, or duress. These issues, together or individually, may raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s judgment, reliability, trustworthiness, and \nability to protect classified or sensitive information. Sexual behavior \nincludes conduct occurring in person or via audio, visual, electronic, or \nwritten transmission. No adverse inference concerning the standards in this \nGuideline may be raised solely on the basis of the sexual orientation of the \nindividual. \nAG \u00b6 13 includes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying: \n(a) sexual behavior of a criminal nature, whether or not the individual has \nbeen prosecuted; \n(b) a pattern of compulsive, self-destructive, or high-risk sexual behavior \nthat the individual is unable to stop;  \n(c) sexual behavior that causes an individual to be vulnerable to coercion, \nexploitation, or duress;  and \n(d) sexual behavior of a public nature or that reflects lack of discretion or \njudgment. \nApplicant videotaped the buttocks areas of several women in stores and at a \nschool without their consent. He made these videos for his personal sexual arousal. \nMaking these nonconsensual videos of women in public places shows lack of judgment \nand discretion. AG \u00b6 13(d) applies. There was no evidence presented that Applicant\u2019s \nconduct was criminal or that he was unable to stop. When his girlfriend threatened to \nexpose his conduct, he refused to pay her rent. AG \u00b6\u00b6 13(a), 13(b), and 13(c) do not \napply. \n13 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \nAG \u00b6 14 lists conditions that could mitigate security concerns: \n(a) the behavior occurred prior to or during adolescence and there is no \nevidence of subsequent conduct of a similar nature; \n(b) the sexual behavior happened so long ago, so infrequently, or under \nsuch unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or judgment; \n(c) the behavior no longer serves as a basis for coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; \n(d) the sexual behavior is strictly private, consensual, and discreet; and \n(e) the individual has successfully completed an appropriate program of \ntreatment, or is currently enrolled in one, has demonstrated ongoing and \nconsistent compliance with the treatment plan, and/or has received a \nfavorable prognosis from a qualified mental health professional indicating \nthe behavior is readily controllable with treatment. \n \nApplicant claimed at his hearing that all videotapings of women\u2019s buttocks and \ngenitals except in a store were consensual. I find that he minimized the number of women \nsubjected to nonconsensual videotapings. Applicant claimed he did not use his EIP to \nvideotape the women; however, he told his employer that he used his EIP to videotape \nthe women because his phone was broken. I find that he lied at his hearing when he \ndenied that he used his EIP to videotape the buttocks of women without their consent. In \nISCR Case No. 03-20327 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, 2006), the Appeal Board listed five \ncircumstances in which conduct not alleged in an SOR may be considered stating: \n(a) to assess an applicant\u2019s credibility; (b) to evaluate an applicant\u2019s \nevidence of extenuation, mitigation, or changed circumstances; (c) to \nconsider whether an applicant has demonstrated successful rehabilitation; \n(d) to decide whether a particular provision of the Adjudicative Guidelines is \napplicable; or (e) to provide evidence for whole person analysis under \nDirective Section 6.3.  \nId.

I limited my consideration of these \nissues to the five purposes listed above.  \nAG \u00b6 14(c) provides some mitigation because Applicant refused to allow extortion \nfrom his girlfriend to coerce him into paying her rent. His employer and security officials \nare aware of the sexual behavior. AG \u00b6 14(d) does not apply. Applicant\u2019s nonconsensual \nvideotaping behavior was generally private and discrete because he did not want the \nwomen he was videotaping in stores and at a school to discover what he was doing. \n14 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nHowever, Applicant did not meet his burden of proving the videotaping was consensual. \nAppellant did not establish that the women freely chose to be in his videos. \nAG \u00b6 14(e) does not apply. He did not receive therapy to address his \nnonconsensual videotaping of the buttocks of females in stores and a school. \nApplicant did not take full responsibility for his conduct, which is often considered \nthe first step on the road to rehabilitation. More time must pass without actions of security \nconcern before reinstatement of his security clearance will be warranted. Guideline D \nsecurity concerns are not mitigated. \nUse of Information Technology \nAG \u00b6 39 contains the security concern for use of information technology: \nFailure to comply with rules, procedures, guidelines, or regulations \npertaining to information technology systems may raise security concerns \nabout an individual's reliability and trustworthiness, calling into question the \nwillingness or ability to properly protect sensitive systems, networks, and \ninformation. Information Technology includes any computer-based, mobile, \nor wireless device used to create, store, access, process, manipulate, \nprotect, or move information. This includes any component, whether \nintegrated into a larger system or not, such as hardware, software, or \nfirmware, used to enable or facilitate these operations. \nAG \u00b6 40 lists conditions that could raise a use of information technology security \nconcern and may be disqualifying including: \n(a) unauthorized entry into any information technology system; \n(b) unauthorized modification, destruction, or manipulation of, or denial of \naccess to, an information technology system or any data in such a system; \n(c) use of any information technology system to gain unauthorized access \nto another system or to a compartmented area within the same system; \n(d) downloading, storing, or transmitting classified, sensitive, proprietary, or \nother protected information on or to any unauthorized information \ntechnology system; \n(e) unauthorized use of any information technology system; \n(f) introduction, removal, or duplication of hardware, firmware, software, or \nmedia to or from any information technology system when prohibited by \nrules, procedures, guidelines, or regulations or when otherwise not \nauthorized; \n15 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(g) negligence or lax security practices in handling information technology \nthat persists despite counseling by management; and \n(h) any misuse of information technology, whether deliberate or negligent, \nthat results in damage to the national security. \nApplicant placed videotapes of the buttocks and genital areas of women on his \nEIP. He used his EIP to make some of these videotapes. AG \u00b6 40(e) is established. \nAG \u00b6 41 lists use of information technology conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns including: \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the behavior happened, or it happened \nunder such unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur and does not \ncast doubt on the individual's reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the misuse was minor and done solely in the interest of organizational \nefficiency and effectiveness; \n(c) the conduct was unintentional or inadvertent and was followed by a \nprompt, good faith effort to correct the situation and by notification to \nappropriate personnel; and \n(d) the misuse was due to improper or inadequate training or unclear \ninstructions. \nNone of the mitigating conditions fully apply. Applicant was not truthful at his \nhearing about his culpability. He falsely said at his hearing he did not use his EIP to make \nat least some of the nonconsensual videos of women\u2019s buttocks. He told his employer \nthat he used the EIP to make some of the videotapes because his cell phone was broken. \nHis false statements at his hearing show a lack of credibility and rehabilitation. Use of \ninformation technology security concerns are not mitigated. \nPersonal Conduct \nAG \u00b6 15 explains why personal conduct is a security concern stating: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. . . . \n16 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \nAG \u00b6 16 includes two conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying include: \n(d) credible adverse information that is not explicitly covered under any \nother guideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an adverse \ndetermination, but which, when combined with all available information, \nsupports a whole-person assessment of \nquestionable judgment, \nuntrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with \nrules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that the individual \nmay not properly safeguard classified or sensitive information. This \nincludes, but is not limited to, consideration of:  \n(1) untrustworthy or unreliable behavior to include breach of client \nconfidentiality, release of proprietary information, unauthorized release of \nsensitive corporate or government protected information; \n(2) any disruptive, violent, or other inappropriate behavior; \n(3) a pattern of dishonesty or rule violations; and \n(4) evidence of significant misuse of Government or other employer's \ntime or resources; and \n(e) personal conduct, or concealment of information about one's conduct, \nthat creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress by a \nforeign intelligence entity or other individual or group. Such conduct \nincludes: (1) engaging in activities which, if known, could affect the person's \npersonal, professional, or community standing. \nApplicant failed to take steps to secure his password for his EIP, and he recorded \ninappropriate videos of women\u2019s buttocks on his EIP. The evidence establishes \nApplicant\u2019s girlfriend took his EIP without his consent. Applicant failed to report to his FSO \nthat his EIP had been taken by his former girlfriend. She attempted to extort him for rent. \nThe first time Applicant\u2019s employer learned about the misuse of his EIP was when \nApplicant\u2019s former girlfriend reported him for placing inappropriate videos on his EIP. \nSOR \u00b6 3.c alleges under the personal conduct guideline that Applicant used his \nEIP to view pornography from about January 2017 to about November 2017. This \nallegation is not established. The record does not establish that the videotapes of \nwomen\u2019s buttocks wearing clothing are pornographic. The employer report does not \nindicate any images of nude people were found on his EIP. \nSOR \u00b6 3.d cross alleges under the personal conduct guideline the allegation in \nSOR \u00b6 2.a. SOR \u00b6 2.a alleges under the sexual behavior guideline, and the record \nestablishes, that Applicant videotaped women\u2019s buttocks without their knowledge or \nconsent prior to October 2017 for his own sexual gratification. SOR \u00b6 3.d is established; \nhowever, this allegation is a duplication of SOR \u00b6 2.a. \n17 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \nAG \u00b6 17 provides seven conditions that could mitigate security concerns in this \ncase: \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; \n(b) the refusal or failure to cooperate, omission, or concealment was caused \nor significantly contributed to by advice of legal counsel or of a person with \nprofessional responsibilities for advising or instructing the individual \nspecifically concerning security processes. Upon being made aware of the \nrequirement to cooperate or provide the information, the individual \ncooperated fully and truthfully; \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is\nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is\nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability,\ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, \nunreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to \nrecur; \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate vulnerability \nto exploitation, manipulation, or duress; \n(f) the information was unsubstantiated or from a source of questionable \nreliability; and  \n(g) association with persons involved in criminal activities was unwitting, \nhas ceased, or occurs under circumstances that do not cast doubt upon the \nindividual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, judgment, or willingness to comply \nwith rules and regulations. \nApplicant failed to report to security officials the following issues: his own misuse \nof his EIP to make nonconsensual videotapes of women\u2019s buttocks in stores and at a \nschool; his girlfriend\u2019s use of his EIP; and her extortion attempt.

My comments under Guidelines F, D, E, \nand M are incorporated in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) \nwere addressed under those guidelines but some warrant additional comment. \nApplicant is a 50-year-old operations manager who has worked for the same \ndefense contractor since 2013. In about 2002, he earned an associate\u2019s degree in \naviation maintenance technology, and in 2003, he earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in aviation \naerospace management. He has an airframe and power plant license for aviation. He was \non active duty from November 2019 to June 2022, and in June 2022, he resumed working \nfor his current employer. He had a reduction in annual pay from about $98,000 to about \n$70,000 while he was on active duty. He served on active duty in the Navy from 1992 to \n1997, and in the Navy Reserve from 2014 to present. He is a petty officer second class. \nHe has 13 years of Navy service. \nApplicant provided important financial considerations mitigating information. His \ndelinquent debts were affected by circumstances beyond his control. He was divorced \nand he lost the financial support he received from his spouse which was necessary to pay \nhis mortgage. His pay was reduced while he was on active duty in the Navy. He filed \nbankruptcy. In 2015, his nonpriority unsecured debts were discharged. \nThe evidence against grant of a security clearance is more substantial at this time. \nApplicant did not establish that he was unable to make greater progress sooner filing his \nfederal and state income tax returns for TYs 2015, 2016, 2017, and 2018. As of the date \nof his hearing on August 24, 2022, he had not filed his federal and state tax returns for \nTY 2021. His federal and state tax returns for TY 2021 were prepared in September 2022. \nHis federal income taxes for TY 2011 were not paid until 2018. His delinquent federal \nincome taxes for TY 2014 were not paid until April 15, 2021. He has six D. ED. student \nloan debts totaling $35,398 in collections, and he has not made any payments on these \nsix D. ED. loans since about 2017. He has not recently made any payments to address a \ncharged-off debt for $22,619. His failure to take prudent, responsible actions raise \nunmitigated questions about his reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified \ninformation. See AG \u00b6 18. \nIn 2017, Applicant used his EIP to non-consensually videotape the buttocks of \nwomen in stores and a school. His girlfriend disclosed the abuse of his EIP to Applicant\u2019s \nemployer. He minimized the number of women he videotaped, and he falsely claimed all \n19 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_________________________ \nexcept one of the videotapings were consensual. He falsely claimed he did not use his \nEIP to make any videos. A failure to be forthright and candid about security-relevant \nconduct at a security clearance hearing shows a lack of rehabilitation. \nIt is well settled that once a concern arises regarding an applicant\u2019s security \nclearance eligibility, there is a strong presumption against granting a security clearance. \nSee Dorfmont, 913 F. 2d at 1401. \u201c[A] favorable clearance decision means that the record \ndiscloses no basis for doubt about an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified \ninformation.\u201d ISCR Case No. 18-02085 at 7 (App. Bd. Jan. 3, 2020) (citing ISCR Case \nNo.12-00270 at 3 (App. Bd. Jan. 17, 2014)). \nI have carefully applied the law, as set forth in Egan, Exec. Or. 10865, the Directive, \nthe AGs, and the Appeal Board\u2019s jurisprudence to the facts and circumstances in the \ncontext of the whole person. Applicant failed to mitigate financial considerations, sexual \nbehavior, personal conduct, and use of information technology security concerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:   \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a and 1.b:  \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.c through 1.k:  \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline D: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 2.a: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 3, Guideline E:   \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 3.a and 3.b: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 3.c and 3.d: \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 4, Guideline M:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 4.a: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the interests of national security of \nthe United States to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s national security eligibility for access to \nclassified information.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact The SOR alleges under Guideline H that Applicant purchased and used khat (cathinone) from about January 2013 through at least May 2018 (SOR \u00b6 1.a) and that he purchased and used marijuana from January 2013 through at least July 2018 (SOR \u00b6 1.b). Under Guideline E, the SOR alleges that Applicant was found guilty of a January 2017 assault and incarcerated for a time (SOR \u00b6 2.a); that he was terminated from jobs in 2017 (SOR \u00b6 2.b) and February 2018 (SOR \u00b6 2.d); and that he resigned from a job in July 2017 after he had been told he would be fired (SOR \u00b6 2.c). Applicant admitted the allegations when he answered the SOR. His admissions are accepted and incorporated as factual findings. After considering the pleadings, exhibits, and transcript, I make the following additional findings of fact. Applicant is a 43-year-old naturalized U.S. citizen. He left his native country in October 1999 to attend a high school in France. After he graduated from high school, he came to the United States as a tourist in late August 2001, but left for Canada in April 2002 to seek asylum, citing his fear of being arrested and tortured for protesting against the government in his native country. His application for asylum was denied by Canada. In November 2005, he returned to the United States and applied for asylum here. (GEs 1, 5.) No information was presented in evidence about Applicant\u2019s activities in the United States over the next four years. The United States granted him asylum ",

The DCSA CAF explained in the SOR why it \nwas unable to find it clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue \nsecurity clearance eligibility for him. The DCSA CAF took the action under Executive Order \n(EO) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as \namended; Department of Defense (DOD) Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel \nSecurity Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the \nNational Security Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) effective June 8, 2017, applicable to all \nadjudications for national security eligibility or eligibility to hold a sensitive position. \n1 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nOn January 16, 2020, Applicant answered the SOR allegations and requested a \nhearing before a Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) administrative judge.

On \nFebruary 24, 2022, the case was assigned to me to determine whether it is clearly \nconsistent with the interests of national security to grant or continue a security clearance \nfor Applicant.

At the Government\u2019s request, \nand with no objection from Applicant, on April 8, 2022, I rescheduled Applicant\u2019s hearing \nfor April 28, 2022. \nAt the hearing, five Government exhibits (GE 1-5) were admitted into evidence \nwithout any objections. Documents submitted by Applicant when he responded to the SOR \nwere accepted into evidence without any objection as an Applicant exhibit (AE A). \nApplicant testified, as reflected in a hearing transcript (Tr.) received electronically on May \n5, 2022. \nFindings of Fact \nThe SOR alleges under Guideline H that Applicant purchased and used khat \n(cathinone) from about January 2013 through at least May 2018 (SOR \u00b6 1.a) and that he \npurchased and used marijuana from January 2013 through at least July 2018 (SOR \u00b6 1.b). \nUnder Guideline E, the SOR alleges that Applicant was found guilty of a January 2017 \nassault and incarcerated for a time (SOR \u00b6 2.a); that he was terminated from jobs in 2017 \n(SOR \u00b6 2.b) and February 2018 (SOR \u00b6 2.d); and that he resigned from a job in July 2017 \nafter he had been told he would be fired (SOR \u00b6 2.c).

He remained eligible for assignments until February 2017, \nalthough he had no interpreter work after June 2015. (GE 2.) He attended a technical \ninstitute for one semester in the fall of 2009. He earned an associate\u2019s degree in June \n2012 and a bachelor\u2019s degree in January 2015. (GE 1.) \nShortly after he relocated, Applicant began volunteering his time, language skills, \nand knowledge of immigration and social services to immigrants from his native country \nthrough their community organization. He helped many new immigrants in their transitions \nto life in the United States, and spoke positively of the values of the United States. As of \nApril 2017, he was spending about 25 hours a week in community service while studying to \ntake the examination for law school toward possibly becoming an immigration attorney. (AE \nA.) \nCriminal Charges \nAround July 2016, Applicant began dating an asylum seeker from his native country. \nOn January 10, 2017, he and this now ex-girlfriend had an argument. He asserts that she \nbecame emotional after the 2016 presidential election, as she feared her asylum \napplication would be disapproved by the then-U.S. administration because of its stance on \nimmigration, and so she attempted to convince him to marry her, thinking it would aid her \ncase for U.S. refugee status. (GEs 2-3, 5; Tr. 25-26.) Over the course of the day, Applicant \nconsumed six to eight 12-ounce beers. He maintains that after telling her that he wanted to \nend their relationship, she struck him in the chest, and he pushed her backwards. He left \nthe apartment to purchase more alcohol, and she called the police. (GE 2.) \nApplicant\u2019s ex-girlfriend was no longer at the apartment when the police arrived, as \nshe had gone to the police station. Applicant was outside the apartment when the police \narrived. He told the police that he had argued with his ex-girlfriend, but that it \u201cwas no big \ndeal,\u201d and explained that he had gone out to purchase more beer. He consented to a \nsearch of the apartment, and the police seized a large kitchen knife from a drying rack. (GE \n3.) \nAt the police station, Applicant\u2019s ex-girlfriend, a French speaker with limited facility in \nEnglish, complained that \u201cher cousin\u201d (Applicant) had pushed her to the couch, put a \nkitchen knife to her throat, and told her he would kill her. When she screamed, he put down \nthe knife but returned with a cigarette and told her he would hurt her face. She further \ncomplained that he put his hands to her breasts at the door, but then returned to the room, \nwhere he threatened to rape her and exposed himself before putting the knife back and \nleaving the premises. She was adamant that there was no sexual relationship between her \nand Applicant, and claimed that she was staying in his apartment temporarily because \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nthere was a problem with her apartment. At the station, Applicant admitted to the police \nthat he had argued with his ex-girlfriend and had thrown some things around the \napartment, but he denied that he threatened her. He told the police that he had consumed \nas many as eight to ten beers earlier in the day. (GE 3.) \nThe police reported seeing no signs that Applicant\u2019s ex-girlfriend was injured. (GE \n3.) Yet Applicant was arrested and charged with aggravated assault, criminal threatening \nwith a dangerous weapon, assault, and indecent conduct on his ex-girlfriend (SOR \u00b6 2.a). \nHe could not post bail and was jailed from January 11, 2017, until February 22, 2017, when \na reduced bail was posted. (GE 4.) \nOne of Applicant\u2019s neighbors and the neighbor\u2019s mother were interviewed by a \nprivate investigator in June 2017 at the request of Applicant\u2019s defense attorney. The \nneighbor expressed her belief that Applicant and the ex-girlfriend had a personal \nrelationship as she had observed public displays of affection between them, and she had \nnot seen or heard any signs of acrimony between them. The neighbor\u2019s mother believed \nApplicant and the ex-girlfriend were married, and she described Applicant as a good man. \n(AE A.) \nIn July 2017, Applicant pled guilty to the criminal threatening and assault charges, \nand prosecution was deferred with conditions. Applicant was required to refrain from any \ncriminal conduct, any contact with his ex-girlfriend, and any possession of a dangerous \nweapon; abstain from the use of alcohol and illegal drugs with random testing; and undergo \nsubstance abuse and psychological evaluations with updates to be provided every three \nmonths. (GE 4.) \nApplicant began monthly counseling with a licensed alcohol and drug counselor in \nearly March 2017 to work on substance abuse issues, relationship issues, and \ncommunication skills. As of mid-April 2017, he reported to the counselor that he was \nabstaining from drinking and was not socializing with anyone who might promote an activity \nharmful to his future. (AE A.) As of January 12, 2018, Applicant was regularly attending his \ncounseling appointments with no report of any relapses. (AE A.) He attended counseling \nsessions for about one year. (Tr. 33-34.) \nOn July 6, 2018, the state moved to withdraw Applicant\u2019s guilty plea to the felony \ncriminal threatening charge pursuant to the plea agreement and successful completion of \nthe deferment period. Applicant was found guilty of assault and sentenced to a jail term of \n42 days with credit for time served. He was ordered to pay fines and surcharges totaling \n$430 payable at $25 a month. A late fee of $50 was assessed on August 13, 2018. He \nmade a cash payment of $100 on September 13, 2018, to avoid a warrant. (GE 4.) \nOn October 9, 2018, Applicant underwent a counterintelligence-focused security \nscreening (CSS) as part of his application for a linguist position with the company currently \nsponsoring him for security clearance eligibility. About the January 2017 incident involving \nhis ex-girlfriend, Applicant stated that her asylum application was pending at the time, and \nthat she threw dishes at him because he would not marry her.

(GE 5.) \nApplicant listed his January 2017 arrest and his sentence for misdemeanor assault \non an October 11, 2018, security clearance application (SF 86). (GE 1.) During an October \n29, 2018 subject interview (SI) with an authorized investigator for the Office of Personnel \nManagement (OPM), Applicant stated that he began dating an asylum seeker from his \nnative country in July 2016, and that they briefly cohabited until she obtained her own \napartment in the same building. He explained that they argued after he told her he did not \nwant to engage in a fraudulent marriage, and she became increasingly emotional and \npunched him in the chest with a closed fist. After he informed her that he wanted to end \ntheir relationship, she became \u201cextremely outraged,\u201d and struck him again. He retaliated by \npushing her backwards, although he claimed it was not enough for her to fall or cause her \ninjury. Applicant vehemently denied her accusations of attempted rape or of putting a knife \nto her neck. He pled guilty to misdemeanor assault under a plea agreement, but he \nmaintained that his ex-girlfriend had fabricated the entire event, thinking that she would \nreceive more favorable consideration for U.S. \u201ccitizenship.\u201d Applicant denied that he was \nrequired to participate in any program for alcohol use or anger management as a condition \nof his release. (GE 2.) He currently asserts he pled guilty only to put the incident behind \nhim. The criminal proceedings occurred before he applied for a clearance, and he did not \nrealize that a conviction could negatively impact his future. (Tr. 26, 31.) He has not had any \ncontact with his ex-girlfriend since the incident. (Tr. 31.) \nAdverse Employment Issues \n \nBetween 2016 and 2018, Applicant had three jobs that ended under unfavorable \ncircumstances. He was terminated from his job as a production worker at a bakery in \u201c2016 \nor 2017\u201d (SOR \u00b6 2.b). Applicant did not list this job on his SF 86. (GE 1.) When asked \nabout this developed information during his SI, Applicant recalled that he had worked for a \nbakery as a production worker in \u201c2016 or 2017 for six months,\u201d when he was fired on-the-\nspot after his supervisor heard him say that he was going to quit because it was too hot on \nthe job. (GE 2.) At his security clearance hearing, he initially asserted that he quit the \nbakery job because he thought he could spend his time on more important work, such as \npreparing and taking the admission examination for law school, and that the company \n\u201ctricked\u201d him about the nature of the job. He subsequently admitted that he was fired after \nmissing work twice. (Tr. 41-42.) \nIn February 2017, Applicant began working full time as a behavioral-health \nprofessional for children. He provided support for a student with special needs, helping him \nwith behavior and focus issues. (Tr. 43.) During the summer of 2017, Applicant did not take \nonline classes required to meet state-certification requirements, as he believed he should \nnot have to take them on his own time without compensation. He resigned in July 2017 in \nlieu of being terminated (SOR \u00b6 2.c). (GEs 1-3.) On his SF 86, he indicated that he quit the \njob after being told he would be fired, and explained he lost the job over money issues, \nstating: \u201cMy employer and I came to an agreement because I was not able to make enough \nmoney during the summer of 2017 so I quit\u201d (SOR \u00b6 2.c).

He asserts that, to end his employment, the company \nwas required by policy to issue him a letter stating that he was fired or terminated. (Tr. 44-\n45.) \nApplicant next worked as a full-time linguist at a hospital from November 2017 until \nFebruary 2018. He indicated on his SF 86 that he had been fired from the job \u201cfor missing \n3 or 4 days due to [a] personal matter\u201d (SOR \u00b6 2.d). During his SI, Applicant was asked \nabout the nature of the \u201cpersonal matter.\u201d He declined to provide any further information, \neven after he was advised that the failure to provide the requested information could \npreclude a determination of his clearance eligibility. (GE 2.) At his hearing, he explained \nthat he had car issues and was fired by the hospital for being late twice and absent once \nduring his probationary period. (Tr. 47-48.) When asked why he would not tell the OPM \ninvestigator about the \u201cpersonal matter\u201d that led to his job termination, Applicant claimed \nthat he was not asked about it during his SI. (Tr. 48.) \nDrug Involvement \nIn June 2018, Applicant applied to work as a linguist with a federal contractor. He \nwas unemployed at the time. (GE 1.) During his October 9, 2018 CSS, Applicant related \nthat he smoked marijuana once or twice a week from 2009 to July 2018 when he stopped \nusing marijuana because he would be drug tested as a linguist with the defense contractor. \n(GE 5.) When he completed his SF 86 on October 1, 2018, he indicated that he used and \npurchased marijuana for recreational purchases from January 2013 to May 2018 at a \nfrequency of once a month (SOR \u00b6 1.b). He denied any intention to use or purchase the \ndrug in the future, and stated, \u201cI am grown up and this job that I am applying for is serious \nabout drug usage.\u201d (GE 1.) During his October 29, 2018 SI, Applicant related that he used \nmarijuana in his home every weekend between January 2013 and May 2018, and that he \npurchased marijuana from friends at a cost of $40 a week. He explained that he used \nmarijuana initially out of curiosity and continued using marijuana because it relaxed him. \nApplicant would not provide the names of the persons from whom he bought marijuana \nbecause he did not want to get them in trouble. He admitted knowing that it was a violation \nunder federal law to possess marijuana, but given that it was legal in his state, coupled with \nthe fact that \u201ceveryone does it,\u201d he did not feel it was a big deal. Applicant denied any \nintention to resume using marijuana. \nApplicant was then asked during his SI whether he had experimented with or used \nany other illegal substance. He responded \u201cNo\u201d initially, but after being provided examples \nof drugs, Applicant volunteered that he consumed two or three leaves of khat (a shrub with \ntwo active ingredients, cathine and cathinone, used for its stimulant effect, see GE 6), on \nthe weekends once or twice a month from January 2013 to May 2018. He related that he \npurchased the stimulant on the black market in his area. He was aware that it was against \nstate and federal laws to use khat, but explained that it was \u201cheritage related;\u201d that the use \nof khat was common and \u201cnot taboo\u201d (was culturally accepted) in his native land.

He listed \nmarijuana and khat use \u201cFew Times (once a week)\u201d from January 2013 to May 2018. He \ndenied any current association with known drug users or any frequenting of places where \nhe had reason to believe drugs were being used. He commented about his drug use, as \nfollows: \nFor the khat and marijuana, I used them just for pleasure and I was not \naware that the security clearance process would ask me about the use of \nthose drugs. I never had any addictions or issues with them. It never \nimpaired me physically or psychologically. I also want to express that khat is \nnot considered illegal in the East African countries where I grew up. \nMarijuana is also not considered illegal in the state of [name omitted], where \nI live at this moment. Those are the reasons why I did purchase those \nsubstances. But I put everything behind me since the [security clearance] \nprocess started for me. (GE 2.) \nAt his hearing, Applicant was not asked about the discrepancy between his CSS, \nwhere he reported first using marijuana in 2009, and his SF 86, SI, and hearing, where he \nmaintained that he started using marijuana in January 2013. He testified at his hearing that \nhe began using marijuana in college (Tr. 55-56), and that he used marijuana recreationally \nonce a week on the weekends. (Tr. 56.) When asked about the discrepancy in dates for his \nreported last use of marijuana (July 2018 during the CSS, and May 2018 on his SF 86 and \nduring his SI), Applicant responded, \u201cI can\u2019t really be specific. But it was within that range \nof time. Like those two days [sic].\u201d (Tr. 57.) \nApplicant explained that marijuana \u201cwas kind of legal,\u201d and it was easy to obtain in \nhis state. (Tr. 62.) As to why he used marijuana when it could possibly hinder his chance of \na legal career or his ability to aid other immigrants in his community, Applicant responded \nthat \u201cit was something that [he] was not consuming every day;\u201d it was not hurting him; he \ndid it only on the weekends; he did not think about any possible negative impacts his use \ncould have on his future; it was just keeping him relaxed; and \u201c[he] was just doing it for the \nsake of doing it. Or [his] friends [were] doing it.\u201d (Tr. 63.) Applicant denies any use of \nmarijuana since 2018 (Tr. 58), and asserts that he cut ties in 2018 with those friends who \nused marijuana. (Tr. 64.) When asked about his marijuana use in 2018, which would \nappear to have been in violation of the condition of his deferred disposition that he abstain \nfrom illegal drug use, Applicant initially asserted that he was not told that he was not \nsupposed to use illegal drugs. (Tr. 67.) He then claimed that he stopped using illegal drugs \nwhen the court ordered him to refrain from illegal drug use and that he \u201cmaybe made a \nmistake with the dates [of his drug use].\u201d (Tr. 68.) \nApplicant denies any use of khat since 2018. (Tr. 58.) In December 2019, he went to \nhis native country for his marriage to a resident citizen of that country.

(Tr. 60.) \nPolicies \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion the Executive \nBranch has in regulating access to information pertaining to national security, emphasizing \nthat \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 \nU.S. 518, 528 (1988). When evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, \nthe administrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are required to be considered in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. These guidelines \nare not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, \nthese guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative \nprocess. The administrative judge\u2019s overall adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious \nscrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative \njudge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, \nfavorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence \nto establish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant \nis responsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . ..\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information.

Controlled \nsubstance means any \u201ccontrolled substance\u201d as defined in 21 U.S.C. 802. \nSubstance misuse is the generic term adopted in this guideline to describe \nany of the behaviors listed above. \nIn addition to the above matters, I note that effective May 2, 2018, the state in which \nApplicant has resided since June 2015 legalized the use of marijuana in a private \nresidence, and the possession or transport by adults 21 years of age and older, of up to \n2\u00bd ounces of marijuana or 2\u00bd ounces of a combination of marijuana and no more than \nfive grams of marijuana concentrate. The law authorized purchases from a marijuana store \nof up to 2\u00bd ounces of adult-use marijuana. Any violation became punishable by a civil fine \nof up to $100. \nHowever, marijuana remains a Schedule I controlled substance under federal law \npursuant to Title 21, Section 812 of the United States Code. Schedule I drugs are those \nwhich have a high potential for abuse; have no currently accepted medical use in treatment \nin the United States; and lack accepted safety for use of the drug under medical \nsupervision. Section 844 under Title 21 of the United States Code makes it unlawful for any \nperson to knowingly or intentionally possess a controlled substance not obtained pursuant \nto a valid prescription. On October 25, 2014, the then Director of National Intelligence (DNI) \nissued guidance that changes to laws by some states and the District of Columbia to \nlegalize or decriminalize the recreational use of marijuana do not alter existing federal law \nor the National Security Adjudicative Guidelines, and that an individual\u2019s disregard of \nfederal law pertaining to the use, sale, or manufacture of marijuana remains adjudicatively \nrelevant in national security determinations. \nOn December 21, 2021, the current DNI issued clarifying guidance concerning \nmarijuana, noting that prior recreational use of marijuana by an individual may be relevant \nto security adjudications, but is not determinative in the whole-person evaluation. Relevant \nfactors in mitigation include the frequency of use and whether the individual can \ndemonstrate that future use is unlikely to recur. The DNI also made clear that products that \ncontain more than 0.3 percent of THC remain illegal to use under federal law and policy. \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \nThere is a significant unresolved evidentiary discrepancy as to when Applicant first \nused marijuana. Whether he began using marijuana in 2009 or not until January 2013, his \npossession of the drug was illegal under federal law. His use of marijuana prior to May \n2018 was also illegal under state law. As for his possession of khat, khat\u2019s two active \ningredients are two central nervous system stimulants: cathinone, which is a Schedule I \ndrug under the Federal Controlled Substances Act, and cathine, which is a Schedule IV \ndrug. While the United States Drug Enforcement Administration reports that the use of khat \nis an established cultural tradition for many social situations in East Africa and the Arabian \nPeninsula, khat produces a stimulant effect and can induce manic behavior with grandiose \ndelusions, paranoia, nightmares, hallucinations, and hyperactivity. (GE 6.) The regularity of \nApplicant\u2019s marijuana and khat use, every week for at least five years, shows that use of \nthose drugs was a significant part of his lifestyle. He purchased both drugs illegally. The \nevidence establishes disqualifying conditions AG \u00b6\u00b6 25(a), \u201cany substance misuse (see \nabove definition),\u201d and 25 (c), \u201cillegal possession of a controlled substance, including \ncultivation, processing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of drug \nparaphernalia.\u201d \nApplicant bears the burden of establishing that matters in mitigation apply to his \nmarijuana and khat possession and use. AG \u00b6 26 provides for mitigation as follows: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non an individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or drug involvement and substance \nmisuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and \nhas established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not limited to: \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were \nused; and \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all \nillegal drug involvement and substance misuse, acknowledging \nthat any future involvement or misuse is grounds for revocation \nof national security eligibility; \n(c) abuse of prescription drugs was after a severe or prolonged illness during \nwhich these drugs were prescribed, and abuse has since ended; and \n(d) satisfactory completion of a prescribed drug treatment program, including, \nbut not limited to, rehabilitation and aftercare requirements, without \nrecurrence of abuse, and a favorable prognosis by a duly qualified medical \nprofessional. \n10 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nRegarding AG \u00b6 25(a), Applicant\u2019s drug involvement was recent as of his SF 86. \nHowever, there is no evidence that he used marijuana or khat since July 2018. In that \naspect, he benefitted from the delay in processing his case to a hearing. AG \u00b6 25(a) \nprovides for some mitigation because his drug involvement \u201chappened so long ago.\u201d \nApplicant has repeatedly denied any intention to use marijuana or khat in the future. \nYet, there are aggravating circumstances in this case, most notably the regularity of his \ndrug involvement and his inconsistent accounts as to the dates and frequency of his drug \nuse, which preclude me from finding at this time that he has demonstrated a \u201csufficient \npattern of abstinence\u201d under AG \u00b6 25(b). During his October 2018 CSS, he indicated that \nhe used marijuana one to two times a week from 2009 to \u201cthree months ago (7/2018).\u201d \nOnly two days later, he completed his SF 86. He indicated that he used marijuana from \nJanuary 2013 to May 2018 once a month. Applicant now asserts that he may have been \nmistaken about the date of his last marijuana use, but that would not explain the \ndiscrepancy in the reported frequency of his marijuana use (once or twice a week versus \nonce a month). During his October 2018 SI, he indicated that he used marijuana every \nweekend between January 2013 and May 2018, and, after denying any other use of a \ncontrolled substance, he stated that he used khat on the weekends, once or twice a month. \nIn responding to interrogatories in October 2019, he reported that he used marijuana and \nkhat between January 2013 and May 2018 once a week. \nMoreover, when asked at his hearing why he continued to use marijuana in violation \nof the condition of his deferred disposition to abstain from all illegal drug use, he initially \nmaintained that he was not told that he had to abstain. He then denied that he used any \nillegal drugs during the deferred disposition. Court records show that he was ordered to \nabstain from alcohol and illegal drug use starting in July 2017. His present claim that he \ncomplied with the court order, which is tantamount to a denial of any illegal drug use \nbetween July 2017 and July 2018, cannot be reconciled with his self-reported use of \nmarijuana and khat on a weekly basis to May 2018, if not July 2018. It undermines his case \nfor establishing the requirement under AG \u00b6 26(b) that he fully acknowledge his drug \ninvolvement. He has not demonstrated the reform sufficient to mitigate the drug \ninvolvement security concerns. \nGuideline E: Personal Conduct \nThe security concerns about personal conduct are set forth in AG \u00b6 15, which \nprovides: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions about \nan individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified or \nsensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to cooperate or provide \ntruthful and candid answers during national security investigative or \nadjudicative processes. \n11 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant pled guilty to assaulting an ex-girlfriend in January 2017, in return for the \ndismissal of some felony charges stemming from the incident. During his SI, he denied any \nmisconduct, including any assault, claimed that she made false claims to possibly obtain a \nfavorable review of her refugee application. A neighbor provided corroboration for \nApplicant\u2019s account that he had a personal relationship with the alleged victim. It does \nappear that the ex-girlfriend falsely claimed to the police that she and Applicant were \n\u201ccousins,\u201d and that he had never kissed her before. She recounted that Applicant beat her \nto the door and then left the room before coming back and threatening her. If he left the \nroom, it raises questions as to why she did not leave the apartment at that time. There is \nsignificant doubt as to several of her claims. It is noted that the police observed no injuries \non the victim. \nHowever, Applicant acknowledged to the police and during his CSS that he pushed \nhis ex-girlfriend. He had consumed as many as eight to ten beers over the course of the \nday while arguing with his girlfriend. Court records show that he was adjudged guilty of \nmisdemeanor assault as charged and sentenced to 42 days in jail, with credit for time \nserved, and ordered to pay $430. The evidence is sufficient to find that he committed \nassault, although likely not as egregious as his ex-girlfriend claimed. His behavior in that \nregard raises concerns about his judgment. \nThe evidence also establishes the adverse employment information alleged in SOR \n\u00b6\u00b6 2.b through 2.d, which, while not serious on its own, when coupled with the assault, \nimplicates AG \u00b6 16(d): \n(d) credible adverse information that is not explicitly covered under any other \nguideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an adverse determination, but \nwhich, when combined with all available information, supports a whole-\nperson \nassessment \nof \nquestionable \njudgment, \nuntrustworthiness, \nunreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and \nregulations, or other characteristics indicating that the individual may not \nproperly safeguard classified or sensitive information. \nThe following two mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 17 are relevant in this case: \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is so \ninfrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is unlikely \nto recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; and \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling to \nchange the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the stressors, \ncircumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, unreliable, or \nother inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to recur. \nThere is significant evidence in mitigation. The assaultive behavior and employment \nissues occurred more than four years ago.

Issues of \ntime and attendance are personnel matters that do not raise current concerns about his \njudgment absent any recent, similar behavior. The issue of his unwillingness to take \nrequired online classes to keep his job as a behavioral-health professional engenders \nsome concern about whether he would comply with security requirements when it is \ninconvenient or disadvantageous, but it appears to have been isolated. The adverse \nemployment terminations between 2016 and 2017 are not serious enough to warrant \ndenial of his security clearance eligibility on that basis. \nAssault is not considered a minor offense. The lack of any contact by Applicant with \nhis ex-girlfriend since the incident minimizes the risk, but it does not necessarily preclude a \nrecurrence of the poor judgment exhibited by him on that occasion. He admits that he \npushed her but asserts that it was not enough to cause her any injury. His failure to \nacknowledge the inappropriateness of his behavior, including the extent to which his \nalcohol may have influenced his actions, casts doubt on his reform. His assertion that his \nex-girlfriend completely fabricated the incident shows that he has yet to accept any \nmeaningful responsibility for his behavior on that occasion, even after one year of \ncounseling. Applicant is credited with attending all of his required counseling sessions, and \nhis ex-girlfriend may have falsely accused him in some aspects. However, Applicant\u2019s \nexplanation that she lied in order to obtain a more favorable review of her asylum case is \nunsubstantiated. The personal conduct security concerns raised by the assault are not fully \nmitigated. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of his conduct and \nall relevant circumstances in light of the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 \n2(d). They are as follows: \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances \nsurrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the \nfrequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at \nthe time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which participation is voluntary; (6) \nthe presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral \nchanges; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, \ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or \nrecurrence. \nApplicant\u2019s volunteer service to his immigrant community, which was substantial \nfrom 2015 to at least 2017, reflects positively on his character. However, it is well settled \nthat once a concern arises regarding an applicant\u2019s security clearance eligibility, there is a \nstrong presumption against the grant or renewal of a security clearance. See Dorfmont v. \nBrown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th  Cir. 1990). While khat use was common in his native \ncountry and culturally accepted among his immigrant community, Applicant showed poor \n13 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \njudgment in buying the drug on the black market in the United States. He admitted that he \ndid not consider the possible risk of his drug involvement to his future plans to attend law \nschool or to his service to the local community. During his SI, he admitted that he knew it \nwas illegal to possess marijuana under federal law. It is no justification that marijuana use \nwas prevalent or that it was easily procured, or that he did not foresee when he used illegal \ndrugs that he would be applying for a security clearance. Inconsistencies in Applicant\u2019s \ndescriptions of the frequency and duration of his marijuana involvement cause credibility \nconcerns. The failure to provide an honest and candid self-report of drug possession and \nuse is an important indication that, if granted security clearance eligibility, the individual \nwould similarly not disclose any threats to national security, if the disclosure involves an \nissue that might damage his or her own career or personal reputation. For the reasons \npreviously discussed, doubts persist as to whether it is clearly consistent with the national \ninterest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security clearance at this time. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline H:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.b: \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraph 2.a.:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nSubparagraphs 2.b-2.d: \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n____________________ \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances, it is not clearly consistent with the national \ninterest to grant eligibility for a security clearance for Applicant.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Under Guideline F, the Government alleged that Applicant owed $46,578 for four delinquent or past-due debts (SOR 1.a, 1.c, 1.d, and 1.e), one of which (SOR 1.a) was a federal income tax debt for $6,584. It was further alleged that Applicant filed a Chapter 13 bankruptcy petition in April 2017 that was dismissed in April 2018 for failure to make payments as required by the petition\u2019s wage earners plan (SOR 2.b). In response, Applicant admitted all of the SOR allegations and provided information about his 2017 Chapter 13 petition. (Answer) In addition to the facts established by Applicant\u2019s admissions, I make the following findings of fact. 2 Applicant is 45 years old and has worked as a civilian military instructor for two different defense contractors since March 2010. He was hired by his current employer in April 2013. Applicant served on active duty in the military between April 1996 and August 2006, and he has held a security clearance since 2004. (GX 1; Tr. 32 \u2013 35) Applicant was married between 2005 and 2017, when he and his ex-wife divorced after separating in 2014. They have two children, ages 14 and 11 together.

The guideline cited in the SOR was part of the \nadjudicative guidelines (AG) issued by the Director of National Intelligence on December \n10, 2016, to be effective for all adjudications on or after June 8, 2017. \nApplicant timely responded to the SOR (Answer) and requested a hearing before \nan administrative judge from the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA). The \ncase was assigned to me on January 16, 2020, and I scheduled a hearing to be convened \non March 31, 2020. That hearing was subsequently cancelled because of travel and other \nrestrictions imposed by the Secretary of Defense at the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic. \nOn July 19, 2021, I rescheduled this matter for hearing on August 25, 2021; however, \nApplicant requested that I continue the hearing pending his retention of legal counsel.

Applicant\u2019s List of \nExhibits is included as HX 3, and they were admitted without objection. Additionally, I held \nthe record open after the hearing to allow Applicant to submit additional relevant \ninformation. I received a transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on January 20, 2022. The record \nclosed on February 4, 2020, when I received AX M \u2013 CC. The emails forwarding those \nexhibits is included as HX 4, and the exhibits were admitted without objection, as stated \nin an email included as HX 5. \nFindings of Fact \nUnder Guideline F, the Government alleged that Applicant owed $46,578 for four \ndelinquent or past-due debts (SOR 1.a, 1.c, 1.d, and 1.e), one of which (SOR 1.a) was a \nfederal income tax debt for $6,584. It was further alleged that Applicant filed a Chapter \n13 bankruptcy petition in April 2017 that was dismissed in April 2018 for failure to make \npayments as required by the petition\u2019s wage earners plan (SOR 2.b). In response, \nApplicant admitted all of the SOR allegations and provided information about his 2017 \nChapter 13 petition.

He was hired by his current employer in \nApril 2013. Applicant served on active duty in the military between April 1996 and August \n2006, and he has held a security clearance since 2004. (GX 1; Tr. 32 \u2013 35) \nApplicant was married between 2005 and 2017, when he and his ex-wife divorced \nafter separating in 2014. They have two children, ages 14 and 11 together. Terms of \nApplicant\u2019s divorce required him to pay child support of $1,200 each month, alimony of \n$800 each month, and to provide ongoing medical insurance for his ex-wife and his \nchildren. Applicant also was required to pay most of the couple\u2019s debts, including \nmortgage and car loans. (GX 1; GX 2; AX K; Tr. 37 \u2013 38) \nThe SOR allegations of debt and bankruptcy are supported by GX 1 \u2013 5, by \nApplicant\u2019s discussion of those issues in a personal subject interview conducted on \nFebruary 10, February 13, and March 6, 2017, and by Applicant\u2019s admissions to those \nallegations. The tax debt alleged at SOR 1.a arose when Applicant claimed his wife and \nchildren as dependents on his 2014 federal income tax return. Unbeknownst to him, his \nwife filed her own 2014 return and claimed their children as exemptions. This precluded\nApplicant from getting those deductions, resulting in an unexpected federal income tax\nbill for $11,693, which he was unable to pay outright. He contacted the IRS in 2015 to \nestablish a repayment plan; however, available information shows that he did not make\nany direct payments on his 2014 tax bill until September 2021. At that time, Applicant paid \n$8,162.55 to the IRS to resolve that debt. The rest of the original obligation likely was\nsatisfied through involuntary diversions of federal income tax refunds for tax years 2014\nthrough 2020.

In addition to his support \nobligations and the assumption of marital debts, Applicant had to pay rent and other bills \nassociated with living apart from the marital residence. He estimates he had initially about \n$600 remaining each month after expenses. In August 2018, his older child suffered a \nhead injury. His medical insurance covered most of the treatment costs, but Applicant still \nhad to pay a $4,200 deductible. Eventually, he fell behind in car loan payments for two \nvehicles. One was repossessed in 2016 and resold at auction. The remainder after resale \nof that vehicle was $12,211 and is alleged at SOR 1.d. The other vehicle was repossessed \nand auctioned off in early 2017. The remainder after resale for that loan $6,420 and is \nalleged at SOR 1.e. Neither debt has been resolved; however, as will be discussed below, \nApplicant has sufficient funds available to him to pay both debts. (GX 1 \u2013 4; AX D; AX E; \nTr. 37 \u2013 38, 56 \u2013 59, 96 \u2013 97) \nApplicant also owed $21,363 for a delinquent debt for a credit card account as \nalleged at SOR 1.c. He testified that he incurred the debt by using the card excessively \nto make ends meet after he and his ex-wife separated. The account became delinquent \nin January 2016. In October 2021, he reached a settlement with that creditor and paid \nabout $15,000 to resolve the debt.

By the terms of a wage earners repayment plan, he was required to pay $724 each \nmonth for 60 months to resolve the debts listed in the petition. In January 2018, he was \nordered to pay $1,449 to resolve an arrearage of missed payments, and to resume his \n$724 monthly payments; however, by June 2018 had again failed to comply with the terms \nof the repayment plan and the petition was dismissed. Applicant testified that he did not \nmake the payments, in part, because of his own poor financial management practices. \nAs he testified, he \u201clost control of [his] finances and it kind of went south.\u201d (GX 5; Tr. 36 \u2013 \n38) \nAround the time the SOR was issued in October 2019, Applicant filed another \nChapter 13 petition. According to the repayment plan for that petition, he was required to \npay $985 each month for 60 months starting in November 2019. Applicant made \npayments for several months; however, at some point the monthly requirement was \nincreased to $1,707 after it was determined that not all of his liabilities had been included \nin the petition. Applicant was unable to afford that amount each month and soon fell \nbehind. In May 2021, he was ordered to resume his $1,707 payments and to pay an \nadditional $1,138 for six months to bring his account current. He could not make those \npayments and the petition was dismissed in August 2021. Over the course of 13 months \nwhile the petition was viable, Applicant made payments totaling $22,385. (Answer; GX 6; \nAX B; Tr. 68 \u2013 73) \nAfter his first Chapter 13 petition was dismissed, Applicant tried without success \nto contact the creditors listed in the SOR to resolve his debts. Before his bankruptcy \npetition, he had engaged a financial counseling company to assist in resolving his debts; \nhowever, the company he used turned out to be ineffective and unreliable. Since then, \nthe only financial counseling he has received was through the financial counseling \ncourses that are a prerequisite for filing bankruptcy. He also has engaged in various online \nself-help courses. It was not until after the failure of his second Chapter 13 petition that \nhe took further action to resolve his debts. (GX 2; Tr. 59 \u2013 63, 90) \nApplicant\u2019s father died in December 2019. Sometime in 2021, Applicant learned \nthat his father had left him an inheritance of about $70,000. That money is being managed \nby Applicant\u2019s mother, who provided him with the funds (a total of about $23,000) to pay \nthe IRS and credit card debts at SOR 1.a and 1.c, respectively. Applicant testified he used \nanother $15,000 of the inheritance to pay off the loan for the vehicle he currently drives. \nHe also has been drawing from those funds to improve his financial stability and claimed \nto have prepaid his renter\u2019s and car insurance policies, and other routine monthly \nexpenses in advance. As to the car repossession debts at SOR 1.d and 1.e, Applicant \nresumed his efforts to contact those creditors but has not yet been able to progress in \nresolving those debts. He has made arrangements to repay other debts not alleged in the \nSOR.

After regular monthly expenses, he estimates \nhe has about $1,500 remaining for debt repayments or savings. Applicant has not \nincurred any new delinquencies since the SOR debts became delinquent, and there is no \nindication he has ever missed payments on his spousal and child support obligations. (Tr. \n74 \u2013 78, 81 \u2013 83) \nApplicant files his annual income tax returns as required. For reasons already \nstated, the only time he has not paid his taxes on time was in 2015 for the 2014 tax year. \nIn his 2019 Chapter 13 petition, there is an entry showing debts for both the 2014 and \n2018 tax years. As to the 2018 tax year, available information shows that he actually owed \n$809 for that year. Applicant testified that he is unaware of any such debt and there is no \nother information in the record that would suggest he did not pay his income taxes for \n2018. (GX 6; AX B; AX M \u2013 U; Tr. 48 \u2013 56, 64 \u2013 68, 73 \u2013 74) \nApplicant received several awards and commendation while he was on active duty, \nincluding multiple Good Conduct, Army Commendation, and Army Achievement Medals. \nHe also was named Non-commissioned Officer of the Year (NCOY) for two different \ncommands. In civilian life, he has been a solid performer for his current employer. He also \nhas a good reputation among current and former associates for reliability, commitment to \nhis assigned duties, and for good character. (AX G \u2013 J; Tr. 29 \u2013 35) \nPolicies \nEach security clearance decision must be a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndetermination based on examination of all available relevant and material information, \nand consideration of the pertinent criteria and adjudication policy in the adjudicative \nguidelines (AG). (See Directive, 6.3) Decisions must also reflect consideration of the \nfactors listed in \u00b6 2(d) of the guidelines. Commonly referred to as the \u201cwhole-person\u201d \nconcept, those factors are: \n(1) The nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nThe presence or absence of a disqualifying or mitigating condition is not \ndeterminative of a conclusion for or against an applicant. However, specific applicable \nguidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against them as they \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nrepresent policy guidance governing the grant or denial of access to classified \ninformation. A security clearance decision is intended only to resolve whether it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest for an applicant to either receive or continue to have \naccess to classified information. (See Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518) \nThe Government bears the initial burden of producing admissible information on \nwhich it based the preliminary decision to deny or revoke a security clearance for an \napplicant. Additionally, the Government must be able to prove controverted facts alleged \nin the SOR. If the Government meets its burden, it then falls to the applicant to refute, \nextenuate or mitigate the Government\u2019s case. Because no one has a \u201cright\u201d to a security \nclearance, an applicant bears a heavy burden of persuasion. (See Egan, 484 U.S. at 528, \n531) A person who has access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship \nwith the Government based on trust and confidence. Thus, the Government has a \ncompelling interest in ensuring each applicant possesses the requisite judgment, \nreliability and trustworthiness of one who will protect the national interests as his or her \nown. The \u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d standard compels resolution of any \nreasonable doubt about an applicant\u2019s suitability for access in favor of the Government. \n(See Egan; AG \u00b6 2(b)) \nAnalysis \nFinancial Considerations  \nThe Government presented sufficient information to support the SOR allegations \nthat Applicant filed for bankruptcy protection in 2017 and that he incurred a significant \namount of unpaid debt that, as of the date of the SOR, had remained unresolved for \nseveral years. This information reasonably raises a security concern about Applicant\u2019s \nfinances that is articulated at AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nMore specifically, available information requires application of the following AG \u00b6 \n19 disqualifying conditions: \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income\ntax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as\nrequired. \n \n \nI have considered the following pertinent AG \u00b6 20 mitigating conditions: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority\nto file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those\narrangements. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(a) does not apply because Appellant still has unresolved debts that arose \nover several years. Accordingly, his financial problems must be viewed as frequent, \nrecent, and ongoing. \nAG \u00b6 20(b) applies because Applicant\u2019s financial problems resulted from his \ndivorce. He incurred extra expenses of supporting two residences when he and his ex-\nwife separated. Although his spousal support obligation has ended, for several years he \nwas required to pay $2,000 each month to support his ex-wife and children. The tax debt \nat SOR 1.a arose after his ex-wife unexpectedly claimed dependent exemptions on her \n2014 federal income tax return. When Applicant filed for Chapter 13 bankruptcy protection \nin 2017, it was a reasonable, albeit unsuccessful, course of action under the \ncircumstances. His second Chapter 13 petition also was a responsible way to resolve his \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                        \n \n \n \ndebts after failing to make sufficient progress in resolving his debts on his own. This \nsecond petition appears to have failed because of mistakes made in declaring the debts \nto be managed therein. Starting in the second half of 2021, Applicant has repaid two \nsubstantial debts and has positioned himself to resolve the remaining repossession debts \nwhen those creditors can be contacted. Applicant also has been managing his finances \nresponsibly and has ample cash reserves to avoid future problems. \nAG \u00b6 20(c) applies because Applicant received mandatory counseling through the \nbankruptcy process and tried to obtain reliable counseling even before his first bankruptcy \npetition. Additionally, he has avoided additional unpaid debts and his financial problems \nare under control. \nApplication of AG \u00b6 20(d) does not apply because Applicant only recently began \nrepaying his debts. Finally, AG \u00b6 20(g) applies because Applicant has repaid his 2014 tax \ndebt. \nOn balance, available information shows that Applicant\u2019s tax debt was an isolated \nevent and that his finances are unlikely to present a security concern in the future. The \nconcerns raised under this guideline are mitigated. I also have evaluated this record in \nthe context of the whole-person factors listed in AG \u00b6 2(d). Applicant\u2019s debts were not the \nresult of poor judgment or gross financial mismanagement. He acted responsibly given \nthe circumstances presented to him and his financial problems are unlikely to recur. He \nalso presented information that shows him to be of good character and reliability. The \nrecord evidence as a whole supports a fair and commonsense conclusion in favor of \ngranting his request for continued access to classified information. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required by section \nE3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.e: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the foregoing, it is clearly consistent with the interests of national \nsecurity for Applicant to have access to classified information. Applicant\u2019s request for a \nsecurity clearance is granted. \nMATTHEW E. MALONE \nAdministrative Judge \n8 \n",

After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings, testimony, and exhibits submitted, I make the following findings of fact. Applicant is 64 years old. He was married once from 2003 to 2006 and has no children. He earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in 1990. He was self-employed from 2004 to 2015 and was unemployed from approximately December 2015 to February 2017. He was underemployed until he began working for his present employer in May 2020. His current annual salary is approximately $90,000. (Transcript (Tr.) 22-27) Applicant attributed his delinquent debts to his period of unemployment and underemployment. In 2015, he lost a contract with the federal government. He attributed it to a cut in the defense budget at the time. Prior to then, he had met his financial obligations. He worked at different jobs and slowly increased his annual income. In 2019, 2 he decided to begin collecting Social Security benefits. Applicant provided a copy of his Social Security earning statement, which showed his annual earnings: 2014-$23,000; 2015-$20,000; 2016-$13,600; 2017-$25,000; 2018-$32,000; 2019-$47,000; 2020- $55,000 and 2021-$88,000.

Without objection, I \nhave taken administrative notice of the facts contained in the request. The facts are \nsummarized in the written request and will not be repeated verbatim in this decision.

(Tr. 49-55; AE I) \nApplicant inherited a house from his parents that is paid for and has no mortgage. \nHis car is paid. Since he began his current employment he has saved approximately \n$6,000 and contributed a combined amount of about $11,000 in his Individual Retirement \nAccount and his 401K pension plan. He also invested about $1,400 in stocks. Post-\nhearing, Applicant provided information that after receiving Social Security benefits he \nchanged his mind and he has repaid the Social Security Administration $17,000 that he \nreceived. He also provided an August 2009 credit report to show at that time his credit \nscore was 745. (Tr. 27- 32, 56-58; AE C, D, E, F, H) \nThe debts alleged in the SOR are corroborated by Applicant\u2019s admissions, \nstatements, and credit reports from March 2018, April 2019, February 2021, and March \n2022. (GE 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6) \nApplicant purchased a boat when he was employed and owned it for a couple of \nyears. In 2016, when he was no longer employed he was unable to make the loan \npayments. He voluntarily returned the boat to the creditor. (SOR \u00b6 1.a-$22,876) He \ndisclosed this debt on his February 2018 security clearance application (SCA) and stated \nit was resolved. In December 2018, Applicant was interviewed by a government \ninvestigator. He told the investigator that after he returned the boat to the creditor he \nbelieved the issue was resolved. He could not explain how he believed it was resolved. \nHe testified that he contacted the bank that gave him the loan for the boat in 2016, 2017 \nand 2018. The bank also contacted him wanting to collect the debt and offered him a \nsettlement of $8,000. He could not afford the settlement because he did not have the \nmoney at the time. Applicant testified that he is near retirement and does not intend to \npay this debt. Post-hearing, he stated that the debt was charged off in 2016 and the \naccount was closed in April 2021. It is unresolved. (Tr. 37-40, 55-56) \nThe debt in SOR \u00b6 1.b ($15,252) was a signature loan that Applicant obtained. He \nstopped paying the loan when he was unemployed and could not afford to pay. He \ndisclosed this debt on his SCA and said he could not afford to pay it. He told the \ngovernment investigator that he reached out to the creditor in December 2017 after he \ngot a job and was told the loan was in collection, and he would be contacted by the \ncreditor\u2019s attorneys. He testified that he was waiting to hear from the attorney and never \ndid. At that time, he made no other attempts to resolve the debt. At his hearing, he testified \nthat he did not intend to pay the debt. After his hearing, he contacted the attorney of the \ncreditor and was advised it could not locate the account. The debt is unresolved. (Tr. 34\u00ad\n37, 55-56) \nThe debt in SOR \u00b6 1.c ($5,704) was for a credit card that became delinquent in \n2016.

He provided a letter from the \nlaboratory service noting he had a zero balance. He has made a reasonable effort to \nresolve this debt. I find in his favor for this debt. (Tr. 43-47) \nApplicant testified that in June 2020, he met a woman from the Philippines through \nan Internet site. They text or talk a couple of times a day. They may have a video chat \nonce or twice a day. She told him she had lost her accounting job and was unemployed. \nIn February 2021, Applicant began sending her $400 a month and continues to do so. \nApplicant stated she is now employed, but it is not enough to support herself. He does \nnot know who her employer is, but believes it is a private company. He is unaware if she \nor her family have government contacts, but believes her parents are retired and live in \nthe country. In March 2022, he traveled to the Philippines to visit her for two weeks. He \nrefers to her as his girlfriend and confirmed he has a romantic relationship with her. He \ntold his facility security officer (FSO) about 18 months ago that he intended to travel to \nthe Philippines in the future. He did not tell his FSO about the actual trip until his return. \nHe could not recall if he told the FSO that he was visiting his girlfriend in the Philippines. \nHis estimated that his trip cost about $3,000 to $3,500. He provided documents to show \nhe received a foreign travel debrief upon his return from the Philippines in late March \n2022. His foreign travel debriefing document asked if during his foreign travel he made \nany acquaintances with any foreign nationals. He answered \u201cno.\u201d He provided a \ndocument to show he enrolled in United States Department of State Smart Traveler \nEnrollment Program indicating he was traveling to the Philippines. (Tr. 58-81; AE G) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility, the administrative judge \nmust consider the AG. In addition to brief introductory explanations for each guideline, \nthe adjudicative guidelines list potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating \nconditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified \ninformation. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere \nspeculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 states an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for financial considerations is set out \nin AG & 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nThe Appeal Board explained the scope and rationale for the financial \nconsiderations security concern in ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012) \n(citation omitted) as follows: \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an applicant might \nknowingly compromise classified information in order to raise money in \nsatisfaction of his or her debts. Rather, it requires a Judge to examine the \ntotality of an applicant\u2019s financial history and circumstances. The Judge \nmust consider pertinent evidence regarding the applicant\u2019s self-control, \njudgment, and other qualities essential to protecting the national secrets as \nwell as the vulnerabilities inherent in the circumstances. The Directive \npresumes a nexus between proven conduct under any of the Guidelines \nand an applicant\u2019s security eligibility.  \nAG \u00b6 19 provides conditions that could raise security concerns. The following are \npotentially applicable: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts;  \n(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant had delinquent debts incurred in 2016 that he was unable to pay due to \nunemployment and underemployment. He has had a well-paying job since 2020. He \ntestified that he did not intend to pay the two large delinquent debts. There is sufficient \nevidence to support the application of the above disqualifying conditions. \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising \nfrom financial difficulties. The following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially \napplicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control;  \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and  \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue. \nApplicant attributes his financial issues to a period of unemployment and \nunderemployment. He resolved one credit-card debt (SOR \u00b6 1.c) through a settlement \nagreement and payment plan. He attempted to determine the creditor for the debt in SOR \n\u00b6 1.d, but was unable. AG \u00b6 20(d) applies to the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.c and AG \u00b6 20(e) applies \nto the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.d. These debts are resolved in his favor. \nApplicant has been aware of his obligation to repay the debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and \n1.b, and has taken minimal affirmative action to contact the creditors and make payment \narrangements. He disclosed the debts on his February 2018 SCA and was questioned \nabout them by a government investigator in December 2018, which should have \nprompted him to take action, but he failed to do so. He failed to explain to the investigator \nhow he believed the issue had been resolved regarding the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.a. He testified \nthat he was waiting for a lawyer to call him regarding his delinquent loan payment in SOR \n\u00b6 1.b. He testified he did not intend to pay the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b. At \none point, Applicant was unable to pay these debts because he did not have the money. \nSome of Applicant\u2019s financial issues were beyond his control. However, he failed to \nprovide evidence that he has acted responsibly since he has been gainfully employed. \nHis failure to address his delinquent debts casts doubt on his current reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and good judgment. AG \u00b6 20(a) does not apply. AG \u00b6 20(b) has minimal \napplication. Applicant did not offer evidence that he has participated in financial \ncounseling. AG \u00b6 20(c) does not apply. \nGuideline B, Foreign Influence \nThe security concern for foreign influence is set out in AG \u00b6 6: \nForeign contacts and interests, including, but not limited to, business, \nfinancial, and property interests, are a national security concern if they result \nin divided allegiance. They may also be a national security concern if they \ncreate circumstances in which the individual may be manipulated or induced \nto help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a way \ninconsistent with U.S. interests or otherwise made vulnerable to pressure \nor coercion by any foreign interest.

The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) contact, regardless of method, with a foreign family member, business \nor professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or \nresident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of \nforeign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; and \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual's obligation to \nprotect classified or sensitive information or technology and the individual\u2019s \ndesire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing that \ninformation or technology. \nThere is a significant threat of terrorism and ongoing human rights problems in the \nPhilippines. Applicant\u2019s foreign contact creates a potential conflict of interest and a \nheightened risk of foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, and coercion, \nthrough his girlfriend. Applicant provided insufficient information about the girlfriend \nregarding her background or connection to the Philippine government. It is clear Applicant \ndid not hide that he was traveling to the Philippines, but he testified that he could not \nremember if he told his FSO that he was visiting his girlfriend in the Philippines and that \nshe is a resident and citizen of that country. His foreign travel debriefing document asked \nif during his foreign travel he made any acquaintances with any foreign nationals. He \nanswered \u201cno.\u201d Perhaps he misinterpreted the question because he already had a \nrelationship with his girlfriend, a foreign national, before he traveled. It does not appear \nhe disclosed his relationship with a foreign national before or after his travel. The above \ndisqualifying conditions have been raised by the evidence. \nConditions that could mitigate foreign influence security concerns are provided \nunder AG \u00b6 8. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country, in which \nthese persons are located, or the positions or activities of those persons in \nthat country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be placed in a \nposition of having to choose between the interests of a foreign individual, \ngroup, organization, or government and the interests of the United States;  \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of \nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, or allegiance to the group, \ngovernment, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such deep and \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \nlongstanding relationships and loyalties in the United States, that the \nindividual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the \nU.S. interest;  \n(c) contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and \ninfrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk of foreign \ninfluence or exploitation; and \n(e) the individual has promptly complied with existing agency requirements \nregarding the reporting of contacts, requests, or threats from persons, \ngroups, or organizations from a foreign country.  \nApplicant failed to provide sufficient information about his girlfriend in the \nPhilippines to make a determination that it is unlikely he will be placed in a position of \nhaving to choose between the interests of his girlfriend and the interest of the United \nStates. He testified he met her through the Internet and they text and talk often. He began \nsending her money after eight months, but could not provide detailed information about \nher employment, her contact with the Philippine government, or that of her family. \nApplicant made mostly suppositions about her and her family. He testified that he is in a \nromantic relationship with her. He first met her in person in March 2022. His contact is \nmore than casual. There is no evidence that he has advised the appropriate authorities \nthat he maintains a romantic relationship with a person in the Philippines. Applicant has \nthe burden of persuasion to show that his foreign contact does not create a security \nconcern. He has failed to provide sufficient evidence to find in his favor. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent \nto which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the \nmotivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, \nexploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or \nrecurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n       \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n   \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuidelines B and F in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were \naddressed under those guidelines, but some warrant additional comment. \nApplicant failed to meet his burden of persuasion. The record evidence leaves me \nwith questions and doubts as to his eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For \nthese reasons, I conclude Applicant failed to mitigate the security concerns arising under \nGuideline F, financial considerations and Guideline B, foreign influence. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.b: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.c-1.d: \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline B:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national security to grant Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security \nclearance.

The \nhearing was convened as scheduled. \nDepartment Counsel offered Government Exhibits (GE) 1 through 11 into \nevidence, all of which were admitted without objection. Applicant did not offer any exhibits \nduring the hearing. Applicant and a character witness (his mother) testified at the hearing. \nThe record was held open until May 13, 2022, to give Applicant the opportunity to submit \ndocumentary evidence in mitigation. He timely submitted a character letter that I marked \nas Applicant Exhibit (AE) A, and admitted into evidence without objection. DOHA received \nthe hearing transcript on May 17, 2022. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant is a 33-year-old aircraft lead mechanic, employed by a defense \ncontractor since April 2022, and was preparing to deploy to the United Arab Emirates \n(UAE) for this employer. He previously worked for another defense contractor, and \ndeployed to Iraq from November 2016 to March 2017, May to December 2017, February \nto December 2018, and May 2019 to April 2020. Applicant graduated from high school in \n2007, and has some college credits. He enlisted in the U.S. Air Force (USAF) in July \n2007, and was discharged in May 2015 with an other than honorable (OTH) discharge in \nlieu of a court-martial. Applicant held a security clearance while on active duty. Applicant \nwas married in March 2017 and divorced in August 2020. He has one child, age seven, \nwho lives with the child\u2019s mother. \nThe SOR alleges under Guideline J (criminal conduct) that Applicant was accused \nof violating a USAF no-contact order when a girlfriend claimed he struck her and sent \nover 50 text messages containing verbal attacks and profanities. He was convicted of \nwrongfully sending text messages with profanities, and received a reduction in rank, a \nfine, and a letter of reprimand. (SOR \u00b6 1.a) \nSOR \u00b6 1.b alleges that Applicant was charged in 2014, while in the USAF, with \naggravated sexual contact and kidnapping, arising from a 2012 incident, and referred to \na court-martial. SOR \u00b6 1.c alleges Applicant tested positive in April 2015, while in the \nUSAF, for oxycodone and oxymorhone, and in May 2015, he tested positive for cocaine. \nHe was charged in June 2015 with using prescription medications oxycodone and \noxymorhone, not prescribed to him, and using cocaine. The charges were referred to a \ncourt-martial. SOR \u00b6 1.d alleges he entered into a plea arrangement in October 2015 \nwherein he accepted an OTH discharge in lieu of court-martial for charges alleged in SOR \n\u00b6\u00b6 1.b and 1.c. \nSOR \u00b6 1.e alleges Applicant was arrested in March 2016 in state A, and charged \nwith domestic abuse. SOR \u00b6 1.f alleges he was arrested in state A in April 2016 and \ncharged with driving under the influence of alcohol (DUI) and driving without a driver\u2019s \nlicense.

(Ans.) \nWhile Applicant was stationed overseas on active duty, Applicant dated a local \nnational woman beginning in 2009. He claimed that they were sexually active and that at \nsome point, she claimed she was pregnant and harassed him to marry her. In 2011, she \nalleged he assaulted her and reported it to his command. As a result, he was ordered to \nhave no contact with her. However, he claims they both exchanged numerous text \nmessages that included profanities and verbal attacks toward each other, while his \ndomestic assault case was being investigated. Applicant refused non-judicial punishment, \nand was referred to a special court-martial. (Tr. 26) He was found guilty of an orders \nviolation under Article 92, Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ), for sending the \nmessages. (GE 2) \nIn his answer to the SOR, Applicant stated: \u201cI admit to violating the no contact order \nby sending text messages.\u201d He explained that he did not understand the significance of \nthe verbal order, and that he responded to her text messages since he was \u201cyoung and \nignorant.\u201d (Ans.) However, in testimony, Applicant equivocated that he did not receive \n\u201cofficial documentation\u201d of the order, and at one point, stated that he did not receive a \nverbal order. In a convoluted explanation, he testified as follows: \nApplicant: . . . Initially, though, however, the no contact order was not on \nthe official charges. And it also was initially a verbal that I, as I stated to my \nfirst sergeant at the time, was more so of in my opinion I was told hey, by \nthe way, it would be in your best interest. I did not receive any \ndocumentation that said that I was not allowed to contact her until the day \nbefore the court-martial was adjourned ultimately on March 4. And it was \u2013 \nit was eventually \u2013 the no-contact order was put on the list of -- of you know, \nI forget the word. But it was put on the list of accusation the day before. And \nthe reason why is because the \u2013 in my opinion, every other accusation was \ncompletely, utterly clear to the highest point. There was no evidence, I had \nproved that there was nothing. And at the end of the day, they came out \nand she said, yeah, he text (sic) me. And my first sergeant said, well, I told \nyou not to text her. And I said, well, I was under the impression that the text \nwas \u2013 or that he told me, you know, be in your best interest to not. As a \u2013 \nas a hey, you should keep this on, you know, keep your distance. . . . \nAdministrative Judge: All right, [Applicant], did you text her after you were \n\u2013 you received an order for no contact? \nApplicant: Yes sir. Due to \u2013 based off of my first sergeant stating that he \nordered me not to, yes. However, I was not under \u2013 I did not know I was not \nallowed to contract. When he stated it to me, I thought it was a verbal, hey, \nby the way. Because at the time, I did not receive any documentation to \nsign.

And I\u2019m \nsure Department Counsel probably does too. Did you ever receive a verbal \norder not to have any contact with her, yes or no? \nApplicant: Yes. \nApplicant explained that he believes he should have received a written order. (Tr. 26-30) \nIn 2014, an active duty female airman (victim) told a sexual assault response \ncoordinator (SARC) in State B that Applicant sexually assaulted her in State A at his off-\nbase residence in 2012. Air Force Office of Special Investigations (AFOSI) opened an \ninvestigation. (GE 4) The summary report of investigation stated that the victim said that \non November 18, 2012, she exchanged playful insults via text messages with Applicant, \nwhom she knew from previous military training together. She went to his residence to \nhave consensual sex, but Applicant became angry over the text messages. She \nattempted to leave, but Applicant knocked her to the floor, pushed her face into the carpet, \nand sexually penetrated her vagina with his finger. The victim threatened to kill Applicant \nif he did not get off of her, and she left the residence. She broke off contact with him and \ndid not know if he was still in the military when she reported the incident to the SARC. \n(GE 4) \nThe investigator contacted Mr. S, who described Applicant as his best friend until \n2012 when they had a falling out due to Applicant\u2019s involvement in a physical altercation \nwith the victim, who was previously engaged to Mr. S for a six-to-eight-month period. Mr. \nS learned of the assault from the victim, and observed bruising and swelling on her face \nafter the incident. He did not witness the altercation. Mr. S described Applicant as an \n\u201c\u2019alpha-male\u2019 type, very controlling, imposing, and manipulative.\u201d (GE 4) \nThe investigator interviewed Applicant, who stated that he met the victim in 2012 \non an online dating application. They casually dated for months before Applicant learned \nthat the victim was previously engaged to Mr. S. He stated that he broke off the \nrelationship in the fall of 2012, but the victim responded by going to his residence \nunannounced. The two engaged in a verbal altercation which ended when the victim \nkeyed Applicant\u2019s car. Applicant denied striking her or engaging in any sexual activity \nduring the altercation. \nIn his personal subject interview (PSI), Applicant admitted that he and the victim \nhad a sexual relationship, but he did not have sex with her or assault her on the date she \nreported the sexual assault. He claimed that the victim made up the story to cover herself \nwith her boyfriend [Mr. S], who learned she was having consensual sex with Applicant. \n(GE 2) In testimony, Applicant stated that he had consensual sex with the victim for about \nthree months while they dated, but not on the night she accused him of sexual assault. \nHe claimed that on that night, he confronted her about her continuing relationship with \nMr. S, her previous fianc\u00e9, and his intent to tell his friend about her. Applicant testified \nthat he could provide the victim\u2019s witness statement in which she admitted to having \nconsensual sex with Applicant that night.

An airman by the name of [victim] with whom he was \nromantically involved attempted to manipulate myself and others into \nbelieving that [Applicant] committed serious crimes against her. I was asked \nto make a statement with only half truths to go on, which I later redacted \nonce I learned the entire truth of the situation. \nThe letter extolls the \u201cupstanding character and moral fiber\u201d of Applicant, and \nattests to him being \u201cnothing but an exemplary airman for the United States Air Force and \ncarry the same core values that he encompassed in the service as a civilian.\u201d (AE A) \nDuring the pendency of a court-martial against Applicant on these allegations, he \ntested positive for oxycodone and oxymorhone in an April 2015 urinalysis, and in May \n2015, he tested positive for cocaine. (GE 5) Applicant denied using any illegal drugs or \nprescription drugs not prescribed to him. However, he claimed that he received a \nprescription through a military pharmacy for oxycodone for a spider bite after his birthday \non March 4, 2015, implying that it resulted in his positive test, but denied knowledge of \nthe positive test for cocaine. (Tr. 39-40) An AFOSI report of investigation into the positive \ntests, dated June 17, 2015, stated that Applicant\u2019s medical records showed he was \nprescribed oxycodone on March 18, 2012. The prescription expired on March 22, 2012, \nthree years before his positive urinalysis. (GE 5) \nApplicant agreed to accept an OTH discharge in June 2015, in lieu of court-martial \non the charges of sexual assault, kidnapping, and illegal use of drugs. (GE 6) He claimed \nin testimony that he agreed to the OTH because his leadership was not supporting him, \nand his discharge could be upgraded after he left the military if he could prove the charges \nagainst him were false. He has not petitioned for an upgrade of his discharge. (Tr. 40-42) \nOn March 1, 2016, Applicant was charged with domestic battery against a girlfriend \n(victim) who would later become his spouse. (GE 7, Tr. 42-43) The police report narrative \nstates that they responded to a family disturbance. The police interviewed the victim at a \ndifferent residence, and she stated that she and Applicant had been dating for several \nyears, and have been living together for about one year. The victim complained that she \nand Applicant argued because he suspected her of cheating on him. She said he grabbed \nher by the neck and pulled her head up, threw items around the house, and slashed the \ntires on her vehicle. She left the house because she was afraid he would hurt her again. \nThere were scratch marks and red spots on her neck region, extending from the right ear \nto the middle of the neck. She reported that he was at her mother\u2019s residence. The police \ninterviewed Applicant at her mother\u2019s home. Applicant stated that he and the victim were \narguing over messages on her phone from other men, and she tried to retrieve her phone \nfrom him. He said he grabbed her, threw her over his shoulders, and she landed on the \nground. He had no visible markings or injuries.

(GE 8, Tr. 54-60) \nIn contradiction to the police report narrative, Applicant claimed in his PSI and in \ntestimony, that the incident resulted from a dispute between the victim and her sister that \nhe broke up. He went to the victim\u2019s residence to pick up his \u201cgirlfriend\u2019s\u201d (victim) children, \nwhen he encountered the fight between the victim and her sister. Despite calling her his \ngirlfriend, he said in testimony that he and the victim were not together at the time, but \nrekindled their relationship in 2017. He said the victim was injured because he pulled her \noff of her sister during the fight, but did not throw her over his shoulder. Neither the fight \nbetween the two women nor the presence of the victim\u2019s sister was mentioned in the \npolice report. He claimed the victim did not appear in court to testify because the \nallegation against him was false. (GE 2, Tr. 51-60) During testimony, Applicant alluded to \nbeing able to provide his ex-wife (victim) as a witness at his hearing, but did not. (Tr. 4\n 3-\n44, 56)  \nInexplicably and in contradiction to his testimony and PSI about the incident, \nApplicant stated in his answer to the SOR \u201cI came to the defense of a brother and sister \nargument in which I was defending the woman being assaulted but when officers came, \nthe woman felt pressured to not send her family member to jail and instead me. I do have \na witness to recall my actions in the situation that I was wrongfully accused of. [emphasis \nadded]\u201d (Ans.) \nOn April 4, 2016, the police responded to a report of a suspicious car parked on \nthe road at 6:53 a.m. There was vehicle debris on the road and scrap markings on the \nroadway leading to the parked car. The car, a Dodge Charger, was running and had \ndamage to the front end and two flat and shredded tires on the passenger side. When \npolice approached Applicant in the driver\u2019s seat, he did not immediately roll down his \nwindow, but stated \u201cI\u2019m waiting for the TV match,\u201d and \u201cI\u2019m waiting for the match between \nthe two guys.\u201d He put the car in drive and drove forward about twenty yards before \nstopping again. Applicant was escorted out of the vehicle. He smelled of alcohol, and had \nvomited and urinated on himself, and was unsteady on his feet. Applicant admitted to \nconsuming vodka and driving within the past seven hours. He failed a field sobriety test, \nand was arrested. His breathalyzer tests showed BACs of .112 and .101, well over the \nlegal limit, and he was charged with DUI and having an expired driver\u2019s license. (GE 9) \nOn March 14, 2017, Applicant changed his plea to \u201cno contest\u201d and was found guilty of \nDUI. He was sentenced to unsupervised probation and fined. His probation ended on \nMarch 23, 2018. (GE 10) \nIn his PSI, Applicant claimed that he was arrested for DUI immediately after his \narrest for domestic violence, despite the fact that the DUI occurred more than one month \nafter the domestic violence arrest. He was upset and admitted the he drank too much at \na house party. He claimed that he had no intention to drive, but since he was intoxicated, \nhe decided to sleep in his running vehicle outside the house party. He claimed to have \npled guilty to the DUI charge, and was ordered to attend victim impact class, which he \ncompleted, loss of his license for six months, and fined.

Or. 10865 \n\u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR.

By its very nature, it calls into question a person\u2019s ability or \nwillingness to comply with laws, rules and regulations. \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 31 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying in this case. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) a pattern of minor offenses, anyone of which on its own would be unlikely \nto affect a national security eligibility decision, but which in combination cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s judgment, reliability, or trustworthiness; \n(b) evidence (including, but not limited to, a credible allegation, an \nadmission, and matters of official record) of criminal conduct, regardless of \nwhether the individual was formally charged, prosecuted or convicted; and \n(e) discharge or dismissal from the Armed Forces for reasons less than \n\u201cHonorable.\u201d \nApplicant\u2019s admissions, testimony, and the documentary evidence in the record \nare sufficient to establish the disqualifying conditions above. \nConditions that could mitigate criminal conduct security concerns are provided \nunder AG \u00b6 32. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur and \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; and \n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including, but not limited \nto, the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, restitution, \ncompliance with the terms of parole or probation, job training or higher \neducation, \ngood \nemployment \nrecord, \nor \nconstructive \ncommunity \ninvolvement. \nApplicant has not provided sufficient evidence in mitigation. Given the totality of \nhis involvement with domestic violence issues, drug involvement, and a DUI between \n2011 and 2016, I continue to have concerns that this pattern of misconduct and criminal \nactivity may continue given the right circumstances. He has claimed no responsibility for \nthe domestic violence incidents, and provided unconvincing, untruthful, and inconsistent \nexplanations for his involvement, contrary to the investigatory and police records. In \naddition, he claims no responsibility or acknowledgement for use of illegal drugs despite \nthe evidence and his contradictory account, and downplayed the DUI incident by claiming \nthat he did not drive the car, but simply slept in it while parked outside the location of a \nhouse party he attended, or contradictorily, stated that he was drinking in the car he was \nliving in when he was arrested. He did not testify regarding the apparent recent damage \nto the car, nor did he raise it in his PSI or SOR Answer. Applicant\u2019s accounts of the DUI \nwere contradictory and appeared untruthful. \nAlthough he has maintained employment since 2016, there has been insufficient \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ntime elapsed to show that he has left criminal activity and domestic violence against \nwomen behind. He has not provided convincing evidence to show that similar behavior \nwill not recur, or successful rehabilitation despite the passage of time since his last \nincident. Given the totality of his conduct, including his denial of drug involvement, \ninconsistent, dishonest accounts of his DUI and the incidents of violence against women, \nI remain unconvinced that his attitude or behavior has permanently changed. He has not \nbeen truthful about any of the SOR incidents, and I remain doubtful about Applicant\u2019s \nreliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment. No mitigation fully applies. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder AG \u00b6\u00b6 2(a), 2(c), and 2(d), the ultimate determination of whether to grant \nnational security eligibility must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. Under the whole-person \nconcept, the administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security \nclearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process \nfactors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d). \nI considered all of the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my findings of fact \nand comments under Guideline J in my whole-person analysis. I considered Applicant\u2019s \nwork history and overseas service, but also his OTH, court-martial charges, civilian \ndomestic abuse charge, illegal drug involvement, and DUI, and his inconsistent, dishonest \nexplanations and excuses for each. I am not convinced that Applicant is willing or able to \npermanently put his past criminal activity aside, face the truth about his actions, and show \ngood judgment in all areas of his life, especially those that are relevant to security \neligibility. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. Accordingly, I conclude he \nhas not carried his burden of showing that it is clearly consistent with the national security \ninterests of the United States to grant him eligibility for access to classified information. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \namended, as required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline J: \nAGAINST A\n PPLICANT \nAgainst Applicant \n10 \n  Subparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.f: \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n_______________________ \nConclusion \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national security interest of the \nUnited States to grant Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nApplicant\u2019s security clearance is denied. \nGregg A.

(Tr. 55-56) \nAround September 2011, Applicant was drinking, and he believed he was not \nintoxicated. (Tr. 18) The police stopped his vehicle for driving 70 miles per hour (MPH) in \na 45 MPH zone, and they arrested him for DUI. (Tr. 18, 27-28; SOR \u00b6 1.c; AE C at 18-\n19) His BAC was .08. (Tr. 56-58; AE C at 3, 20) He was convicted of DUI, and a civilian \ncourt imposed two years of probation, a $600 fine, and court costs. (AE C at 5) He \nsuccessfully completed an alcohol and substance abuse class. (Tr. 18, 28; GE 1 at 30; \nAE C at 5, 9, 13) His driver\u2019s license was suspended \u201cas a matter of law\u201d for an unspecified \nperiod.

(Tr. 28-29) He did not disclose the DUI arrest and conviction to \nhis chain of command even though he realized at that time that he had an obligation to \ndisclose it. (Tr. 26-27)     \nApplicant disclosed his 2011 DUI arrest on his August 16, 2016 SCA. (GE 1 at 28-\n29) His SCA asked whether he had been ordered, advised, or asked to seek alcohol \ncounseling or treatment in the previous seven years, and he answered, no. (Tr. 48-49; \nGE 1 at 32) Applicant said he answered, no because he believed the alcohol counseling \nor treatment question was seeking information about one-on-one counseling. (Tr. 49)      \nAround January and April 2017, Applicant was drinking, and the police stopped his \nvehicle on two occasions and arrested him for DUI. (Tr. 18-20; SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c and 1.d) As \nfor the April 2017 arrest, he was cited for DUI and driving with a suspended license. (AE \nA at 5) The police alleged Applicant failed to yield to the officer\u2019s commands, and they \npointed their firearms at him. (Tr. 37; GE 2 at 5) Applicant did not remember resisting \narrest or having firearms pointed at him. (Tr. 37-38) His first BAC from the April 2017 DUI \nwas .197, and his second BAC was .16. (GE 3 at 3, 5, 14; AE A at 2) Both DUIs were \nadjudicated in the same proceeding, and resulted in two DUI convictions. (Tr. 59) The \ndriving with suspended license was nol prossed. (AE A at 10, 12) He received a combined \nsentence, which included 12 months of probation, a $700 fine, court costs, and a \nsuspended jail sentence of 60 days. (AE A at 6; AE B at 4) He attended an alcohol and \nsubstance abuse class for 12 hours.

(Id.) \nPolicies \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the Executive \nBranch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security emphasizing, \n\u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. \n518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to control \naccess to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual \nis sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The President \nhas authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicant\u2019s eligibility for \naccess to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nabout potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Clearance \ndecisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a \ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 7. \nThus, nothing in this decision should be construed to suggest that it is based, in whole or \nin part, on any express or implied determination about applicant\u2019s allegiance, loyalty, or \npatriotism. It is merely an indication the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the \nPresident, Secretary of Defense, and DNI have established for issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). \u201cThe Directive \npresumes there is a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of \nthe Guidelines and an applicant\u2019s security eligibility. Direct or objective evidence of nexus \nis not required.\u201d ISCR Case No. 18-02581 at 4 (App. Bd. Jan. 14, 2020) (citing ISCR \nCase No. 15-08385 at 4 (App. Bd.

Dec. 19, 2002). The burden of \ndisproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-\n31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b). \nAnalysis \nAlcohol Consumption \nAG \u00b6 21 articulates the Government\u2019s concern about alcohol consumption, \n\u201c[e]xcessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable judgment or \nthe failure to control impulses, and can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability and \ntrustworthiness.\u201d \nTwo alcohol consumption disqualifying conditions could raise a security concern \nand may be disqualifying in this case. AG \u00b6\u00b6 22(a) and 22(c) provide: \n(a) alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while under \nthe influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or other \nincidents of concern, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed as \nan alcohol abuser or alcohol dependent; and \n(c) habitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point of impaired \njudgment, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed as an alcohol \nabuser or alcohol dependent. \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 22(a) and 22(c) are established. Applicant\u2019s SOR alleges four alcohol-\nrelated incidents involving the police or courts or both. In 2008, Applicant\u2019s commander \nconcluded he had engaged in drunk driving and imposed punishment under Article 15, \nUCMJ. In 2011, 2017, and 2017, he was convicted a total of three times of DUI. In his \nApril 2017 DUI, his BAC was .16. Although the term \u201cbinge\u201d drinking is not defined in the \nDirective, the generally accepted definition of binge drinking for males is the consumption \nof five or more drinks in about two hours or \u201cas a pattern of drinking alcohol that brings \nblood alcohol concentration (BAC) to 0.08 percent - or 0.08 grams of alcohol per deciliter \n- or higher.\u201d The definition of binge drinking was approved by the National Institute on \nAlcohol Abuse and Alcoholism (NIAAA) National Advisory Council in February 2004. See \nU.S. Dept. of Health and Human Services, NIAAA Newsletter 3 (Winter 2004 No. 3), \nhttps://pubs.niaaa.nih.gov/publications/Newsletter/ winter2004/Newsletter Number3.pdf; \nNIAA \nwebsite, \n\u201cDrinking \nLevels \nDefined,\u201d \nhttps://www.niaaa.nih.gov/alcohol-\nhealth/overview-alcohol-consumption/moderate-binge-drinking. His BAC for the April \n2017 DUI is high enough to establish Applicant engaged in binge-alcohol consumption to \nthe extent of impaired judgment. \n6 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFour Alcohol Consumption Mitigating Conditions under AG \u00b6\u00b6 23(a)-23(d) are \npotentially applicable: \n(a) so much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or \ngood judgment; \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her alcoholism or issues of alcohol \nabuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and \nhas established a pattern of abstinence (if alcohol dependent) or \nresponsible use (if an alcohol abuser); \n(c) the individual is a current employee who is participating in a counseling \nor treatment program, has no history of previous treatment and relapse, and \nis making satisfactory progress; and \n(d) the individual has successfully completed inpatient or outpatient \ncounseling or rehabilitation along with any required aftercare, has \ndemonstrated a clear and established pattern of modified consumption or \nabstinence in accordance with treatment recommendations, such as \nparticipation in meetings of Alcoholics Anonymous or a similar organization \nand has received a favorable prognosis by a duly qualified medical \nprofessional or a licensed clinical social worker who is a staff member of a \nrecognized alcohol treatment program. \nThe Appeal Board concisely explained Applicant\u2019s responsibility for proving the \napplicability of mitigating conditions as follows: \nOnce a concern arises regarding an Applicant\u2019s security clearance \neligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance of \na security clearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th \nCir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991). After the Government \npresents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the \napplicant to rebut or mitigate those concerns. See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. The \nstandard applicable in security clearance decisions is that articulated in \nEgan, supra. \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access \nto classified information will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nDirective, Enclosure 2 \u00b6 2(b). \nISCR Case No. 10-04641 at 4 (App. Bd. Sept. 24, 2013). \nNone of the mitigating conditions fully apply. Applicant\u2019s SOR alleges and the \nrecord establishes four alcohol-related incidents involving the police or courts or both. \nApplicant completed alcohol training, rehabilitation, or counseling programs after his \n2008, 2011, and 2017 arrests. He provided \u201ca favorable prognosis\u201d by an LCSW; \nhowever, the LCSW did not indicate that his commander determined in his NJP that he \n7 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ncommitted a drunk driving offense in 2008, and that he had three drunk driving \nconvictions. The LCSW did not indicate he had a .16 BAC for his April 2017 DUI. She \nindicated Applicant \u201chas never engaged in binge drinking or habitual drinking to the point \nof impaired judgment.\u201d (AE G at 4) Applicant\u2019s .16 BAC related to his DUI arrest is binge \ndrinking to the point of impaired judgment. His alcohol-related training, counseling, and \ntherapy ended in 2018. \nSecurity clearance cases are difficult to compare, especially under Guideline G, \nbecause the facts, degree, and timing of the alcohol abuse and rehabilitation show many \ndifferent permutations. The DOHA Appeal Board has determined in cases of substantial \nalcohol abuse that AG \u00b6 23(b) did not mitigate security concerns unless there was a fairly \nlengthy period of abstaining from alcohol consumption or responsible alcohol \nconsumption. See ISCR Case No. 06-17541 at 3-5 (App. Bd. Jan. 14, 2008); ISCR Case \nNo. 06-08708 at 5-7 (App. Bd. Dec. 17, 2007); ISCR Case No. 04-10799 at 2-4 (App. Bd. \nNov. 9, 2007). There is no bright-line time period in the Directive or Appeal Board \njurisprudence to establish rehabilitation. See ISCR Case No. 18-02526 at 3 (App. Bd. \nDec. 20, 2019) (reversing grant of security clearance in Guideline G case with two years \nof sobriety in case involving two DUI convictions); ISCR Case No 18-01926 at 4 (Sept. \n20, 2019) (reversing grant of security clearance in Guideline G case with two years of \nsobriety). \nAfter careful consideration of the Appeal Board\u2019s jurisprudence on alcohol \nconsumption and Applicant\u2019s history of alcohol consumption and rehabilitative efforts, I \nhave continuing doubts about the risks of poor decisions after excessive alcohol \nconsumption. It is too soon to conclude alcohol-related incidents involving the police and \ncourts or compromise of classified information are unlikely to recur. I have lingering \ndoubts about Applicant\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. Alcohol \nconsumption concerns are not mitigated. \nCriminal Conduct \nAG \u00b6 30 expresses the security concern pertaining to criminal conduct, \u201cCriminal \nactivity creates doubt about a person\u2019s judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. By its \nvery nature, it calls into question a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws, \nrules and regulations.\u201d \nAG \u00b6 31 describes two conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying in this case, \u201c(a) a single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses,\u201d and \u201c(c) \nallegation or admission of criminal conduct, regardless of whether the person was \nformally charged, formally prosecuted or convicted.\u201d AG \u00b6\u00b6 31(a) and 31(c) apply to the \nfour alcohol-related driving offenses discussed in the alcohol consumption section, supra.       \nAG \u00b6 32 provides four conditions that could potentially mitigate security concerns: \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and \n8 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n(b) the person was pressured or coerced into committing the act and those \npressures are no longer present in the person's life; \n(c) evidence that the person did not commit the offense; and \n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including but not limited to \nthe passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, remorse or \nrestitution, job training or higher education, good employment record, or \nconstructive community involvement. \nNone of the mitigating conditions fully apply for the reasons stated in the alcohol \nconsumption section, supra. More time must elapse without criminal conduct before \ncriminal conduct security concerns will be mitigated. \nPersonal Conduct \nAG \u00b6 15 explains why personal conduct is a security concern stating: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process. \nThe LOR alleges three disqualifying conditions in AG \u00b6 16 that are relevant in this \ncase. AG \u00b6\u00b6 16(c), 16(d)(3), and 16(e)(1) read: \n(c) credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is \nnot sufficient for an adverse determination under any other single guideline, \nbut which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-person \nassessment of questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack \nof candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations, or other \ncharacteristics indicating that the person may not properly safeguard \nprotected information; \n(d) credible adverse information that is not explicitly covered under any \nother guideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an adverse \ndetermination, but which, when combined with all available information \nsupports a whole-person assessment of questionable judgment, \nuntrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with \nrules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that the person may \nnot properly safeguard protected information. This includes but is not limited \nto consideration of: . . . (3) a pattern of dishonesty or rule violations; and \n9 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(e) personal conduct, or concealment of information about one's conduct, \nthat creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress, such as \n(1) engaging in activities which, if known, may affect the person's personal, \nprofessional, or community standing . . . . \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 16(c) and 16(d)(3) do not apply. As indicated in the previous sections, \nGuidelines J and G are the most appropriate guidelines for Applicant\u2019s conduct. The \nprevious sections indicate sufficient evidence for an adverse determination. AG \u00b6 16(e)(1) \napplies because his alcohol-related criminal conduct adversely affects his personal, \nprofessional and community standing. \nAG \u00b6 17 lists two conditions, which may mitigate security concerns in this case. \nThe three mitigating conditions are as follows: \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; and \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate vulnerability \nto exploitation, manipulation, or duress. \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 17(c) and 17(e) apply. Applicant paid his fines and expressed remorse for \nhis conduct. He is not on probation. Security officials, the courts, and law enforcement \nare aware of his misconduct, and he is not subject to coercion. Personal conduct security \nconcerns are mitigated. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept.

Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(a) \nwere addressed under those guidelines, but some warrant additional comment. \nApplicant is a 34-year-old network engineer who has worked for a defense \ncontractor for the previous six years. He served on active duty from 2005 to 2012. In \nNovember 2012, Applicant was discharged from the Air Force with an honorable \ndischarge. He received multiple certifications in information technology, including \ninformation technology security. He received a security clearance in December 2006. He \nhas worked with sensitive or classified information for almost 16 years, and he has never \nbeen accused of a security violation. \nA friend and Applicant\u2019s father, a retired Army lieutenant colonel, provided \ncharacter statements supporting reinstatement of Applicant\u2019s access to classified \ninformation. The general sense of their statements is that Applicant is knowledgeable, \nintelligent, honest, and dependable. He volunteers in his community. His resume \nindicates he has had an excellent career in network engineering and information \ntechnology. He received several Air Force awards, ribbons, and citations. He successfully \ncompleted some AF training courses. \nThe factors weighing against continuation of his security clearance are more \nsubstantial than the mitigating circumstances. Applicant had four alcohol-related incidents \nresulting in an apprehension, three arrests, imposition of NJP, and three convictions from \n2008 to 2017. His BAC for his April 2017 DUI arrest was .16. He is not currently involved \nin any alcohol counseling or treatment. He said that he continues to consume alcohol \nalbeit at a responsible level. He has had previous periods of abstinence. He did not \nprovide any statements from friends or family discussing his current level of alcohol \nconsumption. He did not timely disclose his DUI arrest in 2011 to the Air Force and his \ntwo DUI arrests in 2017 to his employer. His failure to timely disclose security relevant \nmisconduct to his employer or security is only being considered under the whole-person \nconcept and not for disqualification purposes because the failure to disclose misconduct \nwas not alleged in the SOR.  \nIt is well settled that once a concern arises regarding an applicant\u2019s security \nclearance eligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or renewal of a \nsecurity clearance. See Dorfmont, 913 F. 2d at 1401. Unmitigated security concerns lead \nme to conclude that grant of a security clearance to Applicant is not warranted at this \ntime. This decision should not be construed as a determination that Applicant cannot or \nwill not attain the state of reform necessary for award of a security clearance in the future. \nWith more time without excessive alcohol consumption and criminal conduct, he may well \nbe able to demonstrate persuasive evidence of his security clearance worthiness. \nI have carefully applied the law, as set forth in Egan, Exec. Or. 10865, the Directive, \nand the AGs, to the facts and circumstances in the context of the whole person. Personal \nconduct security concerns are mitigated; however, alcohol consumption and criminal \nconduct security concerns are not mitigated at this time. \n11 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline G: \nAGAINST APPLICANT  \nSubparagraphs 1.a through 1.d: Against Applicant \n Paragraph 2, Guideline J:  \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \n  \nAgainst Applicant \n \nParagraph 3, Guideline E:   \n \nFOR APPLICANT  \n \nSubparagraph 3.a:  \n  \nFor Applicant \nAGAINST A\n PPLICANT  \nConclusion \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_________________________ \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with national security to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance.

(Answer at 2) \nApplicant\u2019s financial problems coincided with her unsuccessful struggle to develop a \ncatering business that she started in 2005. Her record keeping was poor and income was \nerratic. (Tr. 74) She tried to make ends meet through various part-time jobs such as ride-\nsharing, house cleaning, substitute teaching, and working in retail. (GE 2 at 11; Tr. 34, 55; \nGE 1 at 18; Tr. 74) Applicant\u2019s financial problems were compounded when her son was \nborn in 2006. Because the child\u2019s father never paid child support, she faced a situation \nwhere she was simultaneously raising a child with no support, and trying to keep a \nfloundering business afloat. (Tr. 33) In early 2012, Applicant sought help from a deacon in \nher church to assist with filing her income tax returns. (Tr. 51-53) With the deacon\u2019s help, \nshe filed her federal income tax returns for 2006 to 2011.

Subparagraph 1.c is the deficiency from a car she \npurchased in 2012. (Tr. 44) After struggling to make car payments, Applicant contacted the \ncreditor to request a refinance option. (Tr. 45) She could not afford the creditor\u2019s proposal, \nwhereupon the car was voluntarily repossessed in 2013. (GE 5 at 2) In 2020, the debt was \ncancelled and reported to the Internal Revenue Service through a Form 1099-C. (AE N) \nIn 2017, Applicant met a high-ranking federal government employee by \nhappenstance. (Tr. 20) As they were talking, she mentioned the struggles with her catering \nbusiness, and sought his advice regarding a career transition. He suggested that she \nbecome a certified project manager and pursue a career in the defense contracting \nindustry. Applicant took his advice, completed the certification program, and began \napplying for jobs with various defense contractors and government agencies. (Tr. 36) \nApplicant\u2019s career change proved to be successful. By January 2021, she was \nearning $113,000 annually, and she currently earns approximately $135,000. This past \nyear, she received a $6,000 bonus. (Tr. 37) In contrast, her adjusted gross income in 2017 \nwas $29,000. (GE 2 at 40) \nAs Applicant\u2019s earnings increased, she began addressing her delinquent finances. \nIn 2018, Applicant inherited her father\u2019s house after he passed away. After selling it, she \nnetted approximately $85,000, (Tr. 74; Answer at 12) The receipt of this income facilitated \nApplicant\u2019s ability to pay the delinquent income taxes, together with bills that were not \nalleged in the SOR. (Tr. 73) She satisfied the debts alleged in subparagraph 1.a and \nsubparagraph 1.b in October 2018 and December 2018, respectively. (GE 2 at 12) In 2018, \nApplicant retained an accountant who helped her resolve her income tax delinquencies. \n(GE 1) With the accountant\u2019s help, she filed all of her remaining, late tax returns, and \nsatisfied all of the federal income tax delinquencies. (AE D \u2013 AE F, AE H) During this time, \nApplicant also satisfied the state tax liens. (AE K) The state tax liens have been \ndischarged. In sum, Applicant paid approximate $22,000 to resolve her delinquent state \nand federal income taxes.  (AE D, AE K) \n \nIn February 2020, Applicant filed her federal income tax returns for 2018 and 2019. \n(AE A) She was scheduled to receive a refund of $136. (AE A at 4) Applicant maintains a \nbudget. (GE N) She has approximately $3,000 in monthly after-expense income. (AE M at \n1) She has $1,900 deposited in a savings account, and has invested approximately \n$16,000 in an IRA account since beginning her current job in February 2021.

Egan, 484 \nU.S. 518, 528 (1988). When evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, \nthe administrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are required to be considered in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. These guidelines \nare not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, \nthese guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative \nprocess. The administrative judge\u2019s overall adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious \nscrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative \njudge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, \nfavorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 1(d) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence \nto establish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant \nis responsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must consider the \ntotality of an applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant circumstances in light of the nine \nadjudicative process factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). The factors under AG \u00b6 2(d) are as follows: \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; \n(2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; \n(3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; \n(4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; \n(5) the extent to which participation is voluntary; \n(6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent \nbehavioral changes; \n(7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and \n(9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nAnalysis \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nThe security concerns about financial considerations are set forth in AG \u00b6 18: \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet  \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information . . ..  An individual who is financially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. \nApplicant\u2019s history of financial problems and her failure to file her income tax returns \non time generate concerns under AG \u00b6 19(a), \u201cinability to satisfy debts,\u201d AG \u00b6 19(c), \u201ca \nhistory of not meeting financial obligations,\u201d and AG \u00b6 19(f), \u201cfailure to file or fraudulently \nfiling annual Federal, state, or local income tax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, \nstate, or local income tax, as required.\u201d The following mitigating conditions are potentially \napplicable: \nAG \u00b6 20(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not \ncast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \nAG \u00b6 20(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \nAG \u00b6 20(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to \nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \nAG \u00b6 20(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate \nauthority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \nBetween 2006 and 2017, Applicant filed all of her federal and state income taxes \nlate, and incurred tax delinquencies in excess of $20,000. Failure to file income tax returns \nor pay income taxes on time pose serious security concerns, as paying income taxes is a \nfundamental civic duty required by law. Applicant\u2019s failure to either file her income tax \nreturns or pay her income tax returns timely stemmed from a difficult financial situation \nposed by a struggling business, together with difficulties posed by raising a child as a \nsingle parent with no child support. After years of struggling to keep her business afloat, \nApplicant decided to switch careers. To facilitate her career change, she earned a project \nmanagement certification. Her effort to change careers was successful, as Applicant\u2019s \nearnings have increased significantly in the years following the career change. Conversely, \nshe failed to file federal income tax returns timely for ten consecutive years. Other than \ncontacting a deacon with her church in 2012 to help her file tax returns in 2012, there is \nminimal evidence of steps taken to resolve her financial problems until she obtained a well-\npaying job in 2018. Consequently, although she ultimately filed all of her income tax \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________ \nreturns, and paid the tax delinquencies and paid two of the SOR debts after ending her \ncatering business and gaining a well-paying job, AG \u00b6 20(b) and AG \u00b6 20(g) apply, but \nhave limited probative value. \nNevertheless, Applicant has satisfied all of the debts except the automobile \ndeficiency, which was legally cancelled. She currently earns more than $100,000 annually \nthan she earned in 2017, the last year that she operated the catering business, and she \nearned $85,000 after selling a house that she inherited. She maintains a budget, has \nample after-expense income, and has accrued significant savings and investments since \nswitching careers. Given her a significant increase in income through her career change \nand her inheritance windfall, Applicant\u2019s trouble keeping up with her income tax returns and \nher debts is unlikely to recur, and no longer cast doubt on her current reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment. AG \u00b6 20(a) applies. \nWhole-Person Concept \nThe nature and seriousness of Applicant\u2019s failure to file income tax returns on time \nor to pay income taxes timely is outweighed by the presence of rehabilitation and minimal \nlikelihood of recurrence evident from Applicant\u2019s significantly improved financial \ncircumstances. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.i:  \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly \nconsistent with the interests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

Applicant \nstated that he did not know why this debt became delinquent in 2017, and claims that he \npaid it in approximately February 2020. However, he did not provide sufficient \ndocumentation showing that it has been paid. (Tr. 39-41, 54; GE 3, 4, AE C) \nIn addition to the SOR debts, the record shows that Applicant owes the IRS $1,006 \nfor his 2021 taxes. He claims that the IRS assessed this amount after filing his tax return. \nHe also has a $2,193 debt for his state taxes. He set up a payment arrangement for his \nstate taxes on May 31, 2022, but did not provide sufficient documentation showing that \nhe has made any payments towards this debt. (Tr. 22-25, 43-49; AE A, H) \nApplicant stated that he earns about $90,000 annually. He reported that he does \nnot have a budget, and he failed to provide any information about his monthly expenses. \nHe asserted that he has chosen to pay his current expenses over his delinquent debts. \nHe claims that he does not have the means to resolve his bigger debts because he is \nmaking $200 monthly payments on his tax debt. He also reported that he does not have \na savings account, but that has about $70,000 in his 401K account.

In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in conjunction \nwith the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation of potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts;  \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and  \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income tax \nreturns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as required. \nThe SOR allegations (except for the 2018 tax allegations) are established by the \ninterrogatory response, tax records, credit reports, and Applicant\u2019s admissions. AG \u00b6\u00b6 \n19(a), 19(c), and 19(f) apply.  \nConditions that could mitigate the financial considerations security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 20. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and  \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority \nto file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(a) applies to SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b because applicant has filed his federal \nand state income tax returns on time since 2017. However, it does not apply to \u00b6 1.c \nbecause this tax debt is still ongoing, and he has new delinquent federal and state tax \ndebts. It also does not apply to the consumer debts in \u00b6\u00b6 1.d \u2013 1.i because these debts \n(except for 1.f) are ongoing, and he did not provide sufficient documentation showing that \nany of them became delinquent under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur. He \nprovided no documentation of his current financial situation, evidence which might \nestablish his ability to address his debts responsibly. His failure to pay his charged-off \nand delinquent debts is recent, not isolated, and is ongoing. This continues to cast doubt \non his current reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. \nAG \u00b6 20(b) partially applies to the auto loan charge-offs in \u00b6\u00b6 1.d and 1.e. While \nApplicant claimed these debts occurred due to circumstances beyond his control, he did \nnot provide sufficient documentation showing that he acted responsibly in regard to these \ndebts. There is insufficient evidence to show that his tax debt or other consumer debts \n(\u00b6\u00b6 1.c, 1.f - 1.i) occurred under circumstances beyond his control, and that he acted \nresponsibly under the circumstances. AG \u00b6 20(b) does not fully apply. \nAG \u00b6 20(d) applies to \u00b6 1.c because Applicant has been making monthly payments \non his 2016 tax debt, and to \u00b6 1.f because he has resolved that debt. AG \u00b6 20(d) does \nnot apply to \u00b6\u00b6 1.d, 1.e, 1.g \u2013 1.i because he did not provide sufficient documentation to \nshow that he has undertaken a good-faith effort to repay or resolve the remaining SOR \ndebts. \nAG \u00b6 20(g) applies to \u00b6\u00b6 1.a \u2013 1.c because Applicant has filed his delinquent \nfederal and state returns for 2016, and has timely filed his tax returns since. He also set \nup a payment plan with the IRS, and has been consistently making monthly payments on \nhis delinquent taxes for 2016. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \n6 \n\n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the potentially \ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and circumstances \nsurrounding this case. I also considered the military records provided by Applicant, and \nhis letters of recommendation. I have incorporated my comments under Guideline F in \nmy whole-person analysis. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. Applicant has new tax debts, \nand did not provide sufficient evidence to mitigate the security concerns arising out of five \nof Applicant\u2019s unresolved charged-off and delinquent consumer debts under Guideline F. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.c: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.d \u2013 1.e: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.f:  \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.g \u2013 1.i: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIt is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant a security \nclearance.

He admitted the allegation in SOR \u00b6 1.c in part and denied it in \npart. He did not expressly admit or deny the allegation in SOR \u00b6 2.a, which cross-alleges \nthe allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.d. He denied the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.b and 2.c. His \nadmissions are incorporated in my findings of fact. \nApplicant is a 33-year-old software developer employed by a defense contractor \nsince February 2022. He has worked intermittently for various federal contractors since \nMarch 2015 and worked for various non-federal employers in information-technology jobs \nsince about August 2011. He attended college from August 2007 to May 2013 and from \nJanuary to May 2014, but he has not received a degree. He has never married. He has a \nfour-year-old daughter. He received a DOD security clearance in May 2011. \nIn November 2012, Applicant was convicted in absentia of reckless driving by \nspeeding in excess of 80 miles per hour in a 45 miles-per-hour zone. He was fined $200 \nplus court costs. (GX 3.) \nIn November 2015, Applicant was charged with petit larceny from a department \nstore. A cashier in the store, who was a friend of Applicant, did not ring up everything in \nhis shopping cart. Applicant knew that his friend was not ringing up all his purchases. He \nwas stopped by a store employee, arrested by the police, and charged with petit larceny. \n(GX 2 at 7.) In November 2017, he pleaded guilty and was sentenced to 90 days in jail, \nwith 88 days suspended, and placed on probation for two years. (GX 4.) \nIn March 2016, Applicant was charged with driving while intoxicated (DWI), first \noffense. He pleaded not guilty, was convicted, was sentenced to six months in jail, with \nall but five days suspended, and fined $250. He was placed on unsupervised probation \nfor two years and his driver\u2019s license was restricted. In October 2017, he was convicted \nof violating probation, because he failed to provide documentation that he had completed \nan alcohol-education class. (GX 5.) As of the date of the hearing, his driver\u2019s license had \nnot yet been reinstated.

In August 2017, he \nwas convicted of obtaining money by false pretenses and sentenced to two years in jail, \nsuspended for two years. The charge of forgery of public records was disposed of by nolle \nprosequi. (GX 6.) \nIn January 2017, Applicant was barred from entry onto a military installation when \nauthorities discovered that his motor vehicle was improperly registered and he had \nfalsified information to register it. He had wrecked his vehicle in an accident, and he \nremoved the registration sticker from the wrecked vehicle and put it on a new vehicle. He \nused the unauthorized registration sticker to obtain a parking permit on the military \ninstallation. The illegal transfer of the sticker was discovered when he was given a ticket \nfor parking in a commuter van space. The parking ticket was dismissed. (AX A.) However, \nhe was terminated from his federal employment because the bar to entry onto the \ninstallation made him unable to perform work. (GX 7; Tr. 34-36.) He testified that the \ndebarment from the installation was eventually lifted. (Tr. 36-37.) \nIn January 2020, Applicant was terminated from another job with a defense \ncontractor for falsifying records, misrepresenting facts, and withholding information in \norder to obtain employment. After he had failed the test for certification credentials \nallowing access to a sensitive computer network, he went online and created false \ncredentials. He testified that he created the false credentials because he needed the job. \n(GX 8 and 9; Tr. 17, 36-40.) \nPolicies \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 2. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge \napplies these guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n   \n \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \n\u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 15-01253 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2016). \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, \nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-\n31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).  \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-\n20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \n \nAnalysis \nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct \nThe SOR alleges a conviction of reckless driving (SOR \u00b6 1.a), a conviction of petit \nlarceny (SOR \u00b6 1.b), a conviction of DWI and a violation of probation imposed for the DWI \n(SOR \u00b6 1.c), and a conviction of felony obtaining money by false pretenses. (SOR \u00b6 1.d). \nThe concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 30: \u201cCriminal activity creates doubt \nabout a person's judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into \nquestion a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations.\u201d \nApplicant\u2019s admissions and the evidence submitted at the hearing establish the \nfollowing disqualifying conditions under this guideline: \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 31(a): a pattern of minor offenses, any one of which on its own would \nbe unlikely to affect a national security eligibility decision, but which in \ncombination cast doubt on the individual's judgment, reliability, or \ntrustworthiness; \nAG \u00b6 31(b): evidence (including, but not limited to, a credible allegation, an \nadmission, and matters of official record) of criminal conduct, regardless of \nwhether the individual was formally charged, prosecuted, or convicted; and \nAG \u00b6 31(d): violation or revocation of parole or probation, or failure to \ncomplete a court-mandated rehabilitation program. \nThe following mitigating conditions are potentially relevant: \nAG \u00b6 32(a): so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior \nhappened, or it happened under such unusual circumstances, that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; and \nAG \u00b6 32(d): there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including, but not \nlimited to, the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, \nrestitution, compliance with the terms of parole or probation, job training or \nhigher education, good employment record, or constructive community \ninvolvement. \nNeither mitigating condition is established. Applicant\u2019s offenses are recent, \nnumerous, and did not occur under unusual circumstances. He still has not completed\nthe requirements for reinstatement of an unrestricted driver\u2019s license. His employment \nrecord is poor, characterized by failure to obey rules and falsifying credentials. He \nsubmitted no evidence of constructive community involvement.  \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \nSOR \u00b6 2.a cross-alleges the criminal conduct set out in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.d. SOR \u00b6 \n2.b alleges the conduct that resulted in Applicant being barred from entering a military \ninstallation. SOR \u00b6 2.c alleges his falsification of credentials for access to a sensitive \ncomputer system. The security concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 15: \n\u201cConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness \nto comply with rules and regulations can raise questions about an individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and ability to protect classified or sensitive information. . . .\u201d \nApplicant\u2019s admissions and the evidence submitted at the hearing establish the \nfollowing disqualifying conditions under this guideline: \nAG \u00b616(a): deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant \nfacts from any personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nor similar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment \nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine national security eligibility \nor trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities; \nAG \u00b6 16(d): credible adverse information that is not explicitly covered under \nany other guideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an adverse \ndetermination, but which, when combined with all available information, \nsupports a whole-person assessment of questionable judgment, \nuntrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with \nrules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that the individual \nmay not properly safeguard classified or sensitive information. This \nincludes, but is not limited to, consideration of . . . : a pattern of dishonesty \nor rule violations; and \nAG \u00b6 16(e): personal conduct, or concealment of information about one's \nconduct, that creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress \nby a foreign intelligence entity or other individual or group. Such conduct \nincludes . . . engaging in activities which, if known, could affect the person's \npersonal, professional, or community standing. \nAG \u00b6 16(a) is established by Applicant\u2019s falsification of his employment \nqualifications. AG \u00b6 16(d) is established by his improper transfer of the registration\ncertificate of his wrecked vehicle to another vehicle and his failure to follow the rules for\naccess to sensitive computer systems. AG \u00b6 16(e) is established by his record of criminal\nconduct, which makes him vulnerable to exploitation, manipulation, or duress and\nadversely affects his personal, professional, and community standing. \n \n \n \n \nThe following mitigating conditions are potentially applicable: \nAG \u00b6 17(a): the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; and \nAG \u00b6 17(c): the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior \nis so infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is unlikely \nto recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, trustworthiness, or \ngood judgment. \nNeither mitigating condition is established. It is not clear from the record how \nApplicant\u2019s falsification of credentials was discovered, but he did not make any effort to \ncorrect the falsification until he was caught. The violations pertaining to the registration of \nhis vehicle were arguably minor, but they were among many violations of law and \nregulations, and they did not occur under unique circumstances. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-\nperson concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process \nfactors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \nI have incorporated my comments under Guidelines J and E in my whole-person \nanalysis and applied the adjudicative factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). After weighing the disqualifying \nand mitigating conditions under Guidelines J and E, and evaluating all the evidence in the \ncontext of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has not mitigated the security concerns \nraised by his criminal conduct and personal conduct. \nFormal Findings \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \nParagraph 1, Guideline J (Criminal Conduct): AGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.d: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline E (Personal Conduct): AGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 2.a-2.c: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national security interests of the \nUnited States to grant Applicant eligibility for access to classified information. Clearance \nis denied. \nLeRoy F. Foreman \nAdministrative Judge \n7 \n",

(AE N) \nPolicies \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the Executive \nBranch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security emphasizing, \n\u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. \n518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to control \naccess to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual \nis sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The President \nhas authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicant\u2019s eligibility for \naccess to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \nIndustry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nabout potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Clearance \ndecisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a \ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 7. \nThus, nothing in this decision should be construed to suggest that it is based, in whole or \nin part, on any express or implied determination about applicant\u2019s allegiance, loyalty, or \npatriotism. It is merely an indication the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the \nPresident, Secretary of Defense, and Director of National Intelligence have established \nfor issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \n4 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR.

See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 at 2 \n(App. Bd.

Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nThe Appeal Board explained the scope and rationale for the financial \nconsiderations security concern in ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012) \n(citation omitted) as follows: \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an applicant might \nknowingly compromise classified information in order to raise money in \nsatisfaction of his or her debts. Rather, it requires a Judge to examine the \ntotality of an applicant\u2019s financial history and circumstances. The Judge \nmust consider pertinent evidence regarding the applicant\u2019s self-control, \njudgment, and other qualities essential to protecting the national secrets as \nwell as the vulnerabilities inherent in the circumstances. The Directive \npresumes a nexus between proven conduct under any of the Guidelines \nand an applicant\u2019s security eligibility. \n5 \n\n \n                                         \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \nAG \u00b6 19 includes one disqualifying condition that could raise a security concern \nand may be disqualifying in this case: \u201c(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, \nstate, or local income tax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax as required.\u201d The record establishes AG \u00b6 19(f). Discussion of this disqualifying \ncondition is contained in the mitigation section, infra. \nThe financial considerations mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are as follows: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue; \n(f) the affluence resulted from a legal source of income; and \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority \nto file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \n \nIn ISCR Case No. 10-04641 at 4 (App. Bd. Sept. 24, 2013), the DOHA Appeal \nBoard explained Applicant\u2019s responsibility for proving the applicability of mitigating \nconditions as follows:  \nOnce a concern arises regarding an Applicant\u2019s security clearance \neligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance of \na security clearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th \nCir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991). After the Government \npresents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the \napplicant to rebut or mitigate those concerns. See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.

He has no federal tax debt. A willful failure to timely make (means complete \nand file with the IRS) a federal income tax return is a misdemeanor-level federal criminal \noffense. Title 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7203, willful failure to file return, supply information, or pay tax, \nreads: \nAny person . . . required by this title or by regulations made under authority \nthereof to make a return, keep any records, or supply any information, who \nwillfully fails to . . . make such return, keep such records, or supply such \ninformation, at the time or times required by law or regulations, shall, in \naddition to other penalties provided by law, be guilty of a misdemeanor . . . . \nA willful failure to make return, keep records, or supply information when required, \nis a misdemeanor without regard to the existence of any tax liability. Spies v. United \nStates, 317 U.S. 492 (1943); United States v. Walker, 479 F.2d 407 (9th  Cir. 1973); United \nStates v. McCabe, 416 F.2d 957 (7th  Cir. 1969); O\u2019Brien v. United States, 51 F.2d 193 (7th  \nCir. 1931). For purposes of this decision, I am not weighing Applicant\u2019s failure to timely \nfile his federal income tax returns against him as crimes. In regard to the failure to timely \nfile federal income tax returns, the DOHA Appeal Board has commented: \nFailure to file tax returns suggests that an applicant has a problem with \ncomplying with well-established governmental rules and systems. Voluntary \ncompliance with such rules and systems is essential for protecting classified \ninformation. ISCR Case No. 01-05340 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 20, 2002). As we \nhave noted in the past, a clearance adjudication is not directed at collecting \ndebts. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 07-08049 at 5 (App. Bd. Jul. 22, 2008). By \nthe same token, neither is it directed toward inducing an applicant to file tax \nreturns. Rather, it is a proceeding aimed at evaluating an applicant\u2019s \njudgment and reliability. Id. A person who fails repeatedly to fulfill his or her \nlegal obligations does not demonstrate the high degree of good judgment \nand reliability required of those granted access to classified information. \nSee, e.g., ISCR Case No. 14-01894 at 5 (App. Bd. Aug. 18, 2015). See \nCafeteria & Restaurant Workers Union Local 473 v. McElroy, 284 F.2d 173, \n183 (D.C. Cir. 1960), aff\u2019d, 367 U.S. 886 (1961). \nISCR Case No. 14-04437 at 3 (App. Bd.

June 15, 2016), the Appeal Board explained \nthat in some situations, even if no taxes are owed when tax returns are not timely filed, \ngrant of access to classified information is inappropriate. In ISCR Case No. 15-1031 (App. \nBd. June 15, 2016) the applicant filed his 2011 federal income tax return in December \n2013, his 2012 federal tax return in September 2014, and his 2013 federal tax return in \nOctober 2015. He received federal tax refunds of at least $1,000 for each year. \nNevertheless, the Appeal Board reversed the Administrative Judge\u2019s decision to grant \naccess to classified information. \nIn ISCR Case No. 15-06440 at 4 (App. Bd. Dec. 26, 2017) the Appeal Board \nreversed the grant of a security clearance, discussed how AG \u00b6 20(g) applied, and noted: \nThe timing of the resolution of financial problems is an important factor in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s case for mitigation because an applicant who \nbegins to resolve financial problems only after being placed on notice that \nhis clearance was in jeopardy may lack the judgment and self-discipline to \nfollow rules and regulations over time or when there is no immediate threat \nto his own interests. In this case, Applicant\u2019s filing of his Federal income tax \nreturns for 2009-2014 after submitting his SCA, undergoing his background \ninterview, or receiving the SOR undercuts the weight such remedial action \nmight otherwise merit. \nApplicant provided some important evidence of mitigation under AG \u00b6 20(g) \nbecause he has filed all of the overdue tax returns, and he did not owe any taxes to the \nfederal government. However, under the DOHA Appeal Board jurisprudence, this is too \nlittle, too late to mitigate security concerns. He did not prove that he was unable to make \ngreater progress sooner filing his federal income tax returns. Applicant failed to establish \nmitigation of financial considerations security concerns. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \n8 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n     \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), \u201c[t]he ultimate determination\u201d of whether to grant a security \nclearance \u201cmust be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines\u201d and the whole-person concept. My comments under Guideline F are \nincorporated in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were \naddressed under that guideline but some warrant additional comment. \nApplicant is a 51-year-old mechanic who supports the Navy. In 1989, he graduated \nfrom high school, and he has not attended college. In 1993, he joined the Navy, and in \n2013, he honorably retired from the Navy as a petty officer second class. His Navy \nspecialty was mechanic and painter. His spouse is disabled and does not work outside \ntheir home. She receives $1,000 monthly from Social Security disability. Applicant is \nreceiving disability from the VA at a rating of 10 percent.   \nApplicant has sufficient financial resources to pay his debts, including his taxes. \nThe only area of financial irresponsibility is his history of failing to timely file his federal \nincome tax returns. He expressed remorse about not timely filing his federal income tax \nreturns for TYs 2013 through 2018. I am confident that he will diligently work to timely file \nhis future tax returns in the future. However, this is insufficient to establish full mitigation \nat this time. \nThe Appeal Board\u2019s emphasis on security concerns arising from tax cases is \ninstructive and binding on administrative judges. See ISCR Case No. 14-05794 at 7 (App. \nBd. July 7, 2016) (reversing grant of security clearance and stating, \u201cHis delay in taking \naction to resolve his tax deficiency for years and then taking action only after his security \nclearance was in jeopardy undercuts a determination that Applicant has rehabilitated\u201d). \nSee also ISCR Case No. 14-03358 at 3, 5 (App. Bd. Oct. 9, 2015) (reversing grant of a \nsecurity clearance, and stating \u201cA security clearance represents an obligation to the \nFederal Government for the protection of national secrets. Accordingly, failure to honor \nother obligations to the Government has a direct bearing on an applicant\u2019s reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and ability to protect classified information.\u201d). \nIn ISCR Case No. 15-03481 at 3 (App. Bd. Sept. 27, 2016), the Appeal Board \nreversed the favorable decision of the administrative judge in a case where the applicant \nfiled his 2009, 2010, and 2011 tax returns in February 2014 and his 2012 tax return in \nAugust 2015 all before the SOR was issued. The applicant in that case owed less than \n$1,800 in federal income taxes for those four TYs at the time of the decision. Id. The \nAppeal Board found the timing of the filing of his tax returns to be an important factor \nstating: \nApplicant did not resolve his tax filing delinquencies until after submission \nof his security clearance application and after undergoing his background \ninterview.

Id. \nat 5. \nApplicant may not have fully understood or appreciated the importance of the \nrequirement to timely file his federal income tax returns in the context of his eligibility for \naccess to classified information until his OPM interview. Like the applicant in ISCR Case \nNo. 15-03481, he did not establish he was unable to make greater progress sooner in the \nresolution of his tax issues. His actions under the Appeal Board jurisprudence are too \nlittle, too late to fully mitigate security concerns. See ISCR Case No. 15-03481 at 5 (App. \nBd. Sept. 27, 2016). \nIt is well settled that once a concern arises regarding an applicant\u2019s security \nclearance eligibility, there is a strong presumption against granting a security clearance. \nSee Dorfmont, 913 F. 2d at 1401. Applicant\u2019s evidence did not overcome the Dorfmont \npresumption. \nI have carefully applied the law, as set forth in Egan, Exec. Or. 10865, the Directive, \nthe AGs, and the Appeal Board\u2019s jurisprudence to the facts and circumstances in the \ncontext of the whole person. Unmitigated financial considerations security concerns lead \nme to conclude that grant of a security clearance to Applicant is not warranted at this \ntime. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:   \nAGAINST APPLICANT  \nSubparagraph 1.a: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances in this case, it is not clearly consistent with the \ninterests of national security to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security \nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nMark Harvey \nAdministrative Judge \n10 \n",

She lost her house to foreclosure, \nher car to repossession, and a number of debts became delinquent. \nThe SOR alleges $86,533 in defaulted student loans; $13,352 owed on a loan for \na car that was repossessed; four medical debts totaling $3,135; and miscellaneous \ndelinquent debts totaling $3,763. \nApplicant started addressing her problems in 2017 (before the SOR was issued), \nwith a settlement for the mortgage loan on her foreclosed home. She started a \nrehabilitation program for her student loans in October 2019. Payments have been \npaused due to COVID-19 relief. She was approved for an income-driven repayment \nplan for her student loans in June 2022. She received a small settlement from the auto \nlender for the repossessed car as part of a class action lawsuit into the lender\u2019s \npractices. As part of the settlement, the lender agreed not to collect a deficiency \nbalance and paid Applicant a small amount. Applicant paid in full one debt and is paying \nanother. \nApplicant denied owing some of the remaining debts and admitted others. She \nsuccessfully disputed the debts that she denied she owed; and the debts she admitted \nowing are no longer on her credit report. She attempted to contact those creditors, but \nshe was informed they no longer held the debt, and the creditors were not collecting the \ndebts. She has been saving money to pay the creditors if they can be located and seek \nrepayment. Her finances are now in order, with no new delinquent debts since well \nbefore the SOR was issued. \nApplicant established a plan to resolve her financial problems, and she took \nsignificant action to implement that plan. Based on the record evidence as a whole, I \nconclude that the Government established trustworthiness concerns under disqualifying \nconditions AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and 19(c). Those trustworthiness concerns are mitigated under \nthe following mitigating conditions: AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a), 20(b), 20(c), 20(d), and 20(e). \nThe concerns over Applicant\u2019s history of financial problems do not create doubt \nabout her current reliability, trustworthiness, good judgment, and ability to protect \nsensitive information. In reaching this conclusion, I weighed the evidence as a whole \nand considered if the favorable evidence outweighed the unfavorable evidence. I also \ngave due consideration to the whole-person concept. Accordingly, I conclude that she \nmet her ultimate burden of persuasion to show that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant her eligibility for access to sensitive information.

The Government offered exhibits (GE) 1 \nthrough 5, which were admitted into evidence without objection. The Government\u2019s exhibit \nlist was marked as hearing exhibit (HE) I. Applicant testified, called one witness, and \noffered exhibits (AE) A-L, which were admitted without objection. His exhibit list was \nmarked as HE II. DOHA received the hearing transcript (Tr.) on December 30, 2021. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant admitted all the SOR allegations with explanations and clarifications. His \nadmissions are adopted as findings of fact. After a thorough and careful review of the \npleadings and exhibits submitted, I make the following additional findings of fact. \nApplicant is 44 years old. He has worked for a defense contractor for approximately \n18 years. He holds a master\u2019s degree. He is married and has six children, ages 15, 14, \n10, 8, 6, and 4. He has held a security clearance for 17 years. (Tr. 31, 33; GE 1) \nThe allegations are relatively straightforward and the facts are not in dispute. The \nSOR cites seven separate security lapses under Guideline K as follows: ( 1 )  in \nMarch 2007, Applicant installed an unauthorized memory upgrade chip onto his work \ncomputer; (2) in October 2012, he brought a personal cell phone into a sensitive \ncompartmented information facility (SCIF); (3) in November 2013, he removed hand-\nwritten notes from a SCIF, that were thought to be classified, but turned out not to be \nclassified; (4) In May 2015, he failed to completely lock a security container at the end \nof the day; (5) in October 2015, he failed to re-file classified information and to lock the \nsecurity container at the end of the day; (6) in February, he removed classified \ninformation from the SCIF; and (7) in August 2018, he brought his personal cell phone \ninto the SCIF. The exact allegations are cross-alleged under Guideline E. (SOR) \nApplicant\u2019s explanation for each incident is as follows: \n1. March 2007 incident. Applicant admitted this violation. It was unintentional. \nHe was not aware that only the systems administrator could install new software or \nhardware onto his company computer. Applicant self-reported this violation once he \nrealized that he was not authorized to do what he did. There was no compromise of \nclassified information. (Tr. 26, 41, 44, 48; SOR answer; GE 4) \n2. October 2012 incident. Applicant admitted this violation. It was unintentional. \nHe realized he brought his cell phone into a secure area after about 40 minutes. \nApplicant immediately left the area and self-reported this violation. No calls were made \nor received while the phone was in the SCIF. There was no compromise of classified \ninformation. Applicant received verbal counseling. (Tr. 26, 41, 44, 48; SOR answer; GE \n5) \n3. November 2013 incident. Applicant admitted this violation. It was \nunintentional. He took notes on an index card while he was accessing classified \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ninformation. He left work for the day without realizing he had the index card in his \npocket. Upon realizing he still possessed the card, he returned the card to his workplace \nand he reported the incident to security. Upon examination by security, it was \ndiscovered that no classified information was contained on the card itself. Applicant was \ndirected to use a notebook with a classified coversheet to take notes. Applicant adopted \nthis practice and still uses it to this day. He then leaves the notebook secured in the \nSCIF. (Tr. 26, 41, 44, 48; SOR answer; GE 5) \n4. May 2015 incident. Applicant admitted this violation. It was unintentional. He \nclosed the lock, but it did not fully engage. While the container was not properly secured, \nit remained in a secure area where only cleared or escorted people have access. \nApplicant immediately self-reported this violation. There was no compromise of \nclassified information. Applicant received verbal counseling. (Tr. 26, 41, 44, 48; SOR \nanswer; GE 5) \n5. October 2015 incident. Applicant admitted this violation. It was unintentional. \nHe was distracted at the end of the day by leadership issues he was addressing and \nneglected to complete his checklist, which resulted in classified material not being \nplaced in a container and the container not being properly locked. While the container \nwas not properly secured, it remained in a secure area where only cleared or escorted \npeople have access. Applicant immediately self-reported this violation the following \nmorning. There was no compromise of classified information. Applicant received \nrefresher training. (Tr. 26, 41, 44, 48; SOR answer; GE 5) \n6. February 2016 incident. Applicant admitted this violation. It was \nunintentional. He took a printout of his personal calendar out of the SCIF. He reviewed \nthe printout while sitting in his car and realized it contained classified information. He \nimmediately returned the printout to his office and placed it in a closed area. Applicant \nimmediately self-reported this violation. There was no compromise of classified \ninformation. Applicant received verbal counseling. (Tr. 26, 41, 44, 48; SOR answer; GE \n5) \n7. August 2018 incident. Applicant admitted this violation. It was unintentional. \nHe realized he brought his cell phone into a secure area. It was there for about 20 \nminutes before he realized he had it. No classified information was discussed while he \npossessed the cell phone. Applicant immediately left the area and self-reported this \nviolation. No calls were made or received while the phone was in the SCIF. There was \nno compromise of classified information. Applicant was told to be more careful. (Tr. 26, \n41, 44, 48; SOR answer; GE 5) \nApplicant did not attempt to deflect or avoid responsibility for these security \nlapses. He accepted full responsibility for his security mistakes. Applicant works \u201chands-\non\u201d with classified information approximately 24 days a month, including multiple times \na day. By way of explanation, Applicant described some events going on in his life \nduring some of his earlier security violations. In 2013-2014, he had just assumed a \nleadership role in his company. One of his leadership tasks was to \u201cfix\u201d two broken \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nteams. There were significant personnel issues with these teams that he was trying to \novercome. Additionally, in his personal life, he was going through a major home \nrenovation, and his fourth and fifth children were born. His wife was hospitalized for \nthree months before the birth of their fourth child because of a medical condition. This \nwas a very stressful time for Applicant. (Tr. 34, 41-43) \nApplicant described the changes he has made in his work routine to ensure that \nhe follows all prescribed security protocols. He has not had a security violation in over \nthree years. The changes he implemented include: consciously slowing down at the end \nof the day to ensure he follows all the proper closing procedures; following repetitive \npatterns, such as always putting his cell phone in the same place so it is easier to check \nto see if he still possesses it; at the end of the day, he closes his office door, thereby \npreventing outside distractions from interfering with his end-of-the-day security \nprocedures. (Tr. 43-45) \nApplicant\u2019s company continues to retain confidence in him. Applicant\u2019s \nimmediate supervisor (Ms. L), who is a company vice president and who is responsible \nfor several hundred employees and contractors, testified that Applicant is currently her \ndeputy, acting in her place when she is unavailable. Ms. L has known Applicant for six \nyears and he has been her deputy for two years. She is fully aware of all the Applicant\u2019s \nsecurity incidents and the circumstances behind them. Ms. L believes that Applicant \nhas unquestioned integrity as demonstrated by his self-reporting of every security \nincident. She also described the changes she observed in Applicant\u2019s security \npractices, e.g., he no longer takes notes when reviewing material in SCIF or if he does \ntake notes he uses a notebook, which he ensures is secured before leaving the SCIF. \nMs. L strongly believes Applicant is not a security risk and recommends that his security \nclearance access continue. She also provided a written letter of support. (Tr. 22-27, 36-\n37; AE A, E) \nApplicant offered several letters of support from coworkers, church \nacquaintances, and his sister. The regional security manager for Applicant\u2019s company \ncommented on Applicant\u2019s selection for an executive growth program and that he was \na top performer. He also wrote about Applicant\u2019s security infractions, but also noted that \nApplicant always accepted responsibility and never made excuses. None of the \nincidents resulted in a compromise of classified information. He concluded his letter by \nstating: \u201cI trust [Applicant] and do not question his loyalty to the United States of \nAmerica.\u201d Three other coworkers also referenced Applicant\u2019s willingness to take \nresponsibility for his security lapses and described his strong character traits of integrity, \nreliability, and trustworthiness. (AE A, E) \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s church acquaintances describe Applicant\u2019s mentorship in youth \nprograms and his willingness to help others. He is described as selfless and committed \nto helping others. His sister described Applicant as a man of integrity who is reliable \nand trustworthy.

(AE B, F, H) \n \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), \nthe entire process is a careful weighing of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole-\nperson concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation about potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAnalysis \nGuideline K, Handling Protected Information \nAG \u00b6 33 expresses the security concern pertaining to handling protected \ninformation: \nDeliberate or negligent failure to comply with rules and regulations for \nprotecting classified or other sensitive information raises doubt about an \nindividual's trustworthiness, judgment, reliability, or willingness and ability \nto safeguard such information, and is a serious security concern. \nI have considered all the handling protected information disqualifying conditions \nunder AG \u00b6 34 and determined the following apply: \n(g) any failure to comply with rules for the protection of classified or other \nsensitive information; and   \n(h) negligence or lax security practices that persist despite counseling by \nmanagement. \nApplicant had seven documented security incidents from 2007 to 2018. AG \u00b6\u00b6 \n34(a) and 34(g) apply. \nAll the mitigating conditions for handling protected information under AG \u00b6 35 were \nconsidered and the following were found relevant under these circumstances: \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the behavior, or it has happened so \ninfrequently or under such unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur \nand does not cast doubt on the individual's current reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n(b) the individual responded favorably to counseling or remedial security \ntraining and now demonstrates a positive attitude toward the discharge of \nsecurity responsibilities; and  \n(d) the violation was inadvertent, it was promptly reported, there is no \nevidence of compromise, and it does not suggest a pattern. \nApplicant\u2019s has not had a security violation since August 2018. He is someone who \nis exposed to classified information on an almost daily basis. While his previous security \nincidents are certainly concerning, both he and his supervisor described his changed \nsecurity practices, which have prevented recurrences in the last three years. All the \nincidents were inadvertent, there was no compromise of classified information, and \nApplicant immediately reported each incident as soon as he became aware of the \nviolation. Both his current supervisor and the company security manager support his \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ncontinued access to classified information. All the above mitigating circumstances \nsubstantially apply. \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the personal conduct security concern: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. \nAG \u00b6 16: Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying \ninclude: \n(c) credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is \nnot sufficient for an adverse determination under any other single guideline, \nbut which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-person \nassessment of questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack \nof candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations, or other \ncharacteristics indicating that the individual may not properly safeguard \nclassified or sensitive information; \n(d) credible adverse information that is not explicitly covered under any \nother guideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an adverse \ndetermination, but which, when combined with all available information, \nsupports a whole-person assessment of questionable judgment, \nuntrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with \nrules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that the individual \nmay not properly safeguard classified or sensitive information.  \n(e) personal conduct, or concealment of information about one's conduct, \nthat creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress by a \nforeign intelligence entity or other individual or group. Such conduct \nincludes: \n(1) engaging in activities which, if known, could affect the person's \npersonal, professional, or community standing. \nThis case is strictly about Applicant\u2019s handling of classified information and \nfollowing proper security procedures, which is specifically covered by Guideline K (AG \u00b6\u00b6 \n34-35). Additionally, Applicant\u2019s inadvertent actions and immediate self-disclosure do not \nrise to a concern level as contemplated by AG \u00b6 16(e). None of the disqualifying \nconditions under AG \u00b6 16 apply. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n       \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I considered Applicant\u2019s multiple security \nviolations over an extended time. However, I also considered the inadvertent nature of \nthe violations, Applicant\u2019s self-reporting, taking responsibility for his violations, his \ndedication to making changes to his security practices, and the support of his supervisor, \nsecurity manager, other coworkers and acquaintances. Applicant provided sufficient \nevidence to mitigate the handling protected information security concerns. Personal \nconduct security concerns were not established. \nOverall the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant mitigated the security concerns under Guideline K and no \nindependent security concerns were established under Guideline E. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline K: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.g: \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 2.a: \nFor Applicant \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security clearance. \nEligibility for access to classified information is granted. \nRobert E.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact In Applicant\u2019s answer to the SOR, he admitted all the allegations with explanations. After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings and exhibits submitted, I make the following findings of fact. Applicant is 39 years old. He is single, never married, and has no children. He began working as an engineer for a defense contractor in 2004. His employer is subject to the drug-free workplace provisions of 41 U.S.C. 701 et seq. He holds a master\u2019s degree. He has held a security clearance for 14 years. (Tr. 18-21; GE 1) Under Guideline H, the SOR alleged Applicant used marijuana between July 2014 and July 2018, while granted access to classified information. In his answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted using marijuana during this time and stated his use was experimental. Under Guideline E, the SOR alleged Applicant used marijuana after he submitted his April 2017 security clearance application (SCA) in which he reported his previous uses between 2014 and 2016 and in which he expressed his intent not to use marijuana in the future. Applicant admitted using marijuana in 2018, after he completed his SCA.

The \ncase was assigned to me on October 21, 2021. The Defense Office of Hearings and \nAppeals (DOHA) issued a notice of hearing on November 8, 2021, and the hearing was \nheld as scheduled on December 17, 2021. The Government offered exhibits (GE) 1-2, \nwhich were admitted into evidence without objection. Two hearing exhibits (HE I and II) \nreflecting the Governments exhibit list and discovery letter were marked accordingly. \nApplicant testified and offered exhibits (AE) A-Q, which were admitted without objection. \nApplicant\u2019s exhibit list was marked as HE III. DOHA received the hearing transcript (Tr.) \non December 30, 2021. \nFindings of Fact \nIn Applicant\u2019s answer to the SOR, he admitted all the allegations with \nexplanations. After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings and exhibits \nsubmitted, I make the following findings of fact. \nApplicant is 39 years old. He is single, never married, and has no children. He \nbegan working as an engineer for a defense contractor in 2004. His employer is subject \nto the drug-free workplace provisions of 41 U.S.C. 701 et seq. He holds a master\u2019s \ndegree. He has held a security clearance for 14 years. (Tr. 18-21; GE 1) \nUnder Guideline H, the SOR alleged Applicant used marijuana between July \n2014 and July 2018, while granted access to classified information. In his answer to the \nSOR, Applicant admitted using marijuana during this time and stated his use was \nexperimental. Under Guideline E, the SOR alleged Applicant used marijuana after he \nsubmitted his April 2017 security clearance application (SCA) in which he reported his \nprevious uses between 2014 and 2016 and in which he expressed his intent not to use \nmarijuana in the future. Applicant admitted using marijuana in 2018, after he completed \nhis SCA. He further explained in his SOR answer that he was not trying to be \ndeliberately misleading when he stated in his April 2017 SCA that he would not use \nmarijuana in the future. (SOR answer) \nApplicant admitted using marijuana a total of six times between 2014 and 2018, \nfive times before completing his April 2017 SCA and one time after its completion. All \nuses were while he held a security clearance. Applicant stated that his first five uses \nwere by smoking marijuana four times and by eating a marijuana edible one time. The \nmarijuana was supplied by a friend or his then girlfriend. He was on vacation when he \nused on these occasions. He claimed that he was not aware marijuana use was wrong \nfor a security clearance holder. Given his education, length of employment by a defense \ncontractor subject to the drug-free workplace provisions of the federal statute, and his \n14 years as a clearance holder, I do not find his claim of ignorance of the prohibition of \nmarijuana use credible. He also claimed his first five marijuana uses were experimental \nand then stated in his April 2017 SCA, \u201cExperiment completed. Not needed for future \nuse.\u201d Contrary to this statement, Applicant used marijuana again when he was on \nvacation in July 2018. He met some people while partying on the street who offered him \nmarijuana, which he accepted and used. He explained his action as simply making a \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nbad decision.

He also claims he no longer associates with his former \ngirlfriend or friend who provided him with marijuana in the past. He admitted all six uses \nduring his background interview in July 2018. He claims not to have used since July \n2018. (Tr. 21-23, 27-28, 32, 36; GE 1-2) \nApplicant provided three self-procured drug tests showing negative results for the \npresence of illegal drugs. These tests results were from January 2020, November 2021, \nand December 2021. He does not think he has ever taken an employee-mandated drug \ntest. Applicant also provided a written statement of intent \u201cnever to use illegal drugs \nagain.\u201d (Tr. 23, 31; AE A, B, J, Q) \nIn September 2020, Applicant underwent a self-procured substance-abuse\nevaluation by a licensed clinical social worker and certified substance abuse counselor, \nMs. B. The evaluation consisted of an interview, a standardized drug assessment \nscreening test, and a review of the SOR. Using the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of \nMental Disorders, 5th  Edition (DSM-5), Ms. B opined that Applicant presented with \u201cno \nuse disorder\u201d and further opined that \u201cno treatment was warranted.\u201d In her evaluation \nreport, Ms. B did not address Applicant\u2019s broken pledge not to use marijuana in the \nfuture stated in his April 2017 SCA. (GE 1; AE K-L) \n \nApplicant offered character letters from six current or former coworkers with his \ncurrent employer. They discussed his good character, trustworthiness, job knowledge, \nhonesty, reliability, and integrity. Several recommended the granting of his security \nclearance. Although Applicant testified that he told the authors the reason why he was \nseeking their letters, none of the statements referenced that the authors knew about \nApplicant\u2019s use of marijuana while holding a security clearance. (AE I, P) \nApplicant offered his job performance appraisals for years 2016-2020. They \nreflected overall ratings of \u201csignificantly exceeded\u201d for 2016; \u201cachieved/substantially \nachieved\u201d for 2018 and 2019; and \u201cexceeded\u201d for 2017, 2020. Applicant also offered \nseveral certificates of appreciation noting his selection as employee of the month (twice) \nand as a significant contributor to the mission. He also provided a photo showing his \ninvolvement with a civic organization. (AE F-H, M) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG 2(a), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. \nUnder Directive section E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to \nestablish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive section E3.1.15, an \n\u201capplicant is responsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, \nextenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, \nand has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk that an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline H, Drug Involvement and Substance Abuse \nAG \u00b6 24 expresses the security concern pertaining to drug involvement: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual's reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior \nmay lead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nand regulations. Controlled substance means any \"controlled substance\" \nas defined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term \nadopted in this guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above. \nIn addition to the above matters, I note that the Director of National Intelligence \n(DNI) issued an October 25, 2014 memorandum concerning adherence to federal laws \nprohibiting marijuana use. In doing so, the DNI emphasized three things. First, no state \ncan authorize violations of federal law, including violations of the Controlled Substances \nAct, which identifies marijuana as a Schedule I controlled drug. Second, changes to \nstate law (and the laws of the District of Columbia) concerning marijuana use do not \nalter the national security adjudicative guidelines. And third, a person\u2019s disregard of \nfederal law concerning the use, sale, or manufacture of marijuana remains relevant \nwhen making eligibility decisions for sensitive national security positions. \nAG \u00b6 25 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. Those that are potentially applicable in this case include: \n(a) any substance misuse; and \n(f) any illegal drug use while granted access to classified information or \nholding a sensitive position. \nIn Between July 2014 and July 2018, Applicant used marijuana on six occasions \nwhile holding a security clearance. I find both of the above disqualifying conditions \napply. \nAG \u00b6 26 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. Two \npotentially apply in this case: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this \nproblem, and has established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not \nlimited to: \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; \nand \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that any future \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ninvolvement or misuse is grounds for revocation of national security\neligibility; and  \n \n(d) satisfactory completion of a prescribed drug treatment program,\nincluding, but not limited to, rehabilitation and aftercare requirements,\nwithout recurrence of abuse, and a favorable prognosis by a duly qualified\nmedical professional. \n \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s marijuana use was infrequent and his last use occurred over three \nyears ago, however, there are two troubling aspects about his actions that go straight to \nthe heart of his reliability, trustworthiness, and his willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. First, when he revealed his 2014-2016 use of marijuana in 2017, he \npledged not to use it again. He broke that pledge with his July 2018 use of marijuana. \nSecond, he claims that he was unaware of the prohibition against drug use, yet he has \nheld a security clearance for 14 years and his employer is bound by the federal statute \nrequiring a drug-free workplace. He had just completed his 2017 SCA less than a year \nbefore his use in 2018. I find his claim of ignorance not credible. AG \u00b6 26(a) does not \nfully apply. \nApplicant acknowledged his multiple uses of marijuana between 2014 and 2018. \nHe explained his uses between 2014 and 2016 as experimenting with marijuana. In \n2014, he was 31 years old and already held a security clearance. Even if he was \nexperimenting between 2014 and 2016, he stated in his 2017 SCA that his \nexperimenting was over. Thus, his 2018 use cannot be characterized as \nexperimentation. One thing Applicant offers to overcome his past actions is his pledge \nnot to use illegal drugs in the future. However, based upon his past broken pledge from \n2017, that is not a reliable option. While he received a substance abuse evaluation, \nthere is no evidence of his completion of a drug treatment program. AG \u00b6\u00b6 26(b) and \nAG 26(d) do not fully apply. \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the personal conduct security concern: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. \n16. Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying \ninclude: \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nsimilar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment \nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine national. \nApplicant denied that he deliberately provided false information in his 2017 \nSCA when he pledged not to use illegal drugs in the future, but then did so \nanyway in 2018. Since it cannot be established whether Applicant\u2019s stated intent \nat the time he completed his SCA was false, or whether he simply changed his \nmind after he stated his intent in the SCA, the evidence does not support a \ndeliberate falsification. Therefore, AG \u00b6 16(a) is not established. \nApplicant\u2019s use of marijuana after pledging not to do so in his 2017 SCA, \ndemonstrates questionable judgment and an unwillingness to comply with rules \nand \nregulations, \nwhich \nraise \nquestions \nabout \nApplicant\u2019s \nreliability, \ntrustworthiness, and ability to protect classified information under the general \nprovisions of AG \u00b6 15. \nI have also considered all of the mitigating conditions for personal conduct under \nAG \u00b6 17 and considered the following relevant: \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; and  \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, \nunreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely \nto recur. \nApplicant\u2019s use of marijuana, as recently as 2018, while holding a security \nclearance, and his poor judgment as demonstrated when he used marijuana despite his \nSCA written pledge not to do so cast doubt on his reliability, trustworthiness, and \njudgment. AG \u00b617(c) does not apply. Although Applicant claims he will not use illegal \ndrugs in the future, he has not obtained counseling to help correct his aberrant \nbehavior. AG \u00b6 17(d) does not apply. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n       \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guideline and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I considered Applicant\u2019s negative \ndrug tests, his written statement of intent not to use illegal drugs in the future, his \nsubstance abuse evaluation conducted by Ms. B, his education, his letters of \nrecommendation, and his job performance appraisals and awards. However, I also \nconsidered that he used marijuana in between 2014 and 2018, while holding a security \nclearance. I also considered that in 2017 Applicant pledged not to use marijuana in the \nfuture and that he broke that pledge with his use in 2018, thereby undercutting his \nreliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant failed to mitigate the security concerns arising under Guideline H, \ndrug involvement and Guideline E, personal conduct. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline H:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 1.a: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 2.a: \nAgainst Applicant \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances, it is not clearly consistent with the national \ninterest to grant Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance.

Applicant did not \nobject. I have taken administrative notice of facts contained in HE I, which are \nsummarized below. \nKyrgyzstan  \nKyrgyzstan became a Soviet republic in 1936 and achieved independence in \n1991 when the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR) dissolved. A landlocked \ncountry that borders China and maintains close ties with Russia, Kyrgyzstan is generally \nseen as the most Russia-friendly government in central Asia and it hosts four Russian \nmilitary installations. Continuing concerns for Kyrgyzstan include the trajectory of \ndemocratization, endemic corruption, a history of tense and at times violent interethnic \nrelations, border security vulnerabilities, and potential terrorist threats. \nAfter Kyrgyzstan experienced revolutions that ousted authoritarian-leaning \npresidents in 2005 and 2010, a new constitution adopted in 2010 imposed a one-term \nlimit on the presidency and converted the country to a semi-parliamentary system in \nwhich the prime minister shares executive power. Kyrgyzstan plunged into political \nupheaval in the wake of disputed October 4, 2020, parliamentary elections that heavily \nfavored pro-establishment parties. Opposition parties alleged widespread irregularities, \nincluding vote-buying and voter intimidation; international election observers deemed \nthese assertions credible. After mass protests broke out, Kyrgyzstan\u2019s central election \ncommission annulled the results on October 6, 2020, resulting in a power vacuum as \nthe prime minister and other officials announced their resignations. \nA snap presidential vote and a controversial constitutional referendum on the \ncountry\u2019s form of government took place in January 2021, raising concerns about the \nfuture of democracy and rule of law in Kyrgyzstan. Sadr Japarov, a former member of \nparliament known for his nationalist views, was elected president with 79% of the vote \namid 40% turnout, which was a lower turnout than in previous elections, and 84% of \nvoters supported reverting to a presidential system. The specifics of the planned \nconstitutional reform remain unclear. \nSince the crisis in Ukraine began in 2014, Russia has redoubled its efforts to \nreinforce its influence in central Asia. The U.S. Director of National Intelligence has \nassessed that events in Ukraine raised Russia\u2019s perceived stakes for increasing its \npresence in the region to prevent future regime change in the former Soviet republics \nand for accelerating a shit to a multi-polar world in which Russia is the uncontested \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nregional hegemon. At the same time, it is likely that China will continue to expand its \noutreach to central Asia. Kyrgyzstan has increasingly aligned its interests with Russia \nand China. \nSince March 2020, the U.S. Department of State has assessed the city of \nBishkek, the capital of Kyrgyzstan, as being a MEDIUM-threat location for terrorism \ndirected at or affecting official U.S. Government interests. Organized crime has existed \nand thrived in Kyrgyzstan since Soviet times. Significant human rights issues in \nKyrgyzstan in 2019 included: law enforcement and security services\u2019 use of torture and \narbitrary arrest; harsh and life-threatening prison conditions; political prisoners; \nsignificant problems with the independence of the judiciary; severe restrictions on free \nexpression, the press, and the internet; significant acts of corruption; trafficking in \npersons; crimes involving violence or threats of violence targeting lesbian, gay, \nbisexual, transgender, and intersex persons; and use of forced child labor. Official \nimpunity remained a problem. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant admitted SOR \u00b6 1.a and denied SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b, 2.a, and 3.a. He is 51 \nyears old. He is married to a Kyrgyzstan-born, naturalized U.S. citizen. He has four \nchildren, one is an adult from a previous relationship who is a citizen and resident of \nGermany, and three are minors from his marriage who are solely U.S. citizens residing \nwith Applicant and his spouse. (Answer; Tr. at 16; GE 1, 2) \nApplicant was born and raised in the United States. His parents and two siblings \nwere also born in and reside in the United States. He graduated from high school in \n1989, he earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in 2001, and he took classes toward but had not \nyet earned a master\u2019s degree. He served honorably in the U.S. Army from September \n1991 to August 1997; in the National Guard from August 2001 to September 2002; and \nin the Reserve from August 2001 to October 2003. He has since worked overseas for \nvarious DOD contractors, with the exception of two periods of unemployment from June \n2012 to March 2013 and April 2014 to February 2015. As of the date of the hearing, he \nworked overseas in information technology for his employer, a DOD contractor, since \nDecember 2016. He was first granted a DOD security clearance in 1991. (Answer; Tr. at \n5-6, 16-20, 63-67, 74-76; GE 1, 2) \nApplicant\u2019s 43-year-old spouse was born in Kyrgyzstan. When she was in high \nschool or college, she fulfilled her mandatory one-year service with the Kyrgyzstan \nmilitary. She does not have any other affiliations with the Kyrgyzstan military or \ngovernment. When Applicant worked in Kyrgyzstan between 2003 and 2011, he met his \nspouse there in 2004, through a mutual friend. They married in Kyrgyzstan in 2009. She \nbecame a naturalized U.S. citizen and was issued a U.S. passport in May 2010. They \nmarried in the United States in 2013, because the foreign country in which Applicant \nworked at the time did not accept his Kyrgyzstan marriage certificate. Their two eldest \nchildren were born in Kyrgyzstan, and their youngest child was born in another foreign \ncountry where Applicant worked at the time. As previously discussed, all three children \nare solely U.S. citizens, residing with Applicant and his spouse.

(Answer; Tr. at 15-16, 20-25, 48-51, 63-74, 79-81; \nGE 1, 2) \nForeign Influence \nApplicant\u2019s elderly father-in-law and mother-in-law are citizens and residents of \nKyrgyzstan. They are 78 and 73 years old, respectively. Applicant\u2019s father-in-law is a \nretired taxi driver and his mother-in-law is a retired factory worker. Now farmers in a \nrural area, they own the home in which they live. They receive a pension of \napproximately $200 monthly, but they do not have any other affiliation with the \nKyrgyzstan government. (Answer; Tr. at 20-29, 48-52, 60-74, 76-79, 81-89; GE 1, 2) \nFor a brief period in 2011, Applicant\u2019s spouse and their two eldest children lived \nwith her parents in Kyrgyzstan, while Applicant worked in a country that was not \nconducive to his family joining him. He then moved with his family to the United States \nin 2011. He and his family traveled to Kyrgyzstan to visit his parents-in-law in 2011, \ntwice in 2012, and in 2019. (Answer; Tr. at 20-29, 48-52, 60-74, 76-79, 81-89; GE 1, 2) \nApplicant\u2019s spouse has weekly telephonic contact with her parents. Applicant \noccasionally talks with his parents-in-law, on birthdays and during holidays, when his \nspouse talks to her parents. His spouse usually translates for him since he speaks \nminimal Russian. Applicant manages the finances in his household, and he and his \nspouse gift her parents approximately $100 to $200 for their birthdays. Applicant stated \nthat his parents-in-law do not know what he does for a living. He testified that he would \nreport to the U.S. authorities any attempt by anyone in Kyrgyzstan to exploit his parents-\nin-law for information about him. He has complied with his employer\u2019s reporting \nrequirements for foreign contacts. (Answer; Tr. at 20-29, 48-52, 60-74, 76-79, 81-89; \nGE 1, 2) \nApplicant has never owned property in Kyrgyzstan. When he met his spouse, she \nlived in a studio apartment in Kyrgyzstan gifted to her by her parents. She and her \nparents sold this property for approximately $25,000 USD. They used the proceeds \nfrom the sale, along with $25,000 USD that Applicant gave to his spouse, to purchase a \none-bedroom apartment in Kyrgyzstan in September 2010 for $55,000 USD. This \nproperty is solely in Applicant\u2019s mother-in-law\u2019s name. His parents-in-laws rent out the \napartment and use the rental income, of approximately $200 monthly, for living \nexpenses. (Answer; Tr. at 20, 25-26, 29, 51-60, 81-89; GE 1, 2) \nApplicant\u2019s spouse does not have any intention to manage her parent\u2019s property \nin Kyrgyzstan once her parents are unable to do so. Neither Applicant nor his spouse \nhave any financial interest in this property.

(Answer; Tr. at 20, 25-26, \n29, 51-60, 81-89; GE 1, 2) \nApplicant listed in his March 2017 security clearance application (SCA) that he \npurchased a home in the United States in April 2014. He resided in this home from April \n2014 until March 2015. His brother occasionally lived in this home while Applicant \nworked overseas. It is unclear from the record if Applicant still owns this home. The \nrecord does not contain any evidence of any other U.S.-based assets. (GE 1) \nMisuse of Information Technology and Personal Conduct \nIn June 2016, Applicant downloaded and viewed pornographic material on his \ncorporate laptop in violation of company policy. He had been working overseas for his \nthen-employer, as a federal systems technologist, since approximately January 2015. At \nthe time of the incident, he was away from his spouse; his personal laptop was broken; \nand he used his work laptop to download and view pornography at his spouse\u2019s \nsuggestion while she was on the phone with him. Although he had previously used his \nwork laptop for personal reasons, this was the only instance in which he did so for \npornography. He did not engage in this activity over a U.S. Government network. His \nsupervisor notified him in November 2016 that he violated company policy by \ndownloading inappropriate material on his company computer, and he accepted his \nsupervisor\u2019s offer to resign in lieu of termination. His employer kept him on board until \nthey found his replacement in December 2016. (Answer; Tr. at 15-16, 19, 26-48, 66-67, \n89-107; GE 1, 2) \nApplicant disclosed this information to his spouse, on his SCA, and during his \nOctober 2017 background interview. Although he used his work laptop and personal \nlaptop interchangeably, he acknowledged that he exercised bad judgment in using his \nwork laptop to download and view pornography and he should have known better since \nhe works in information technology. He did not have any previous incidents of \nunauthorized use of information technology, and as of the date of the hearing, he had \nnot had any subsequent such incidents. He received bi-annual training from his \nemployer on the rules governing the use of his work computer, and he was aware that \nhis employer prohibited personal use of his work computer. (Answer; Tr. at 15-16, 19, \n26-48, 66-67, 89-107; GE 1, 2) \nApplicant earned various information technology certificates, to include his \nCISCO certified network associate routing and switching in 2019. He provided letters of \nsupport from three individuals who attested to his trustworthiness, reliability, and \njudgment. One individual, a retired Lieutenant Commander from the U.S. Navy, came to \nknow Applicant in 2016, when Applicant served under his department in providing \nclassified and unclassified network support to military warfighters. They subsequently \nbecame colleagues in 2017, and he associated with Applicant professionally and \npersonally. The other two individuals were colleagues who have known Applicant since \n2016 and 2019, respectively.

In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. These guidelines are not \ninflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, \nadministrative judges apply the guidelines in conjunction with the factors listed in the \nadjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, \nimpartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a \nconscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d \nThe administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the \nperson, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d Under Directive \u00b6 \nE3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish controverted facts alleged \nin the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is responsible for presenting \n\u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by \nthe applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The applicant has the ultimate burden \nof persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. Section 7 of Exec. Or. 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin \nterms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty \nof the applicant concerned.\u201d See also Exec. Or. 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple \nprerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline B: Foreign Influence \nThe security concern for foreign influence is set out in AG \u00b6 6: \nForeign contacts and interests, including, but not limited to, business, \nfinancial, and property interests, are a national security concern if they \nresult in divided allegiance. They may also be a national security concern \nif they create circumstances in which the individual may be manipulated or \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a \nway inconsistent with U.S. interests or otherwise made vulnerable to \npressure or coercion by any foreign interest. Assessment of foreign \ncontacts and interests should consider the country in which the foreign \ncontact or interest is located, including, but not limited to, considerations \nsuch as whether it is known to target U.S. citizens to obtain classified or \nsensitive information or is associated with a risk of terrorism. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 7. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) contact, regardless of method, with a foreign family member, business \nor professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or \nresident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of \nforeign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual\u2019s obligation to \nprotect classified or sensitive information or technology and the \nindividual\u2019s desire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing \nthat information or technology;  \n(e) shared living quarters with a person or persons, regardless of \ncitizenship status, if that relationship creates a heightened risk of foreign \ninducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; and \n(f) substantial business, financial, or property interests in a foreign country, \nor in any foreign owned or foreign-operated business that could subject \nthe individual to a heightened risk of foreign influence or exploitation or \npersonal conflict of interest. \nThe nature of a nation\u2019s government, its relationship with the United States, \nand its human rights record are relevant in assessing the likelihood that an applicant\u2019s \nfamily members are vulnerable to government coercion. The risk of coercion, \npersuasion, or duress is significantly greater if the foreign country has an \nauthoritarian government, a family member is associated with or dependent upon the \ngovernment, or the country is known to conduct intelligence operations against the \nUnited States. In considering the nature of the government, an administrative judge \nmust also consider any terrorist activity in the country at issue. See generally ISCR \nCase No. 02-26130 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 7, 2006) (reversing decision to grant \nclearance where administrative judge did not consider terrorist activity in area where \nfamily members resided). AG \u00b6 7(a) requires substantial evidence of a \u201cheightened \nrisk.\u201d The \u201cheightened risk\u201d required to raise one of these disqualifying conditions is a \nrelatively low standard. \u201cHeightened risk\u201d denotes a risk greater than the normal risk \ninherent in having a family member living under a foreign government. \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant has never owned property in Kyrgyzstan. His spouse sold the property \nin Kyrgyzstan that she previously owned and applied the proceeds to the purchase of \nanother property in Kyrgyzstan, which is solely in her mother\u2019s name. While Applicant \ncontributed $25,000 towards the purchase of this property in 2010, neither he nor his \nspouse have any financial interest in it. Accordingly, this property does not raise a \nsecurity concern and AG \u00b6 7(f) is not established. \nApplicant\u2019s parents-in-law are citizens and residents of Kyrgyzstan. Applicant\u2019s \nspouse maintains regular contact with her parents in Kyrgyzstan by telephone and they \nhave traveled to Kyrgyzstan to visit them. Applicant\u2019s parents-in-law receive a monthly \npension from the Kyrgyzstan government. Continuing concerns for Kyrgyzstan include \nthe trajectory of democratization, endemic corruption, a history of tense and at times \nviolent interethnic relations, and border security vulnerabilities. Kyrgyzstan has \nincreasingly aligned its interests with Russia and China, and significant human rights \nissues remain in Kyrgyzstan. Applicant\u2019s relationship with his parents-in-law, through \nhis spouse, creates a heightened risk and is disqualifying under AG \u00b6\u00b6 7(a), 7(b), and \n7(e). \nAG \u00b6 8 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. The following \nare potentially applicable: \n(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in \nwhich these persons are located, or the positions or activities of those \npersons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be \nplaced in a position of having to choose between the interests of a foreign \nindividual, group, organization, or government and the interests of the \nUnited States;  \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of \nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, or allegiance to the group, \ngovernment, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such deep and \nlongstanding relationships and loyalties in the United States, that the \nindividual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the \nU.S. interest; and \n(c) contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and \ninfrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign \ninfluence or exploitation. \nAG \u00b6 8(a) is not established for the reasons set out in the above discussion \nof AG \u00b6\u00b6 7(a), 7(b), and 7(e). AG \u00b6 8(c) is also not established, as Applicant\u2019s spouse \nmaintains regular contact with her family in Kyrgyzstan, and Applicant and his family \nvisited his parents-in-law in Kyrgyzstan, as previously discussed. \nApplicant was born and raised in the United States. His parents and siblings \nwere also born in and live in the United States. He graduated from high school, earned \na bachelor\u2019s degree, and took post-graduate courses in the United States. He served \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n       \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \nhonorably in the U.S. military, the National Guard, and the Reserve, between 1991 \n(when he was first granted a security clearance) and 2003. Since 2003, with the \nexception of two periods of unemployment in 2012 and 2014, he has worked overseas \nfor various DOD contractors, to include his current employer. I considered the totality \nof Applicant\u2019s ties to Kyrgyzstan against his ties to the United States. The concerns \nover Applicant\u2019s ties to Kyrgyzstan, through his parents-in-law there, do not create \ndoubt about Applicant\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, good judgment, and ability \nto protect classified information. Applicant has met his burden of demonstrating that he \nwould resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the U.S. interest. AG \u00b6 8(b) is \nestablished. \nGuideline M: Use of Information Technology \nThe security concern for use of information technology is set out in AG \u00b6 39: \nFailure to comply with rules, procedures, guidelines, or regulations \npertaining to information technology systems may raise security concerns \nabout an individual's reliability and trustworthiness, calling into question \nthe willingness or ability to properly protect sensitive systems, networks, \nand information. Information Technology includes any computer-based, \nmobile, or wireless device used to create, store, access, process, \nmanipulate, protect, or move information. This includes any component, \nwhether integrated into a larger system or not, such as hardware, \nsoftware, or firmware, used to enable or facilitate these operations. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 40. AG \u00b6 40 (e), the \u201cunauthorized use of any information technology system,\u201d is \napplicable in this case. Applicant downloaded and viewed pornographic material on his \ncorporate laptop in June 2016, in violation of company policy. \nAG \u00b6 41 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. AG \u00b6 41(a), \n\u201cso much time has elapsed since the behavior happened, or it happened under such \nunusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the \nindividual's reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment,\u201d is applicable in this case. \nApplicant\u2019s conduct occurred over six years ago, and it was an isolated incident. He did \nnot have any previous incident of similar conduct and he has not had any subsequent \nincidents of unauthorized use of information technology. He acknowledged that he \nexercised bad judgment. He disclosed this information to his spouse, on his SCA, and \nduring his October 2017 background interview. He was aware that his employer \nprohibited personal use of his work computer. \nGuideline E: Personal Conduct \nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the security concern for personal conduct: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes.  \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. I considered the following relevant: \n(e) personal conduct, or concealment of information about one\u2019s conduct, \nthat creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress by a \nforeign intelligence entity or other individual or group. Such conduct \nincludes: . . . (1) engaging in activities which, if known, could affect the \nperson\u2019s personal, professional, or community standing.  \nApplicant downloaded and viewed pornographic material on his corporate \nlaptop in June 2016, in violation of company policy. AG \u00b6 16(e) applies. \nAG \u00b6 17 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. I considered \nthe following relevant: \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, \nunreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely \nto recur; and \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate \nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress. \nFor the reasons discussed above in my analysis under Guideline M, I find that \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 17(c), 17(d), and 17(e) are established. \nWhole-Person Concept  \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \n10 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n        \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI have incorporated my comments under Guidelines B, M, and E in my whole-\nperson analysis. After weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under these \nguidelines, and evaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole person, I \nconclude Applicant has mitigated the foreign influence, use of information technology, \nand personal conduct security concerns. Accordingly, I conclude he has carried his \nburden of showing that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant his \neligibility for access to classified information. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline B: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.a - 1.b: \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline M: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 3, Guideline E: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 3.a: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security \nclearance.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant is a 31-year-old civilian of a defense contractor who seeks eligibility to hold a public trust position. The admitted allegations are incorporated and adopted as relevant and material findings. Additional findings of fact follow. Background Applicant married in May 2020 and has two children from this marriage.

Administrative Judge \nBased upon a review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, \nApplicant did not mitigate financial consideration concerns. Eligibility for holding a public \ntrust position is denied. \nStatement of the Case \nOn October 20, 2019, the Department of Defense (DoD) Consolidated Central \nAdjudications Facility (CAF) issued a statement of reasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing \nreasons why under the financial considerations guideline the DoD could not make the \npreliminary affirmative determination of eligibility for holding a public trust position and \nand recommended referral to an administrative judge to determine whether eligibility to \nhold a public trust position should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked.

(Tr. 56-57) \n   Summary of Pleadings \nUnder Guideline F of the SOR, Applicant allegedly accumulated 20 delinquent \ndebts exceeding $27,000. Allegedly, these debts remain unresolved and outstanding. \nIn his response to the SOR, Applicant admitted most of the alleged debts with \nexplanations and clarifications. He denied the debts covered by SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c, 1.g, and \n1.i-1.t. For those debts he admitted, he claimed his inability to work out payment \narrangements with three judgment creditors covered by SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.b, and 1.d., as \nwell as a duplicated debt covered by SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.f. and 1.b. He further claimed that his \nbank account was hacked and his vehicle was repossessed (resulting in the closure of \nthe vehicle account). Addressing SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.g-1.t, he claimed to have no records of the \nrecords of the accounts being opened and in collection or delinquent status. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant is a 31-year-old civilian of a defense contractor who seeks eligibility to \nhold a public trust position.

(GEs 2-6) He attributed the debt delinquencies to family \ndeaths, recurrent unemployment, and employment transitions. (GEs 1-2; Tr. 22, 10) \nIn 2018, Applicant entered into a debt consolidation program that covered the \ndebts alleged to be delinquent in the SOR. (Tr. 23, 28) For several months, he made \nregular monthly payments totaling less than $700. (AEs A-D; Tr. 28-29) By 2019, \nApplicant was struggling with his finances again and ceased making payments under \nhis debt consolidation plan. (Tr. 22) Since letting his debt consolidation plan lapse, he \nhas made no documented payments on any of his SOR-listed debts. (GEs 2-6) While \nseveral of the alleged delinquent debts have since fallen off his credit reports, he has \nprovided no documentation of his making any payments on these debts before their \nremoval. (GEs 3-6 and AE E; Tr. 37-39, 44-62) \nApplicant\u2019s cited efforts to reach settlement agreements with creditors covered by \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a ($1,398), 1.b ($1,190), 1.e ($2,493), 1.f ($2,289), and 1.i ($112) were \nunsuccessful. (Tr. 24-25, 31, and 41-46) Each of these creditors wanted more money \nfrom Applicant than he could afford at the time. (Tr. 31, 44-46) Asked about the debts \ncovered by SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.g and 1.i-1.t, Applicant could either not recall any of these \nreported debts or he could not verify them as unpaid debts. (Tr. 46-61) However, each \nof these SOR-listed debts are revealed in his credit reports to be debts opened by him \nindividually and subsequently charged off. (GEs 2-6; Tr. 32-37) Based on the advice \ngiven him by his credit consolidation firm, he never paid or otherwise resolved these \ncovered these debts. (Tr. 35-37) \nTwo of the listed debts covered by the SOR (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b and 1.f) involve the \nsame creditor and a single default on a reported rental apartment in March 2015. (GEs \n2-5) are reported duplicates of the same rental apartment debt. (Tr. 32-33, 41-42) The \nlandlord creditor reportedly filed for monetary relief in March 2015 and obtained a \nfavorable judgment September 2016 in the amount of $1,190. (GE 3 Both debts cover \nthe same listed creditor for rental services covering the same 2015-2016 time. (GE 3) \nApplicant characterized the two debts as duplicates and the credit reports corroborate \nhis claims of duplication of these two debts. (GEs 2-3; Tr. 32-33, 41-42) \nOnly one of the listed SOR debts (a medical debt covered by SOR \u00b6 1.o for \n$796) has Applicant been able to satisfy with a documented payoff. (AE H) Applicant \nresolved this medical debt with a series of monthly payments between November 2016 \nand March 2022. (AEs F-H) \nSeveral aged and small debts (mostly medical debts resulting from medical \nemergencies) listed in the SOR could either not be recalled by Applicant or were \nbelieved to have been resolved and no longer listed in his latest credit report (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 \n3 \n\n \n \n \n                                                                                                                                              \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n               \n \n                       \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n1.m-1.t). (Tr. 46-61) He provided no documentary proof that these listed debts in his \ncredit reports were either paid or otherwise favorably resolved. \nApplicant nets approximately $3,900 a month from his job. (Tr. 64-65) Before \ntaking maternity leave, his wife earned $2,030 a month. (Tr. 65) With his wife\u2019s \nexpected additional income when she returns to her job (working mainly from home with \nher twins at her side), Applicant expects to net over $6,000 a month. (Tr. 65) He has a \ncurrent checking account balance of approximately $1,300. (Tr. 65-66) And, he has a \n401(k) retirement account funded by around $100, but he has not made any \ncontributions to the account in more than two years. (Tr. 67-68) He has no savings \naccount and has not benefitted from any financial counseling services. \nApplicant estimates a net monthly remainder of around $500 after meeting his \nmonthly expenses. (Tr. 64-65) Applicant\u2019s monthly expenses include a mortgage, car \npayment, utilities, student loan payments, and payments for general necessities. (Tr. \n69-71) After allowing for all of his monthly expenses, he estimates a net monthly \nremainder of around $500 on average. (Tr. 71) \nPolicies \nBy virtue of the jurisprudential principles recognized by the U.S. Supreme Court \nin Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988), \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a \nsecurity clearance [or public trust position].\u201d As Commander in Chief, \u201cthe President has \nthe authority to control access to information bearing on national security and to \ndetermine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such \ninformation.\u201d Id. at 527. Eligibility for access to classified information [or to hold a public \ntrust position] may only be granted \u201cupon a finding that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \nIndustry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended. \nEligibility to hold a public trust position is predicated upon the applicant meeting \nthe criteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible \nrules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines \nare applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative \njudge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe AGs list guidelines to be considered by judges in the decision-making \nprocess covering DOHA cases. The guidelines take into account factors that could \ncreate a potential conflict of interest for the individual applicant, as well as \nconsiderations that could affect the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified information. These guidelines include conditions that could raise a \ntrustworthiness concern and may be disqualifying (disqualifying conditions), if any, and \nall of the conditions that could mitigate trustworthiness concerns, if any. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n                                                                                                                                              \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n           \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n  \n \n                                                \nThese guidelines must be considered before deciding whether or not eligibility to \nhold a public trust position should be granted, continued, or denied. Although, the \nguidelines do not require judges to place exclusive reliance on the enumerated \ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions in the guidelines in arriving at a decision. \nIn addition to the relevant AGs, judges must take into account the pertinent \nconsiderations for assessing extenuation and mitigation set forth in \u00b6 2(a) of the AGs, \nwhich are intended to assist the judges in reaching a fair and impartial, commonsense \ndecision based on a careful consideration of the pertinent guidelines within the context \nof the whole person. The adjudicative process is designed to examine a sufficient period \nof an applicant\u2019s life to enable predictive judgments to be made about whether the \napplicant is an acceptable trust risk. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s conduct, the relevant guidelines are to be \nconsidered together with the following \u00b6 2(d) factors: (1) the nature, extent, and \nseriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include \nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which \nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other \npermanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation of the conduct; (8) the potential for \npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or \nrecurrence. \nViewing the issues raised and evidence as a whole, the following individual \nguidelines are pertinent herein: \nFinancial Considerations \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe Concern: Failure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy \ndebts and meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of \njudgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules or regulations, all of which \ncan raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and \nability to protect classified or sensitive information [inclusive of protected \nprivacy information] Financial distress can also be caused or exacerbated \nby, and thus can be a possible indicator of other issues of personnel \nsecurity [and trust] concern such as excessive gambling, mental health \nconditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal acts or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. . . \n.

By \nvirtue of the implied retention of ADP definitions in DoD 5200.02, ADP cases continue to \nbe covered by the process afforded by DoD 5200.6 \nFinancial concerns \nCredit reports reveal that Applicant\u2019s reported delinquent debts (except for the \nduplicated debt covered by SOR \u00b61.f and one payoff covered by SOR \u00b61.o) remain \nunaddressed and unresolved. These debt delinquencies warrant the application of two \nof the disqualifying conditions (DC) of the financial consideration guidelines: DC \u00b6\u00b6 \n19(a), \u201cinability to satisfy debts\u201d and 19(c), \u201ca history of not meeting financial obligation.\u201d \nEach of these DCs apply to Applicant\u2019s situation. \nApplicant\u2019s admitted individual debts require no independent proof to \nsubstantiate them. See Directive 5220.6 at E3.1.1.14; McCormick on Evidence \u00a7 262 \n(6th  ed. 2006). His admitted debts are fully documented and create judgment issues as \nwell over the management of his finances. See ISCR Case No. 03-01059 (App. Bd. \nSept. 24, 2004).  \nFinancial stability in a person cleared to protect sensitive privacy information is \nrequired precisely to inspire trust and confidence in the holder of a public trust position \nthat entitles the person to access protected privacy information. While the principal \nconcern of a public trust holder\u2019s demonstrated difficulties is vulnerability to coercion \nand influence, judgment and trust concerns are implicit in cases involving delinquent \ndebts. \nHistorically, the timing of addressing and resolving debt delinquencies are critical \nto an assessment of an applicant\u2019s trustworthiness, reliability, and good judgment in \nfollowing rules and guidelines necessary for those seeking eligibility to hold a public \ntrust position.

Taking into account Applicant\u2019s credited defense \ncontributions and cited failures to address his debts with the income resources available \nto him, insufficient evidence has been presented to enable him to safely maintain \nsufficient control of his finances to meet minimum standards for holding a public trust \nposition. \nI have carefully applied the law, as set forth in Department of Navy v. Egan, 484 \nU.S. 518 (1988), Exec. Or. 10865, the Directive, and the AGs, to the facts and \ncircumstances in the context of the whole person. I conclude financial considerations \npublic trust concerns are not mitigated. Eligibility for holding a public trust position is \ndenied.    \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nGuideline F (FINANCIAL CONSIDERATIONS): AGAINST APPLICANT \nFor Applicant \n8 \n Subparagraphs 1.a-1.e, 1.g-1.n, 1.p-1.t:   \n       Subparagraph 1.f and 1.o:    \n\n \n \n \n                                                                                                                                              \n                                                              \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n__________________________ \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility to hold a public \ntrust position.

Initially, she was connected with a \n\u201cmadam,\u201d who linked Applicant with clients on two separate occasions.

In 2011, when he was stationed in state A, he lived \nin a condominium that he purchased before he married Applicant. He testified that he was \nnever delinquent on his mortgage.

She met an individual through the website (Man 2) and stated, \u201cWe \nhad great conversations. Our talking on e-mails, it was very engaging.\u201d When they met \nfor the first time, for lunch, \u201c[w]e got along\u201d and lunched for two hours.

And, you know, it looked like we were \ngoing to have a second date. And so I was like, why don\u2019t you just come \nover to my place; I\u2019ll make dinner for you. Let\u2019s have a good time. And he \ncame over; we had a great time for several hours. I thought we were hitting \nit off. I thought this might lead to a third date as well. We engaged in \nconsensual sex.

(Tr. at 137-139; 172-176, 189-191; Answer; GE 2, 3, 5; AE E, F, G, J, K, DD) \nApplicant used marijuana three times: (1) in 2008, she ate a marijuana cookie \nbecause she was curious; (2) in 2012, she smoked marijuana; and (3) in 2014, she ate \nanother marijuana cookie. After she used marijuana in 2014, she felt that she did not need \nmarijuana in her life. She testified that she has no future intent to use marijuana. (Tr. at \n130-135, 160, 187; GE 1, 4, 5; AE E, F, I) \nThe first polygraph report reflects Applicant\u2019s disclosure of only her 2014 marijuana \nuse. It also reflects that Applicant referred to her ingestion of a marijuana cookie in 2014 \nas unintentional, because she did not know that her former spouse and his partner, who \nwere living with her at the time, made marijuana cookies. The second polygraph report \nreflects Applicant\u2019s disclosure of her 2012 and 2014 marijuana use. It reflects that she: \n(1) did not discuss her 2012 marijuana use during her first polygraph, because she was \nembarrassed that she had used marijuana while she was unknowingly pregnant; and (2) \nknowingly ingested a marijuana cookie in 2014, but did not discuss such knowledge \nbecause she was concerned that the recency of her use would have a negative impact \non her security processing. (GE 4, 5; AE E) \nApplicant testified that she unknowingly held a security clearance when she used \nmarijuana in 2012 and 2014. She testified that when she worked as a conference \norganizer for a DOD contracting company in state A, she did so only for the summer of \n2012, as further discussed below. She testified that although she completed an SCA \nunder the company\u2019s sponsorship that summer, she did not know the outcome of her \nsecurity clearance processing because she last spoke to the company\u2019s owner when the \nconference concluded. She testified that she was unaware she was granted a security \nclearance in 2012 until she began working for her current employer in 2015. She testified \nthat she contacted the company\u2019s owner in 2020 to ask when her security clearance was \ngranted after her completion of the 2012 SCA, because she needed to list this information \non her 2020 SCA, and his response was that he would \u201clook into it.\u201d Applicant disclosed, \nin her 2016, 2018 and 2020 SCA\u2019s, that she was granted a security clearance in \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nDecember 2012.

He hired Applicant as an \nindependent consultant for the eight-week duration of the conference, from approximately \nAugust to September 2012. She did not need a security clearance during this time, but \nhe recalled that his company sponsored her for one because it hoped to hire her \npermanently after the conference\u2019s conclusion. He stated that company records reflected \nthat Applicant completed an SCA in August 2012. He did not recall informing Applicant \nthat he was her FSO. He also did not recall having any further communication with \nApplicant after the conference ended in September 2012, to include any discussions \nabout the status of her clearance, because the opportunity to hire her permanently did \nnot pan out. He testified that he did not believe Applicant had any knowledge that her \nclearance continued to be processed after she stopped working for his company that \nSeptember. He also testified that he did not recall being notified, through the Joint \nPersonnel Adjudication System, whether Applicant\u2019s clearance had been granted, and he \ncould not recall whether Applicant was granted an interim security clearance in the short \ntime she worked for him. He testified that he only recently communicated with Applicant \nin 2020, when she sent him an email asking whether he recalled the outcome of her 2012 \nsecurity clearance processing. (Tr. at 92-113; AE C, D, AA-CC) \nApplicant acknowledged she did not disclose her marijuana use on her 2016 SCA. \nShe attributed her failure to do so to poor judgment, stating she was scared of the adverse \nimpact such a disclosure would have on her security clearance eligibility. In her 2018 and \n2020 SCA\u2019s, Applicant disclosed all three occasions in which used marijuana and she \nmarked \u201cYes,\u201d to the questions that inquired whether her marijuana use occurred while \npossessing a security clearance.

(AE R, S, T, U, W, X) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in conjunction \nwith the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision.

The protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 \n2(b) requires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national \nsecurity eligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation of potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Section 7 of Exec. Or. \n10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall \nin no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See also \nExec. Or. 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access to classified or \nsensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the security concern for personal conduct: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes.  \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. I considered the following relevant: \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar \nform used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, \naward benefits or status, determine national security eligibility or \ntrustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities; \n12 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(c) credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is \nnot sufficient for an adverse determination under any other single guideline, \nbut which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-person \nassessment of questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack \nof candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations, or other \ncharacteristics indicating that the individual may not properly safeguard \nclassified or sensitive information; and \n(e) personal conduct, or concealment of information about one\u2019s conduct, \nthat creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress by a \nforeign intelligence entity or other individual or group. Such conduct \nincludes: . . . (1) engaging in activities which, if known, could affect the \nperson's personal, professional, or community standing.  \nThe Government\u2019s basis for SOR \u00b6 1.a derives from the ROI in GE 7, and GE 7 is \nnot in evidence. Applicant denies that she married her former spouse so that he could \ncollect a housing allowance from the U.S. military under fraudulent circumstances, and \nher former spouse corroborated her testimony. Absent any further evidence, the \nGovernment failed to establish the applicability of any of the disqualifying conditions under \nAG \u00b6 16, and I find SOR \u00b6 1.a in Applicant\u2019s favor. \nApplicant has consistently maintained that she was unaware she was granted a \nsecurity clearance in 2012, until her current employer informed her so in 2015. The owner \nof the company in state A, who sponsored her for the 2012 clearance, corroborated her \ntestimony. As such, I find that Applicant illegally used marijuana in 2012 and 2014, but \nshe did not knowingly use marijuana while holding a clearance in 2012 and 2014. Thus, \nshe did not falsify her 2016 SCA by failing to disclose her use of marijuana, in 2012 and \n2014, while holding a clearance. None of the applicable disqualifying conditions under \nAG \u00b6 16 apply here and I find SOR \u00b6 1.e, in part, in Applicant\u2019s favor, and SOR \u00b6 1.f in \nApplicant\u2019s favor.  \nApplicant worked as a prostitute in 2004, and from late 2006 to early 2007. \nApplicant had an affair with Man 1 from 2004 to 2007. This affair stemmed from a ten-\nweek transactional relationship borne out of her advertisement for sexual services. \nApplicant joined a \u201csugar baby\u201d arrangement website in 2015, through which she met \nMan 2 who gave her $100 after they lunched and $300 after they had sex. Applicant \nadmitted that she knowingly falsified her 2016 SCA by failing to disclose her 2012 and \n2014 use of marijuana, because she was scared of the impact such a disclosure would \nhave on her security clearance. I find that AG \u00b6 16(a) applies, in part, to SOR \u00b6 1.e; and \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 16(c) and 16(e)(1) apply to SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b, 1.c, 1.d, and 1.e. \nAG \u00b6 17 describes the following conditions that could mitigate the personal conduct \nsecurity concerns: \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission,\nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; \n \n13 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(b) the refusal or failure to cooperate, omission, or concealment was caused \nor significantly contributed to by advice of legal counsel or of a person with \nprofessional responsibilities for advising or instructing the individual \nspecifically concerning security processes. Upon being made aware of the \nrequirement to cooperate or provide the information, the individual \ncooperated fully and truthfully; \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, \nunreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to \nrecur;  \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate vulnerability \nto exploitation, manipulation, or duress; \n(f) the information was unsubstantiated or from a source of questionable \nreliability; and \n(g) association with persons involved in criminal activities was unwitting, \nhas ceased, or occurs under circumstances that do not cast doubt upon the \nindividual's reliability, trustworthiness, judgment, or willingness to comply \nwith rules and regulations. \nThe record evidence and Applicant\u2019s testimony raise doubts about Applicant\u2019s \nreliability, trustworthiness, and judgment. Applicant did not disclose information about her \nwork as a prostitute in 2004 and 2006 to 2007 during her first polygraph, and she provided \nconflicting testimony about why she failed to do so. She testified that she: (1) incorrectly \nassumed the timeframe was beyond the relevant seven-year scope of interest; (2) was \nunder duress during both polygraphs; and (3) would have been able to disclose this \ninformation if she had more time. Although she disclosed her work as a prostitute during \nher second polygraph, she then disputed information contained therein about her need to \ncompartmentalize it and her reason for doing so. \nApplicant also made conflicting characterizations about her relationship with Man \n1. During her first polygraph, she referenced this relationship as \u201carrangement,\u201d in which \nshe was the \u201csugar baby\u201d and felt like a prostitute. She then recanted such \ncharacterizations because they did not align with her depiction of it as a loving \nrelationship, reiterating that she was under duress when she unfavorably characterized \nher relationship with Man 1 in her first polygraph. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n14 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant also made conflicting characterizations about her intentions behind \njoining the website in 2015 and her interaction with Man 2. On one hand, she confirmed, \nduring her second polygraph, that the \u201csugar baby\u201d website implied a willingness to be in \nan \u201carrangement.\u201d But she then testified that she joined the website to simply meet new \npeople and date. She also recanted the indication she made, during her second \npolygraph, that she knew the $300 Man 2 left her was for the sex they had, testifying that \nshe found the gesture insulting and misread their interaction. \nApplicant did not make any efforts to disclose her 2012 and 2014 marijuana use \nafter knowingly omitting it from her 2016 SCA. When she disclosed only her 2014 \nmarijuana use during her first polygraph, she characterized this use as an unintentional \ningestion of a marijuana cookie. When she disclosed both her 2012 and 2014 marijuana \nuse during her second polygraph, she acknowledged that she: (1) did not discuss her \n2012 marijuana use during her first polygraph because she was embarrassed; (2) \nintentionally ingested the marijuana cookie in 2014; and (3) was concerned that the \nrecency of her 2014 marijuana use would have a negative impact on her security \nprocessing. \nI did not find Applicant to be candid or credible at the hearing. Her testimony was \ninconsistent, in contradiction of the record evidence, and not credible in light of the record \nevidence. Her failure to truthfully disclose her marijuana use on her 2016 SCA also weighs \nagainst any mitigation, rehabilitation, and favorable conclusions concerning her \ncredibility. AG \u00b6\u00b6 17(a) to 17(g) do not apply. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the potentially \ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and circumstances \nsurrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under Guideline E in my whole-\nperson analysis. Overall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to \n15 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude Applicant failed to \nmitigate the personal conduct security concerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline E:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a and 1.f: \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \nSubparagraphs 1.b - 1.e:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n Conclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security \nclearance.

A hearing was scheduled for July 27, 2022, \nvia TEAMS, and was heard on the scheduled date. At the hearing, the Government\u2019s \ncase consisted of eight exhibits. (GEs 1-8) Applicant relied on one witness (herself) and \ntwo exhibits. The transcript (Tr.) was received on August 4, 2002.  \nProcedural Issues \nBefore the close of the hearing, Applicant requested the record be kept open to \npermit her the opportunity to supplement the record with documentation of her \npayments to her SOR-listed creditors. For good cause shown, Applicant was granted \nseven calendar days to supplement the record. Department Counsel was afforded \nseven days to respond. Within the time permitted, Applicant supplemented the record \nwith documented payoffs of SOR creditors \u00b6\u00b6 1.c and 1.d. She reported unsuccessful \nattempts to obtain identifying information on her remaining accounts. Applicant\u2019s post-\nhearing submissions were admitted without objections as AEs B-D. A hearing \nsubmission documenting a dismissal of a non-SOR hospital debt is admitted as well as \nAE E. \nSummary of Pleadings \nUnder Guideline F of the SOR, Applicant (a) petitioned for Chapter 13 bankruptcy \nrelief in May 2015, a petition which was dismissed in April 2016 for inability to file an \nacceptable plan, and (b) accumulated eight delinquent medical and consumer debts \nexceeding $42,000. Allegedly, these debts have not been resolved. \nIn her response to the SOR, Applicant admitted her petitioning for Chapter 13 \nbankruptcy relief in May 2015, but denied each of the alleged delinquent debts, claiming \nthe accounts either no longer existed or \u201cwere being taken care of.\u201d See Applicant\u2019s \nsupplemental response. She also claimed that her Chapter 13 bankruptcy petition was \ndismissed because the court raised the amount of her monthly payments to an amount \nwhich she could not afford. In her supplemental response (undated), she corrected her \nanswers and admitted all of the SOR allegations with explanations. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant is a 55-year-old civilian of a defense contractor who seeks a. security \nclearance.

(GE 2) \nApplicant\u2019s finances \nBurdened by her ongoing efforts to help her family at home, she petitioned for \nChapter 13 bankruptcy relief in May 2015. (GE 3; Tr. 24) In her bankruptcy petition, she \nscheduled real property totaling $351,971 and personal property totaling $41,234. (GE \n3) On the liability side of her reported accounts, she scheduled secured claims of \n$339,940 and unsecured non-priority claims of $88,812.

(GEs 1 and 3; Tr. 24, 33-34) \nBankruptcy records and credit reports document Applicant\u2019s (a) petition for \nChapter 13 bankruptcy relief and (b) her accumulation of eight delinquent debts \nbetween 2011 and July 2022, exceeding $42,000. (GEs 4-8) Applicant attributed her \ndebt delinquencies to providing financial assistance to her family members (i.e., to the \nsister of her child, as well as to funds she expended to further her education. (Tr. 25, \n31-32) \nIncluded SOR debts are as follows: 1.b (a utility debt for $439); 1.c (a federal \nloan for $23,768), 1.d (a commercial loan for $10,677); 1.e (a collateralized car loan \nwith $3,375 in past due payments on an overall balance of $48,234); 1.f (a credit card \ndebt for $2,356); 1.g (a utility debt for $1,395); 1.h (a medical debt for $891); and 1.i (a \nconsumer debt for $242). (GEs 3-8) These debts are listed in Applicant\u2019s credit reports \nas unresolved and outstanding. (GEs 4-8) Shortly after her Chapter 13 bankruptcy \npetition was dismissed, Applicant retained a credit repairing firm to help her ensure that \nher reported delinquent debts were accurate. (Tr. 34) Once these reported debts were \nverified, she contacted the creditors herself to try to make settlement arrangements with \nthe identified creditors. (Tr. 34-35) \nApplicant was able to make contact with her SOR creditors. However, she was \nonly successful in documenting her payoffs of creditors covered by SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c and 1.d. \n(AEs A-D; Tr. 37-39) These documented payoffs for reduced amounts covered over \n$34,000 of the total debt amounts listed in the SOR and represent two of her largest \ndebts.

(GEs \n7-8) Applicant\u2019s claims that she has made more recent payments and is current with this \nloan account are not documented and cannot be accepted without verification. (Tr. 40-\n42)  \nPromising at hearing to provide post-hearing documentation of the current status \nof her SOR \u00b6 1.e account, Applicant did not provide any updated verification of the \ncurrent status of the account, citing her \u201cinability to get more information on the \naccounts in question.\u201d (AE B) Based on available information, Applicant\u2019s loan \ndeficiency with her car loan remains unpaid and unresolved. Applicant\u2019s remaining \ndebts covered by the SOR (1.b and 1.e-1.i) remain unpaid and unresolved as well. \nWhile most of these debts have fallen off of her most recent credit reports (notably \ndebts covered by SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b and 1.e-1.i), age (and not payment) of the debts is \ninferentially the most likely reason for their more recent disappearance from Applicant\u2019s \ncredit reports. Without more documented verification clarification from Applicant, \nfavorable inferences of voluntary, good-faith resolution of these debts cannot be drawn. \nOne of the debts Applicant addressed is a non-SOR debt covering a hospital \ndebt was dismissed by a court presiding over the creditor\u2019s complaint.

While the principal concern of a \nsecurity clearance holder\u2019s demonstrated difficulties is vulnerability to coercion and \ninfluence, judgment and trust concerns are implicit in cases involving delinquent debts. \nHistorically, the timing of addressing and resolving debt delinquencies are critical \nto an assessment of an applicant\u2019s trustworthiness, reliability, and good judgment in \nfollowing rules and guidelines necessary for those seeking access to classified \ninformation or to holding a sensitive position. See ISCR Case No. 14-06808 at 3 (App. \nBd. Nov. 23. 2016); ISCR Case No. 14-01894 at 5 (App. Bd. Aug. 18, 2015).  \nApplicant\u2019s cited income limitations impaired her ability to make her timely \nmonthly payments on her debts and prompted her to seek Chapter 13 bankruptcy help \nin resolving her delinquent accounts, and this failing, to retain a financial counseling firm \nto assist her. Application of mitigating condition MC \u00b6 20(b), \u201cthe conditions that resulted \nin the financial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of \nemployment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency a death, divorce or \nseparation, clear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances,\u201d has partial application to any \nremaining delinquent loan balance covered by SOR \u00b6 1.a. \nTwo major consumer debts associated with Applicant\u2019s SOR accounts (many \nattributable to her providing financial help to her daughter) have been satisfied and \nresolved by Applicant with credited payoffs through reduced amounts (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c-1.d) \nFor these resolved accounts, application of MC \u00b6\u00b6 20(c), \u201cthe individual has received or \nis receiving financial counseling for the problem from a legitimate and credible source, \nsuch as a non-profit credit counseling service, and there are clear indications that the \nproblem is being resolved or is under control\u201d and 20(d), \u201cthe individual initiated and is \nadhering to a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts\u201d \nare partially applicable to Applicant\u2019s financial situation. \nIn addressing her remaining debt delinquencies, Applicant has been less \nsuccessful. Afforded opportunities to document her claimed payoffs of her remaining \naccounts (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b and 1.e through 1.i), she has been unable to provide any \nsupporting documentation (even with afforded post-hearing opportunities) to verify her \nhearing claims that she has taken care of these debts. Because most of her \naccumulated debts are aged, their omission from Applicant\u2019s most recent credit reports \nmay quite possibly be the result of either the expiration of statutes of limitation in her \nstate or the reporting policies of credit reporting agencies when covering debts over six \nyears\u2019 delinquent.

He has \nresided in the U.S. since August 2013. While he was deployed, he provided his spouse \nwith a \u201cpower of attorney\u201d so that she could file their income tax returns in his absence, \nbut she was uncomfortable with it. Applicant failed to file tax returns for tax year (TY) \n2012, presumably while he was deployed, but also for TY 2013 \u2013 2015.

It\u2019s just part of the due diligence and one of my responsibilities.\u201d \nIn October 2019, Applicant hired an attorney to interact with the Internal Revenue \nService (IRS) regarding his taxes. The IRS agreed to waive penalties for taxes owed for \ntax year (TY) 2012, but no repayment agreement was made with the IRS to resolve \nApplicant\u2019s tax debts. Applicant eventually filed his FY 2013, 2014, and 2015 tax returns \nin December 2019, along with partial payments. In March 2020, he completed payments \nfor taxes owed for TY 2014; and in May and October 2020, he made two $500 payments \ntoward his TY 2015 debt. In November 2020, he received an IRS notice of intent to seize \n(levy) his property unless he paid $2,283 toward his TY 2015 debt. In August 2021, he \npaid the IRS $2,333 toward his TY 2015 debt. \nApplicant testified at the hearing that he had savings accounts containing about \n$6,300; checking accounts containing about $2,200; equity in a home and IRA/401k \naccounts. His household income was about $140,000 annually. In December 2021, after \nthe hearing in this case, he paid the IRS $19,281 for the TY 2012 debt (substantially more \nthan the $14,000 he claimed he owed); $12,511 for the TY 2013 debt; and $603 for his \nTY 2020 debt. He provided a checking account statement showing a balance of $68,665 \nbefore paying the IRS debts. It is unclear where he obtained the additional cash since his \ntestimony on November 30, 2021. \nThe remaining SOR collection accounts, including a judgment debt in SOR \u00b6 1.c, \nwere settled and paid in 2020. Applicant was unable to locate the creditor for the $88 \nmedical collection account in SOR \u00b6 1.h, however the debt no longer appears on his credit \nreport. \nApplicant provided successful performance evaluations and training and various \nletters of recommendation and support attesting to his honesty, professionalism, \ndedication, loyalty, and trustworthiness. \nPolicies \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 2. \nNational security eligibility is predicated upon the applicant meeting the criteria \ncontained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. \nInstead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge applies \nthese guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person.

An \nadministrative judge must consider a person\u2019s stability, trustworthiness, reliability, \ndiscretion, character, honesty, and judgment. AG \u00b6 1(b). \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \n\u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \u201cSubstantial \nevidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. Washington \nMetro.

The guidelines presume a \nnexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria listed \ntherein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 12-01295 at 3 \n(App. Bd.

ISCR Case No. 14-01894 at 5 \n(App. Bd. Aug. 18, 2015). \nApplicant\u2019s failure to pay 2013 and 2020 taxes when due was not alleged in the \nSOR and may not be an independent basis for denying his application for a security \nclearance. However, conduct not alleged in the SOR may be considered to decide \nwhether a particular adjudicative guideline is applicable, to evaluate evidence of \nextenuation, mitigation, or changed circumstances, or as part of a whole-person analysis. \nISCR Case No. 03-20327 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, 2006). I have considered Applicant\u2019s \nfailure to timely pay his 2013 and 2020 taxes for these limited purposes. \nApplicant\u2019s financial problems have been longstanding and remain a concern. I \ngive mitigating credit for resolution of his collection accounts. However, his federal income \ntax obligations have not been sufficiently mitigated given the number of years of non\u00ad\ncompliance and disregard. I also have concerns about his overall financial responsibility, \nand willingness to comply with future income tax obligations. Applicant may have come \nto the realization that timely filing and paying Federal income tax obligations is a \nsignificant responsibility, however, it has been late in coming. I am not aware that he has \nsought financial counseling to assist him with understanding his financial obligations and \nbudgeting, besides his use of attorneys and accountants. \nOverall, Applicant\u2019s financial responsibility is questionable, and he has a poor track \nrecord with respect to Federal income tax compliance. He had many years to resolve his \ntax obligations, yet allowed them to remain unresolved until his security clearance was \njeopardized. Even then, he was slow to respond to the red flags raised about his tax \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n_______________________ \ndelinquencies since completing his SCA and during the investigation. Based on his \ntestimony, I am not convinced he fully grasps the reality of his tax obligations or has a \nsufficient handle on his personal finances. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder AG \u00b6\u00b6 2(a), 2(c), and 2(d), the ultimate determination of whether to grant \nnational security eligibility must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. Under the whole-person \nconcept, the administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security \nclearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process \nfactors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d). \nI considered all of the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my findings of fact \nand comments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. I also considered \nApplicant\u2019s employment history, periods of unemployment, military and civilian service, \nand family responsibilities. I remain unconvinced of his overall financial responsibility, and \nhis ability, intent, and desire to meet his financial obligations in the future, especially in \ntax compliance. \nAccordingly, I conclude Applicant has not carried his burden of showing that it is \nclearly consistent with the national security interest of the United States to grant him \neligibility for access to classified information. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nAgainst Applicant \nFor Applicant \n Subparagraphs 1.a-1.b:  \n  Subparagraphs 1.c-1.h: \nConclusion \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national security interest of the \nUnited States to grant Applicant eligibility for access to classified information.

He retained an attorney, who requested \na postponement until October 2021. On August 2, 2021, Applicant terminated his \nagreement with his attorney because he could not afford her fee. I gave him until \nSeptember 6, 2021, to find another attorney. He decided to proceed pro se. \nOn October 5, 2021, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) notified \nApplicant that the hearing was scheduled for October 27, 2021. I convened the hearing \nas scheduled. Government Exhibits (GX) 1 through 5 were admitted in evidence without \nobjection.

He served on active duty in the U.S. Air Force from January 1989 to \nJanuary 1993. He worked for various defense contractors from March 2001 to October \n2016. He was unemployed from October 2016 to July 2017, self-employed with low \nincome from October 2017 to June 2018, and unemployed from June to September 2018. \n(GX 1 at 14-23; GX 2 at 9-11.) He has held a security clearance since February 1983. He \nearned an associate\u2019s degree in September 1998 and a bachelor\u2019s degree in December \n2002. He was married from February 1992 to February 2011. He and his wife were \nseparated for a year before they divorced. (Tr. 29.) He has two adult daughters and an \nadult stepson. (Tr. 28.) \nThe SOR alleges failures to timely file federal and state income tax returns, \ndelinquent federal tax debts, a delinquent state tax debt, multiple consumer debts, and \ntwo delinquent medical bills. Applicant\u2019s tax problems are established by his admissions \nand tax transcripts. The debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.h-1.p are reflected in credit reports \nfrom October 2018 (GX 3), October 2019 (GX 4), and July 2021 (GX 5).

After Applicant and his ex-wife separated in February 2010, \nshe claimed the tax exemptions for all three children.

(GX 2 at 19, 21; Tr. 34-35.) At the time, his \nannual gross income was between $70,000 and $75,000, and he was paying child \nsupport of $750 per month and maintaining two households. (Tr. 32-34.) He applied for \nan extension of time to file his federal return, which was granted, but he did not file the \nreturn because he could not afford to pay the taxes due for 2010. He did not timely file \nhis 2011 return because he had not yet filed the 2010 return. \nIn 2011, Applicant increased his income to about $120,000 by holding two full-time \njobs. The IRS placed a lien on his bank account in 2012. In order to have the lien released, \nhe withdrew funds from his retirement account to pay the taxes, without realizing the \nadverse tax consequences of early withdrawals. (Tr. 36-37.) He did not file his 2013 and \n2014 returns because he had amassed a large tax debt and did not know how to proceed. \n(GX 2 at 12.) \nIn the fall of 2015, Applicant hired a professional tax preparer to help him file his \nfederal and state income tax returns for 2011 through 2015. (GX 2 at 12.) He submitted \nIRS account transcripts showing that his 2011 return was filed in January 2016; and his \n2014, 2015, and 2016 returns were filed in February 2016. (GX 2 at 23-31.) In his post-\nhearing submission, he submitted IRS account transcripts showing that the 2012 return \nwas filed in June 2013; his 2019 return was received in June 2020; and his 2020 return \nwas filed in May 2021. (AX G; AX K, AX L.) He submitted IRS wage and income \ntranscripts for 2016 and 2017, and 2018, which do not reflect when the returns were filed. \n(AX H; AX I.) However, the fact that the IRS agreed to a payment plan indicates that all \npast-due returns have been filed. He did not submit any state tax transcripts or other proof \nthat the past-due state returns had been filed. \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c, 1.d, 1.e, and 1.f: federal tax debts of $6,517 for tax year 2011; \n$21,033 for tax year 2013; $2,903 for tax year 2014; and $15,850 for tax year 2015. \nIn response to CAF interrogatories in January 2020, Applicant admitted the tax debts for \nthe years alleged in the SOR, and he provided IRS tax transcripts reflecting the amounts \nalleged. He made an installment agreement in March 2016, which ended in March 2017. \nHe made another installment agreement in April 2017, which ended in September 2018 \nafter two payments were dishonored. (GX 2 at 19, 23-31.) \nIn June 2021, Applicant made an installment agreement for the taxes due for 2013, \n2015, and 2017, providing for payments of $200 per month. He admitted at the hearing \nthat having a payment agreement in place before the hearing was primarily motivated by \nthe realization that his security clearance was in jeopardy. (Tr. 66.) He made the required \npayments from July 28, 2021, through October 28, 2021. (AX G.) The payments will \nincrease to $752 per month in July 2023. (AX A.) He currently earns about $65,000 per \nyear.

Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 2. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge \napplies these guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \n\u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 15-01253 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2016).  \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, \n5 \n\n \nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government.

An individual who is financially \noverextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or otherwise \nquestionable acts to generate funds. . . . \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified information to raise money. It encompasses concerns about a \nperson\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting classified \ninformation. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information. See ISCR \nCase No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \n \nThe debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.j and 1.p are duplicates. When the same conduct \nis alleged twice in the SOR under the same guideline, one of the duplicative allegations \nshould be resolved in an applicant\u2019s favor. See ISCR Case No. 03-04704 at 3 (App. Bd. \nSep. 21, 2005) (same debt alleged twice). Accordingly, I have resolved SOR \u00b6 1.p in \nApplicant\u2019s favor. \n \nApplicant\u2019s admissions and the evidence submitted at the hearing establish the \nfollowing disqualifying conditions under this guideline: \nAG \u00b6 19(a): inability to satisfy debts; \nAG \u00b6 19(c): a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \nAG \u00b6 19(f): failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local \nincome tax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax as required. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe following mitigating conditions are potentially applicable: \nAG \u00b6 20(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not \ncast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \nAG \u00b6 20(b): the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \nAG \u00b6 20(c): the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling \nfor the problem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit \ncredit counseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem \nis being resolved or is under control; \nAG \u00b6 20(d): the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to \nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; \nAG \u00b6 20(e): the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy \nof the past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue; and \nAG \u00b6 20(g): the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax \nauthority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \nAG \u00b6 20(a) is not established. Applicant\u2019s failures to file his tax returns and failures \nto resolve his delinquent debts are numerous, ongoing, and did not arise under \ncircumstances making recurrence unlikely. \n7 \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(b) is not fully established. Applicant\u2019s periods of unemployment, periods \nof underemployment, and his marital breakup were conditions beyond his control. \nHowever, those conditions did not prevent Applicant from timely filing his federal and state \nincome tax returns for several years. Furthermore, he has not acted responsibly. He did \nnot seek professional help with his taxes until 2015, and he did not begin filing his past-\ndue federal returns until January 2016. He did not begin paying his past-due federal taxes \nuntil March 2016. He made no federal tax payments between September 2018 and June \n2021. He did not begin to pay his delinquent state income taxes until September 2021. \nHe submitted no evidence that he had resolved or was resolving the debts alleged in SOR \n\u00b6\u00b6 1.h and 1.k-1.o. \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(c) is partially established for the delinquent federal tax returns and the tax \ndebt. Applicant consulted with a tax professional, has filed his past-due federal tax \nreturns, and has begun to make payments on the federal tax debt. However, insufficient \ntime has passed to establish a track record of compliance with his federal and state tax \ninstallment plans and to establish \u201cclear indications\u201d that his financial situation is under \ncontrol. To the contrary, Applicant acknowledged at the hearing that he is relying on offer \nin compromise to avoid the drastic increase in payments under the July 2021 installment \nagreement. \nAG \u00b6 20(d) is not established. Applicant admitted that most recent installment \nagreement with the IRS was motivated primarily by the imminent hearing and the \nknowledge that his security clearance was in jeopardy. Payment of debts only under \npressure of qualifying for a security clearance does not constitute \u201cgood faith.\u201d Applicants \nwho begin to address their security-significant conduct only when their personal interests \nare at stake may be lacking in judgment and reliability. ISCR Case No. 16-01211 (App. \nBd. May 30, 2018). \nApplicant has taken no action to resolve the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.h, 1.k, 1.l, \n1.m, and 1.o. He claimed that he had paid the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.m and 1.n, but \nhe submitted no documentary proof of any payments. When an applicant claims that a \ndebt has been paid, it is reasonable to expect the applicant to present documentary \nevidence showing resolution of specific debts. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 15-03363 at 2 \n(App. Bd. Oct. 19, 2016). \nApplicant presented evidence that he had a payment agreement for the debt \nalleged in SOR \u00b6 1.i, but he submitted no evidence of any payments under that \nagreement. His evidence amounts to a promise to pay the debt, but a promise to pay or \notherwise resolve a delinquent debt in the future is not a substitute for a track record of \npayments or other financially responsible actions. ISCR Case No. 17-04110 (App. Bd. \nSep. 26, 2019). \nAG \u00b6 20(g) is established. Applicant has filed his past-due federal returns and has \ninitiated and complied with payment plans for his delinquent taxes. However, Applicant\u2019s \neventual compliance with his tax obligations does not end the inquiry. A security \nclearance adjudication is not a tax-enforcement procedure. It is an evaluation of an \nindividual\u2019s judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. \nFailure to file tax returns suggests that an applicant has a problem with complying \nwith well-established governmental rules and systems. Voluntary compliance with such \nrules and systems is essential for protecting classified information. ISCR Case No. 01-\n05340 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 20, 2002). A security clearance adjudication is not a vehicle \naimed at insuring an applicant\u2019s compliance with the tax laws. The fact that Applicant has \nfiled his past-due returns does not preclude careful consideration of his security \nworthiness based on longstanding prior irresponsibility. ISCR Case No. 12-05053 (App. \nBd. Oct.30, 2014).

In applying the whole-\nperson concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process \nfactors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \nI have incorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis \nand applied the adjudicative factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). I have considered Applicant\u2019s military \nservice and long history of working for defense contractors while holding a security \nclearance, but they are insufficient to mitigate his irresponsible financial behavior. After \nweighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under Guideline F, and evaluating all \nthe evidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has not mitigated \nthe security concerns raised by repeated failures to timely his federal and state tax income \ntax returns and his delinquent debts. \nFormal Findings \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F (Financial Considerations): AGAINST A\n PPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a, 1.j, and 1.p:  \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.b-1.i and 1.k-1.o: \nAgainst Applicant \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nConclusion \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national security interests of the \nUnited States to grant Applicant eligibility for access to classified information.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant admitted the child support debt at SOR 1.b; although he asserted that the debt was now about $3,000. He denied the remaining allegations, claiming that some of the debts were duplicates, some had been paid, and some had been paid down. Applicant is a 41-year-old air battle management subject matter expert employed by a U.S. defense contractor since July 2018. He served honorably in the U.S. military from about March 1998 to about March 2018, when he retired. He held a clearance early in his military career, but was denied a clearance in August 2009 for financial issues. He has not previously held an industrial clearance (Item 3). From September 1998 to July 2016, Applicant fathered six children with four different women in four different states. He does not have eight children as stated in the FORM. Nor did he omit two children from his clearance application (Item 3) as stated in his May 2019 interview with a Government investigator (Item 7). The two children listed as missing from the clearance application in Item 7 are clearly listed in Item 3. The given names, dates of birth, and states of birth match exactly.

The record in this case \nclosed 11 March 2021, when Department Counsel stated no objection to Applicant\u2019s \nResponse to the FORM.

He denied the remaining allegations, claiming that some \nof the debts were duplicates, some had been paid, and some had been paid down. \nApplicant is a 41-year-old air battle management subject matter expert employed \nby a U.S. defense contractor since July 2018. He served honorably in the U.S. military \nfrom about March 1998 to about March 2018, when he retired. He held a clearance early \nin his military career, but was denied a clearance in August 2009 for financial issues. He \nhas not previously held an industrial clearance (Item 3). \nFrom September 1998 to July 2016, Applicant fathered six children with four \ndifferent women in four different states. He does not have eight children as stated in the \nFORM. Nor did he omit two children from his clearance application (Item 3) as stated in \nhis May 2019 interview with a Government investigator (Item 7). The two children listed \nas missing from the clearance application in Item 7 are clearly listed in Item 3. The given \nnames, dates of birth, and states of birth match exactly. \nApplicant was born in early September 1979. He graduated from a hometown high \nschool in May 1997. He enlisted in the U.S. military in about March 1998. His first child, \na son, was born 01 September 1998, in Applicant\u2019s hometown. The record is unclear \nwhether Applicant was aware of this pregnancy and birth at the time, or at what point the \nmother began pursuing child support, but at the time of Applicant\u2019s 12 September 2018 \ncredit report (Item 6)\u2014two years after his son turned 18 years old\u2014his child support \narrears to this state was the nearly $13,000 alleged at SOR 1.e. This allegation appears \nto be a duplicate of SOR debt 1.d, based on the delinquent amount reported in Applicant\u2019s \n30 July 2019 credit report (Item 5). Applicant denied SOR debt 1.e based on the fact that \nhis 27 January 2020 credit report (Answer) showed that his 27 December 2019 balance \nhad been reduced to $3,489. Applicant\u2019s 13 December 2020 credit report (Item 4) showed \nthe account as \u201cpaid collection\u201d in November 2020. Applicant\u2019s Response to the FORM \nshows a last payment to the state on 8 December 2020, a termination of a withholding \norder for support from Applicant\u2019s military retirement of uncertain date, and a 25 January \n2021 credit reporting a zero balance on this account as of 27 November 2020. \nApplicant\u2019s second child, a daughter, was born 2 February 2000, in the state that \nappears to have been Applicant\u2019s first non-training, active duty station. Again, the record \nis unclear whether Applicant was aware of this pregnancy and birth at the time, or at what \npoint the mother began pursuing child support, but at the time of Applicant\u2019s 12 \nSeptember 1998 credit report (Item 6)\u2014seven months after his daughter turned 18 years \nold\u2014his child support arrears to this state was slightly more than the $5,436 alleged at \nSOR 1.b. The alleged amount is the amount from Applicant\u2019s 30 July 2019 credit report \n(Item 5). However, Applicant\u2019s 13 December 2020 credit report (Item 4), shows a \ncollection amount of $4, based on a last payment date of September 2020. However, at \nthe time the creditor was not able to locate the Applicant. Applicant noted that this account \ndid not appear on his 27 January 2020 credit report (Answer), but that is because the \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ncreditor did not report this account to the credit bureau Applicant used at the time. He \nlater admitted owing $3,000. However, his 25 January 2021 credit report (Response) \nshows the account (opened in March 2000) closed as of 31 December 2020 with the \nsame $4 delinquent balance listed in Item 4. The record is unclear whether Applicant was \npaying voluntarily or having his wages garnished. \nApplicant had three children with his wife, whom he married 6 March 2000. She \nwas pregnant when they married, and Applicant\u2019s third child, a second daughter was born \non 18 April 2000, in the same state as his out-of-wedlock daughter. Applicant\u2019s fourth \nchild, a second son, was born 22 July 2002, and his fifth child, a third daughter, was born \n3 May 2006, both near Applicant\u2019s next duty station in another state. \nTwo duty stations later, Applicant and his wife divorced on 23 May 2011, and it \nappears his ex-wife and the three children moved to her hometown. That may explain the \ndelinquent child support in the state where they divorced (SOR 1.c) and the state where \nshe moved (SOR 1.f). SOR debt 1.c alleges $5,254 child support, of which $4,718 is \ndelinquent as of July 2019 (Item 5). SOR debt 1.f alleges $11,971 child support, all of it \ndelinquent as of October 2015 (Item 6). However, Applicant\u2019s 30 December 2020 credit \nreport (Item 4) shows that the account was \u201cpaid as agreed\u201d before being transferred/sold \nin October 2015. Nevertheless, it seems Applicant\u2019s ex-wife may have moved again, \nleading to the child support debts at SOR 1.a and 1.g. \nSOR debts 1.a and 1.g are with the same state, and there seems to have been a \nthird account with that state, documented by Applicant\u2019s 27 January 2020 credit report \n(Answer), which shows an account seriously past due for $502. However, this account \ndoes not appear on any of the credit reports obtained by the Government. SOR debt 1.a \nappears on all three Government-obtained credit reports (Items 4-6), alleged in the \namount appearing on both the 13 December 2020 (Item 4) and 30 July 2019 (Item 5) \ncredit reports, and with an account number distinct from both Applicant\u2019s 27 January 2020 \ncredit report and the account number for SOR debt 1.f, which appears on Applicant\u2019s 12 \nSeptember 2018 credit report (Item 6) in the SOR-alleged past due amount. \nFinally, in July 2016, Applicant had his sixth child, another daughter, with another \nwoman, in the state where he was last stationed. Beyond listing his wife and children as \nrequired on his clearance application, Applicant has explained very little about the \ncircumstances attending the births of his children. His 2 May 2019 subject interview (Item \n7) suggests that paternity tests established his parenthood in any case where it might \nhave been at issue, but he has not explained the timing of any of these events other than \nthe actual births. \nThe SOR alleges, and Items 3-7 document, 11 delinquent debts totaling nearly \n$59,000. Applicant admits one debt, asserting that it is significantly lower than the amount \nalleged in the SOR. The debts consist of over $56,000 in delinquent child support \npayments to five states, and four delinquent commercial accounts totaling almost $2500, \nthat Applicant claims to have paid. \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant disclosed SOR debts 1.e, 1.g, 1.h, 1.i, and 1.k on his 3 August 2018 \nclearance application (Item 3). He discussed and confirmed these debts during his 2 May \n2019 interview with a Government investigator (Item 7), but also agreed to the other SOR \ndebts reported on Applicant\u2019s 12 September 2018 credit report (Item 6), including the \nchild support debts at SOR 1.a, 1.b, and 1.f. At the time, he said he did not recognize \nSOR debt 1.j because he thought he only had one account with that creditor. He claimed \nto have paid SOR debts 1.h-1.k, but provided no documentation. However, Applicant\u2019s \n13 December 2020 credit report (Item 6) shows SOR debt 1.i paid in May 2019. \nAside from more recent credit reports from the credit bureau which originally \nreported the fewest of the SOR debts, an undated termination of income withholding \nsupport order from the state listed in SOR debts 1.d-1.e from his military retirement, and \nan 8 December 2020 payment receipt from the same state. Applicant documented no \nefforts to contact any of his creditors or to provide a current status of his debts. He \ndocumented no credit or financial counseling, and did not submit a budget. He provided \nno work or character references, or evidence of community involvement. It appears that \nexcept for his two youngest daughters, born in 2006 and 2016, respectively, his ongoing \nchild support obligations have expired, except for any arrears still due. \nPolicies \nThe adjudicative guidelines (AG) list factors for evaluating a person\u2019s suitability for \naccess to classified information. Administrative judges must assess disqualifying and \nmitigating conditions under each issue fairly raised by the facts and situation presented. \nEach decision must also reflect a fair, impartial, and commonsense consideration of the \nfactors listed in AG \u00a7 2(a). Any one disqualifying or mitigating condition is not, by itself, \nconclusive. However, specific adjudicative guidelines should be followed where a case \ncan be measured against them, as they represent policy guidance governing access to \nclassified information. Considering the SOR allegations and the evidence as a whole, the \nrelevant adjudicative guideline is Guideline F (Financial Considerations). \nSecurity clearance decisions resolve whether it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant or continue an applicant\u2019s security clearance. The Government \nmust prove, by substantial evidence, controverted facts alleged in the SOR. If it does, the \nburden shifts to applicant to refute, extenuate, or mitigate the Government\u2019s case. \nBecause no one has a right to a security clearance, the applicant bears a heavy burden \nof persuasion. \nPersons with access to classified information enter into a fiduciary relationship with \nthe Government based on trust and confidence. Therefore, the Government has a \ncompelling interest in ensuring each applicant possesses the requisite judgement, \nreliability, and trustworthiness of those who must protect national interests as their own. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe \u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d standard compels resolution of any \nreasonable doubt about an applicant\u2019s suitability for access in favor of the Government.2 \nAnalysis \nThe Government established a case for disqualification under Guideline F, and \nApplicant failed to mitigate the security concerns. He experienced financial pressures \nbeginning in 1998, accumulated significant delinquent debt during his military service due \nto his child support obligations exceeding what the military could legally withhold from his \npay and allowances, and the ensuing indebtedness cannot be said to have been largely \ndue to circumstances beyond his control. Moreover, while he appears to have made \nsubstantial progress on his child support arrears after augmenting his military retirement \nwith his current job, it appears that that progress has been accomplished through ongoing \ngarnishment of his wages. Furthermore, he did not corroborate his claimed payments on \nhis consumer credit accounts; nor did he provide evidence of his actual child support \nobligations in the several states which reported them to the credit bureaus.3 Applicant \nappears to have had a 20-year career in the military, the last half of which was under such \nfinancial strain that the military denied him a clearance. The macro view of his finances \nfrom his credit reports is sufficient to establish the security concerns raised by the \nGovernment, but insufficient to supply the mitigation; Applicant failed to provide the micro \nview of his finances necessary to conclude that these security concerns have been \nmitigated. Even the child support obligations that appear to have been resolved have \nbeen finally resolved only after Applicant received the SOR. \nApplicant meets none of the mitigating conditions for financial considerations. His \nindebtedness is multiple, recent, and ongoing.4 Moreover, Applicant cannot demonstrate \nthat his indebtedness was largely due to circumstances beyond his control, and he has \nnot demonstrated that he has been responsible in addressing his debts.5 The lack of any \ndetail regarding his dealings with the state agencies responsible for child support \nobligations precludes a finding that his dealings have been responsible. \nApplicant has not had any credit or financial counseling, and he has not \ndocumented that the debts are being resolved.6 The absence of documentation means \n2See, Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518 (1988). \n3\u00a79(a) inability to satisfy debts; (b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so;(c) a \nhistory of not meeting financial obligations; \n4\u00a720(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such circumstances that \nit is unlikely to recur . . . \n5\u00a720(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person=s control . . . \nand the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n6\u00a720(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and there are clear indications \nthat the problem is being resolved or is under control; \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                            \n \n \n                                                 \n \n \n \nApplicant cannot demonstrate that he has made a good-faith effort to resolve his debts.7  \nMoreover, he submitted no work or character evidence which might support a whole-\nperson assessment to overcome the security concerns raised by his conduct.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact In his answer, Applicant admitted all the SOR allegations (\u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.h and 2.a). His admissions are incorporated into my findings of fact. Based on my review of the pleadings, evidence submitted, and testimony, I make the following additional findings of fact: Applicant is 37 years old. He was married in 2021. He has a minor son and step\u00ad son with his wife and an adult daughter from a prior relationship. He has taken college courses, but has not earned a degree. He has worked as a material handler for a defense contractor since 2009. He stated that he previously held a security clearance, but it is no longer active. (Tr. 18-20; GE 1) Applicant cited different reasons for his financial problems and the debts in the SOR. He reported that a few years after his daughter was born, he was required to pay monthly child support and part of her daycare expenses, which impacted his finances. He 2 paid child support between about 2004 and 2020, and claimed that in 2014 it increased to about $1,000 monthly for the last five years. (Tr. 29-32, 68-69) Applicant reported that for a time he was living beyond his means, had maxed out his credit cards, and was getting behind on his bills. In the 2013-2014 timeframe, he was suspended from work without pay on a few occasions, for mistakes he made at work. In about October 2020, his girlfriend (now his wife) lost her job, and he was the sole income earner in their household for about a year, until 2021. (Tr. 22, 61-62) Under Guide",

The record closed on August 1, 2011. \nDOHA received the hearing transcript (Tr.) on July 21, 2022. \nAmendment to the SOR  \nAt the hearing, one of Applicant\u2019s exhibits (AE B) was his IRS account balance. \nThis exhibit shows that Applicant has an unpaid IRS tax debt of $22,926 for tax years \n2014, 2015, and 2021 combined. Department Counsel had not seen this information prior \nto the hearing, and moved to amend the SOR, pursuant to DoD Directive 5220.6 E3.1.17 \nof the Additional Procedure Guidance of the Directive, and add the following allegation: \n\u00b6 1.i. You are indebted to the federal government in the approximate \namount of $22,926 for unpaid taxes for tax years 2014, 2015, and 2021. \nApplicant objected to the motion because he said that he was just trying to be \nhonest. His objection was overruled because the basis for the amendment was a \ndocument that he provided. The motion to amend the SOR was granted. Applicant \nadmitted new allegation \u00b6 1.i. I left the record open until August 1, 2022, to provide \nApplicant an opportunity to respond to the amended allegations and to submit \ndocumentary evidence. See ISCR 02-23365 at 5 (App. Bd. Mar. 22, 2004) (\u201c[A]s long as \nthere is fair notice to an applicant about the matters that are at issue in his case, and the \napplicant has a reasonable opportunity to respond, a security clearance case should be \nadjudicated on the merits of the relevant issues and should not be overly concerned with \npleading niceties.\u201d); See also ISCR Case No. 05-05334 at 4 (App. Bd. Jan. 10, 2007) \n(\u201cThe government and the Judge are free to amend the SOR at any time, but must permit \nApplicant time and an opportunity to respond to the adverse reason upon which any \nadverse decision is based.\u201d). In his post-hearing submission, Applicant did not provide \nany further information about this tax debt. (Tr. 24-29, 42-44, 64-67; AE B) \nFindings of Fact \nIn his answer, Applicant admitted all the SOR allegations (\u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.h and 2.a). His \nadmissions are incorporated into my findings of fact. Based on my review of the pleadings, \nevidence submitted, and testimony, I make the following additional findings of fact: \nApplicant is 37 years old. He was married in 2021. He has a minor son and step\u00ad\nson with his wife and an adult daughter from a prior relationship. He has taken college \ncourses, but has not earned a degree. He has worked as a material handler for a defense \ncontractor since 2009. He stated that he previously held a security clearance, but it is no \nlonger active. (Tr. 18-20; GE 1) \nApplicant cited different reasons for his financial problems and the debts in the \nSOR. He reported that a few years after his daughter was born, he was required to pay \nmonthly child support and part of her daycare expenses, which impacted his finances.

(Tr. 29-32, 68-69) \nApplicant reported that for a time he was living beyond his means, had maxed out \nhis credit cards, and was getting behind on his bills. In the 2013-2014 timeframe, he was \nsuspended from work without pay on a few occasions, for mistakes he made at work. In \nabout October 2020, his girlfriend (now his wife) lost her job, and he was the sole income \nearner in their household for about a year, until 2021. (Tr. 22, 61-62) \nUnder Guideline F, the original SOR alleges eight delinquent debts, including five \nstudent loans totaling about $15,856, and three delinquent consumer debts totaling about \n$4,981. Under Guideline E, the SOR also alleges that Applicant falsified material facts on \nhis 2018 SCA. The status of the allegations is as follows: \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.c, 1.d, and 1.g are student loans in collection totaling $13,308, and \n\u00b6 1.e is a student loan that has been charged off for $2,548. Applicant attended college \nclasses from about 2010-2013. He stated that after finishing his courses, he was unable \nto afford the loan payments. He reported that he has never made any payments on these \nloans. He claimed that he requested a payment plan a couple of times, but never followed \nthrough with payments. These student loans are unresolved. In a post hearing \nsubmission, he provided payoff and settlement information for a debt with a student loan \ncreditor that was not alleged in the SOR. He did not provide evidence showing that he \nhas made payments to resolve this other student loan. (Tr. 20-22, 35-38, 41, 63-64; GE \n2, 4, 5) \nSOR \u00b6 1.b is an auto loan placed for collection for $4,527. Applicant stated that \nthe vehicle was totaled in an accident in 2020. After the accident, he never reached out \nto the insurance company or the lender to resolve this debt. This debt remains unpaid. \n(Tr. 20-21, 38-40, 67-68; GE 4, 5). \nSOR \u00b6 1.f is a credit card placed for collection for $302. It has been delinquent \nsince about 2013. Applicant stated that he has no recollection if it was ever paid, and he \nfailed to provide any documentation showing that it has been resolved. (Tr. 22, 40-41; GE \n4, 5) \nSOR \u00b6 1.h is a gym membership account placed for collection for $152. Applicant \nstated that he was unable to handle the expense after joining. He stated that he last \nreached out to the creditor in 2017, and has not taken any action since then. This debt is \nremains unpaid. (Tr. 22, 41-42; GE 5) \nSOR \u00b6 1.i is an unpaid federal income tax debt for $22,926 for tax years 2014, \n2015, and 2021. The debt is split almost evenly for each tax year. Applicant stated that \nhe was traveling to another state for work for a few weeks in 2015 and 2016 when his \n2014 and 2015 tax returns needed to be filed. He reported that he was living with his \nmother at the time, and that she was supposed to file the returns for him while he was on \ntravel. She did not file the returns, and he did not confirm the filings with her. He stated \nthat he learned that these two tax returns had not been filed and that he owed money for \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \nthese years in 2016 or 2017.

(Tr. 24-29, 42-44, 64-67; AE B) \nSOR \u00b6 2.a alleges that Applicant falsified material facts on his 2018 SCA by failing \nto report his financial delinquencies involving routine accounts. His narrative in his SOR \nanswer and testimony were the same. He said that his failure to report the debts was not \nintentional, because he was rushing to complete his SCA. He claimed that since he works \nin the tool room, he was repeatedly interrupted while completing his SCA. He also \nasserted that he read the questions too fast and answered the questions without \nunderstanding them. He reported some of his delinquent debts in his background \ninterview with a government investigator before being confronted with his other debts. (Tr. \n11-12, 23, 56-68; GE 1, 2) \nApplicant reported that he earns about $43 an hour, which has increased from \nabout $20 an hour when he started in 2009. He and his wife purchased a home in about \n2019, and their monthly mortgage is about $2,000. They do not have a written budget, \nand he failed to provide any other information about their monthly income and expenses. \nHe reported that they do not have any funds in their joint savings account, but that he has \nabout $80,000 in his 401K retirement account. He has not had credit counseling. His wife \nhandles their finances, and has recently started a credit repair business. He reported that \nshe has personal debt that she is trying to address as well. (Tr. 45-49, 62) \nPolicies \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG), which became \neffective on June 8, 2017. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in conjunction \nwith the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.  \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation of potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds.  \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts;  \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income tax \nreturns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as required. \nThe SOR allegations are established by the credit reports, IRS account balance \nrecord, and Applicant\u2019s admissions. AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a), 19(c), and 19(f) apply. \nConditions that could mitigate the financial considerations security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 20. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; and \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority \nto file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \nAG \u00b6 20(a) does not apply. Applicant failed to provide sufficient documentation \nshowing that any of alleged debts are resolved, or that any became delinquent under \nsuch circumstances that are unlikely to recur. He failed to provide sufficient \ndocumentation of his current financial situation, evidence which might establish his ability \nto address his debts responsibly. His failure to pay his delinquent debt, charged-off debt, \nand his past-due tax debt is recent, ongoing, and not isolated. This continues to cast \ndoubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. \nAG \u00b6 20(b) partially applies because in 2020, Applicant\u2019s wife lost her job, and he \nwas the sole earner in their household for about a year. However, all of the alleged debt \nbecame delinquent prior to her job loss, except for his tax debt for 2021. Applicant did not \nprovide sufficient evidence showing that his debts occurred largely due to circumstances \nbeyond his control or that he acted responsibly under the circumstances. AG \u00b6 20(b) does \nnot fully apply. \nAG \u00b6 20(g) does not apply. Applicant has significant unresolved federal income tax \ndebt as well as two years of unfiled federal income tax returns. He has known about his \ntax issues for several years, and he has not made any payment arrangements with the \nIRS. \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \nAG \u00b6 15 details the personal conduct security concern: \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes\u2026 \nI have considered the disqualifying conditions for drug involvement under AG \u00b6 16 \nand the following are potentially applicable \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar \nform used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, \naward benefits or status, determine national security eligibility or \ntrustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities; and \nSOR \u00b6 2.a alleges that Applicant falsified his 2018 SCA by failing to report his \nfinancial delinquencies involving routine accounts. Applicant testified that this failure was \na mistake, and not intentional. I found his explanation credible. The record also shows \nthat he reported delinquent debt and tax debt in his background investigation before being \nconfronted. The Government did not provide sufficient evidence showing that this was a \ndeliberate omission, concealment, or falsification. \u00b6 2.a is not established, and is found \nfor Applicant. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the potentially \ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and circumstances \nsurrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-\nperson analysis. \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance. While personal conduct security concerns \nunder Guideline E are resolved, Applicant did not provide sufficient evidence to mitigate \nthe security concerns arising out of Applicant\u2019s delinquent taxes and other debts under \nGuideline F. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.i: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 2.a: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIt is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant a security \nclearance.

Sykstus, Esq. \n04/18/2022 \nDecision \nHEINTZELMAN, Caroline E., Administrative Judge: \nApplicant mitigated security concerns raised by her psychological condition and \npast alcohol consumption. Based upon a review of the record as a whole, national security \neligibility for access to classified information is granted. \nHistory of the Case \nApplicant submitted a security clearance application (SCA) on May 11, 2016. On \nNovember 1, 2019, the Department of Defense (DOD) Consolidated Adjudication Facility \n(CAF) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) alleging security concerns under Guideline \nI (psychological conditions) and Guideline G (alcohol consumption). Applicant answered \nthe SOR on November 22, 2019, and requested a hearing before an administrative judge. \nI was assigned to the case on June 3, 2020, but the hearing was delayed due to the \nCOVID-19 pandemic. On March 5, 2021, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals \n(DOHA) notified Applicant that the hearing was scheduled for March 30, 2021, and the \nhearing was held as scheduled via video teleconference on the Defense Collaborative \nSystem (DCS). \nGovernment\u2019s Exhibits (GE) 1 through 4 and Applicant\u2019s Exhibits (AE) A through \nN were admitted without objection. I marked my March 4, 2021 prehearing scheduling \norder as Hearing Exhibit (HE I); Department Counsel\u2019s February 14, 2020 discovery letter \n1 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nas HE II; and Department Counsel\u2019s exhibit list as HE III. Applicant and eight character \nwitnesses testified. Department Counsel requested that the record be left open to be \nallowed to submit the DOD CAF\u2019s 2018 psychology report referenced in the SOR. \nApplicant\u2019s counsel did not object, but noted the inherent unfairness caused by the \nGovernment\u2019s failure to include this document in its February 2020 discovery and its \nfailure to produce this document in the intervening year prior to the hearing. \nOn March 30, 2021, after the hearing was completed, I received the DOD CAF\u2019s \npsychology report and labeled it GE 5. On March 31, 2021, Applicant\u2019s counsel objected \nto GE 5 based upon fairness and timeliness. I overruled his objection but reopened the \nrecord and set a follow-up hearing date of May 6, 2021. All parties met again via DCS as \nscheduled. \nAt the May 6, 2021 reconvened hearing, I marked the various emails, collectively, \nregarding GE 5 as HE IV. Applicant\u2019s original AE B was marked as HE V, and an updated \nversion of AE B was admitted into the record without objection. Additionally, AE O, an \nupdated letter from Applicant\u2019s psychiatrist, was admitted without objection, and Applicant \ntestified. Applicant\u2019s counsel renewed his earlier objections to GE 5, and noted that the \n2018 report did not incorporate or review the records contained in GE 3, despite \nApplicant\u2019s timely signing of a records release. Nor did GE 5 specifically state what \nrecords were considered by the DOD CAF psychologist. The DOD CAF report also \nreferenced documents that were not offered into evidence by the Government at the \nhearing and referenced information that was not supported by the documents offered by \nthe Government. I noted Applicant\u2019s counsel\u2019s objections, overruled them, admitted GE \n5, and stated that the objections would go to the weight of the document. \nI received the transcript (Tr.) of the March 30, 2021 hearing on April 16, 2021, and \nI received the transcript (Tr. 2) of the May 6, 2021 reconvened hearing on May 21, 2021, \nand the record closed. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant is almost 44 years old, divorced, and has no children. In December 2001,\nshe received a Bachelor of Science in computer science, with a computer information \nsystem\u2019s option. In May 2006, she received a Master of Science in management \ninformation systems. Applicant has worked for her current employer, a Defense \ncontractor, since April 2016. At the time of the hearing, Applicant was working as an \ninformation systems security officer. Prior to the revocation of her interim secret security \nclearance in November 2019, she supported her company\u2019s classified computer systems. \nThis is her first security clearance application. (GE 1; GE 4; AE C; AE D; Tr. at 12-14, 26-\n28) \n \nThe SOR alleges that Applicant was evaluated in September 2018, by a licensed \nclinical psychologist and was subsequently diagnosed with bipolar I disorder, most recent \nepisode with psychotic features; alcohol use disorder, severe; and unspecified anxiety \ndisorder.

The alcohol use disorder was cross-\nalleged under Guideline G. The SOR also alleged that when Applicant was discharged in \nApril 2015 from an inpatient treatment program for her bipolar I disorder, she received a \nmedical recommendation that she abstain from alcohol, yet she continued to consume \nalcohol. (SOR; GE 5) \nApplicant admitted in her Answer to the SOR that her current diagnosis is bipolar \nI disorder, for which she receives regular treatment. However, she denied the alcohol use \ndisorder, severe diagnosis, and stated that in 2015 she stopped taking the medication \nthat was contraindicated with alcohol use. Additionally, she indicated that she has \nvoluntarily abstained from alcohol since November 2019. (SOR; Answer; AE A; AE B) \nFrom a young age, Applicant suffered from sporadic depression issues, and her \ndrinking, in part, was the result of her depression and undiagnosed mental health\nconditions. She started drinking alcohol in high school at the age of 15 or 16. Her\ndepression worsened while she was in college, and consequently, her alcohol\nconsumption increased after she started college in 1996. (GE 4 at 4; GE 5; Tr. at 29, 44-\n45, 59-60; Tr. 2 at 20)  \n \n \n \nIn 2000, while still in college, Applicant was \u201cvery depressed\u201d and started \u201cdrinking \nheavily.\u201d She consumed alcohol three to four times a week to the point of intoxication. In \nSeptember 2000, she was arrested and charged with driving under the influence of \nalcohol (DUI) after attending a party. Applicant pled guilty and paid the relevant fines. She \nwas not court ordered to receive treatment, nor did she voluntarily seek treatment for her \nalcohol consumption at that time. (GE 4 at 3-4; GE 5; Tr. 37-39, 59-60; Tr. 2 at 20) \nIn July 2001, Applicant was arrested and charged with a second DUI. Following \nthis arrest, she voluntary attended alcohol-related treatment from August to September \n2001. She received inpatient treatment for approximately 10 days and then outpatient \ntreatment for two to three months. According to Applicant, the treatment she received was \nhelpful, but she does not recall what her diagnosis was at that time. (Applicant attempted \nto obtain a copy of these treatment records, but they had been destroyed.) It was \nrecommended that following her treatment, she discontinue consuming alcohol and \ncontinue attending Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) meetings. (AA meetings were part of her \noutpatient treatment.) She voluntarily attended AA meetings for approximately three years \nafter the July 2001 DUI. She found that the AA meetings fell in line with her personal faith, \nand they were very helpful overall in her life. (GE 4 at 4; GE 5; Tr. at 38-42, 61-62; Tr. 2 \nat 21, 23) \nApplicant was unaware of how significant her depression or mental health issues \nwere until approximately 2004, when she was diagnosed with bipolar disorder \n(unspecified) by her then primary care physician. He also treated her older sister, who \nhad previously been diagnosed with bipolar disorder. It was stressed to Applicant that she \ntake her medication regularly; however, after her initial diagnosis, she freely admits that \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nshe was inconsistent with taking her medications for about a year. She later realized that \nshe needed her medication and was mostly compliant for approximately ten years, until \nabout 2014. (Tr. at 29, 40, 43-46, 61) \nIn approximately 2004, when Applicant resumed consuming alcohol, she disclosed \nto her primary care physician that she was drinking again in moderation. He asked her to \nwatch her levels of alcohol consumption, but he never told her not to drink or gave her \ninstructions as to how much she should or should not drink. She testified that she resumed \nconsuming alcohol, because she believed she had dealt with her underlying mental-\nhealth issues and did not consider herself to be an alcoholic, alcohol dependent, nor have \nan alcohol-related condition. She also described her drinking as responsible, due to \nhaving matured. Between 2004, when Applicant resumed consuming alcohol, and 2019, \nwhen she discontinued consuming alcohol, as further discussed below, she had no \nalcohol-related incidents. (GE 4; Tr. at 42-43, 46-47, 62-66; Tr. 2 at 24) \nIn August 2011, Applicant sought treatment from her primary care physician, due \nto a crying spell. (She received treatment from him from 2009 to 2015.) He referred her \nto a local hospital where she received three days of inpatient treatment for a bipolar \nepisode. She could provide no additional details regarding the circumstances of this \nincident. (GE 4; Tr. at 64, 66-68) \nIn April 2015, Applicant noticed her medications were no longer working, as she \nwas hearing voices and having paranoid and suicidal ideations. She went to her parents\u2019 \nhome for support and later contacted her primary care physician. She was ultimately \nreferred to an inpatient facility for five days of treatment. At that time, she was \nexperiencing a manic episode and was diagnosed with bipolar I disorder, recurrent, \nsevere depression with psychotic features, and anxiety disorder, not otherwise specified. \nFollowing this diagnosis and treatment, she felt like her medications were working, but \ndue to the effect the situation had on her, she voluntarily did not drink for approximately \neight months, as she wanted to allow her brain time to rest and heal. (GE 2; GE 4; GE 5; \nTr. at 30-31, 47-51) \nApplicant did not recall if the inpatient facility recommended that she abstain from \nalcohol and drugs. Nor did she read the medication instructions for the prescriptions that \nshe received. According to the records that she provided in her response to \ninterrogatories, at least one of the medications she was prescribed in April 2015, indicated \nthat a person taking the prescription should \u201c[a]void alcoholic drinks.\u201d (More than one of \nthe medications she was prescribed at that time, also indicated that it was recommended, \n\u201cGive your health care provider a list of all the medicines, herbs, non-prescription drugs, \nor dietary supplements you use. Also tell them if you smoke, drink alcohol, or use illegal \ndrugs. Some items may interact with your medicine.) As stated above, for approximately \neight months after her hospitalization, Applicant voluntarily abstained from alcohol. She \ndoes not recall receiving any specific recommendations from her treating physicians to \nabstain from alcohol.

She has received \nconsistent treatment from this facility up until at least the reconvened hearing. \nI did not expect to have a manic episode. But it ended up being a blessing. \n\u2026[O]nce I got to [Facility X], and ultimately ended up following up with them, \nthey just really know what they\u2019re doing. \u2026 [T]hey\u2019re experts in their field \nand it\u2019s been a great thing. And I did follow up with my psychiatrist every \nthree months, I believe. And of course, I can always call and get in sooner \nif I need to. (Tr. at 31-32) \nAt Facility X, Applicant primarily saw Dr. A, a psychiatrist, from April 2015 to February \n2017, when her treating psychiatrist became Dr. B. In Applicant\u2019s medical records, Dr. B \nnoted that in October 2018, Applicant had bipolar II disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, \nand ADHD. She found Applicant\u2019s thought process, at that time, to be logical and \ncoherent. (GE 3) \nApplicant\u2019s medical records from Facility X reflect that she became more compliant \nwith taking her medication the longer she received treatment from this specialized facility. \nAdditionally, her prognosis improved and the frequency of her appointments decreased. \nThroughout the notes in the records, it is apparent that Applicant self-reported periods of \nnon-compliance with various prescribed medications. In her February 2018 appointment, \nApplicant disclosed that she had discontinued taking Zoloft due to its side effects, and \nshe and Dr. B developed a new treatment plan. At various points in her treatment, \nApplicant discussed discontinuing other medications with Dr. B based upon side effects \nshe was experiencing. Her most significant non-compliance with taking medications was \nnoted in February 2017, when she discontinued taking her medications for three weeks, \nbut she self-reported this to Dr. B. At the hearing, Applicant explained that she stopped \ntaking one of her prescriptions, because it would get stuck in her throat. Applicant was \nrequired to undergo a procedure under general anesthesia, as the medication had burned \nher throat. She did not like taking this medication, and at the hearing could only recall \ndiscontinuing this specific medication. (GE 3; Tr. at 45-46; Tr. 2 at 20-21) \nFollowing her 2015 manic episode and bipolar I disorder diagnosis, Applicant \nslowly resumed consuming alcohol again in approximately 2016, while she was receiving \ntreatment at Facility X. She explained that she felt comfortable drinking because she was \nin a good place with her psychotropic medication. Applicant disclosed that she was \nconsuming alcohol to both Dr. A and Dr. B. Applicant\u2019s records reflect that she also \ndisclosed to Dr. B, her prior DUIs and her earlier history of drinking related to her \ndepression. Dr. B did not diagnose Applicant with an alcohol-related disorder nor did she \nnote that Applicant should discontinue drinking due to her prescribed medication. (GE 3 \nat 25, 27; GE 5; AE A; AE N; AE O; Tr. at 52-53; Tr. 2 at 24-25) \nAt the hearing, Applicant testified that her current mental health condition is \npositive.

Since receiving treatment at Facility X, where she received specialized treatment \nfor the first time since she was diagnosed with a psychological condition, she has received \nbetter medications, has realized how much she needs them, and how important they are \nto her wellbeing. Her medications are currently working for her. She saw her psychiatrist \nthe week before the first hearing. She takes her medications as prescribed and has no \nintention of discontinuing them.. (Answer; GE 3; GE 5; AE A; AE O; Tr. at 32, 45-46, 56-\n57) \nOn September 26, 2018, Applicant was evaluated by a board certified \nneuropsychologist hired by the DOD CAF to perform an evaluation. Applicant met with \nthe psychologist once for approximately two to three hours. The psychologist noted that \nApplicant was punctual, friendly, open, exhibited poor recall, showed no signs of \npsychosis, and she had normal affect. The psychologist administered the Personality \nAssessment Inventory (PAI) test. Applicant\u2019s results indicated that her clinical profile was \nentirely within normal limits, and there were no indications of significant psychopathology. \n\u201cHer profile indicates that she is generally a confident, resilient, and optimistic person.\u201d \n(Tr. at 68; GE 5) \nThe psychologist reviewed records provided to her by the DOD CAF, but her report \ndid not provide a detailed list of the documents she reviewed. Based upon statements in \nher report, she reviewed records that were not offered into evidence at the hearing by the \nGovernment, as various statements and references are not corroborated by the \nGovernment\u2019s exhibits that are in the record. Applicant signed multiple releases for her \ntreatment records at Facility X. However, the psychologist completed her evaluation on \nOctober 23, 2018, less than a month after interviewing Applicant. The Government \nreceived a copy of Applicant\u2019s records from Facility X on January 21, 2019, but did not \napparently submit them to the psychologist for an updated report. Additionally, in her \nSeptember 2019 response to DOHA interrogatories, Applicant provided a copy of the April \n2015 treatment records from the inpatient treatment facility mentioned above. Based upon \nher report, it is unclear if the DOD CAF psychologist reviewed a summary of the April \n2015 records from the Report of Investigation (ROI) or the actual records. (GE 3; GE 5) \nBased upon the documents available to her, her interview of Applicant, and the \nresults of the PAI test, the DOD CAF psychologist determined that as of October 2018 \nApplicant\u2019s: \nBipolar Disorder is quite severe and likely to require medical management \nfor the foreseeable future. She maintains that she has been consistently on \nher mood stabilizing medications for three years though this could not be \nverified by her current prescribers\u2026. Assuming [Applicant\u2019s] report is \naccurate that she is fully adherent to her medication regiment, that is clearly \nfavorable to her and additionally, she seems to have a supportive family that \nhelps her when she has a symptom breakthrough of her disorder, which is \nquite favorable. However, through the clinical interview, it is apparent that it \nis not uncommon for her to have some breakthrough symptoms of mania \non occasion, despite her claims of medication compliance.

(GE 5) \nThe DOD CAF psychologist noted that regarding Applicant\u2019s alcohol consumption: \nOf greatest concern is applicant\u2019s clear history of Alcohol Use Disorder, \nparticularly given her concomitant Bipolar I Disorder. My aforementioned \ninability to obtain any contemporaneous records from her treating \npsychiatrists or discuss [Applicant\u2019s] case with them has not allayed \nconcerns about her alcohol consumption or determine if her treating doctors \nare even aware she consumes alcohol while on her specified medication \nregimen. While the amount of alcohol [Applicant] claims to consume may \nbe relatively moderate for individuals without a concomitant serious mental \nillness, I am concerned that any amount of alcohol consumption in light of \nher co-occurring Bipolar Disorder may be contraindicated, given the severe \nnature of her symptoms as discussed above. As such, these factors indicate \na guarded prognosis. (GE 5) \nThe psychologist\u2019s 2018 report opined that at some point, Applicant\u2019s drinking may have \nbecome somewhat problematic again for a period, following a traumatic incident when \nshe was 30. However, after speaking to her mother, she reduced her consumption. \nUltimately, the psychologist determined that, \u201cApplicant\u2019s psychological condition and her \nalcohol consumption may have an untoward effect on her judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness. (GE 5; Tr. 2 at 21) \nApplicant discontinued drinking alcohol after she received the SOR in early \nDecember 2019. She attended 47 AA meetings from December 2019 until March 2020, \nwhen in-person meetings were cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic. From March \n2020 until the time of the hearing, she has been reading AA literature and the AA Big \nBook three to four times a week, and she has been attending church. She intends to \ncontinue to abstain from alcohol. Since she started working for her current employer in \n2016 until 2019, when she discontinued drinking, she drank two or three times a week, \nbut would typically consume less than one beer. When she was interviewed May 2017, \nby a Government investigator, Applicant indicated that she did not believe she had a \nproblem with alcohol. At the hearing, she reiterated that she does not consider herself to \nbe an alcoholic but recognizes that \u201calcohol has caused enough problems in [her] life \u2013 \nwith two DUIS, and now with the SOR \u2013 it\u2019s best to just leave it alone at this point.\u201d (GE \n4; AE B; Tr. at 33-36, 57-59, 72) \nThe DOD CAF psychologist also indicated that Applicant had trouble remembering \nthings during the interview; therefore, she concluded that Applicant was not as well \nstabilized as she claimed. At the reconvened hearing in May 2021, Applicant explained \nthat she was nervous and anxious about the evaluation due to its importance. In , addition, \nshe suffers from Attention-deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), which could have \naffected her recall ability during her interview with DOD CAF psychologist.

When she met with the psychologist, the psychologist, told her \nthat she did not have any of Applicant\u2019s medical records. Prior to meeting with the CAF \npsychologist, Applicant had signed release forms for all of her medical records. She asked \nthe CAF psychologist if they could call Facility X together to try to get copies of her \nrecords. They spent 45 minutes on the phone together trying to get the records faxed to \nthe CAF psychologist. A week later, Applicant followed up with the CAF psychologist, who \ntold her that she had not received the records yet. Applicant contacted Facility X again to \ntry to get the records to the CAF psychologist. (Tr. 2 at 15-16) \nApplicant\u2019s treating psychiatrist, Dr. B, wrote medical status letters in November \n2019, December 2020, and April 2021 for her. Dr. B\u2019s November 2019 letter, stating that \nApplicant has been compliant with her appointments and medication regimen and her \n\u201cmental illness has been stable. She showed good insight and judgement toward her \ncondition and necessary steps to maintain remission of her illness.\u201d In her December \n2020 letter, Dr. B reiterated that Applicant\u2019s \u201cmental health condition has been stable and \nin remission in the past year and a half with no medication adjustments needed. \n[Applicant] has been sober from alcohol for over a year now and denied having cravings \nfor alcohol.

Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988).) As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d (Egan at 527.) \nThe President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant \napplicants eligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d (EO 10865 \u00a7 2.) \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the AG. These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, \nrecognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge applies these \nguidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative \njudge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available and reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nAdverse clearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and \nshall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d (EO \n10865 \u00a7 7.) Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the \napplicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Security Executive Agent \nhave established for issuing national security eligibility. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions \nin the personal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant \nfrom being eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden \nof establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. (Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14.) \u201cSubstantial \nevidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d (See v. Washington \nMetro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994).) The guidelines presume a \nnexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria listed \ntherein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. (ISCR Case No. 92-1106 at 3, 1993 WL \n545051 at *3 (App. Bd. Oct. 7, 1993).) Once the Government establishes a disqualifying \ncondition, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. (Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.) An applicant has the burden of proving a potential mitigation, \nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. (ISCR Case No. 02-31154 \nat 5 (App. Bd.

The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while under \nthe influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or other \nincidents of concern, regardless of the frequency of the individual\u2019s alcohol \nuse or whether the individual has been diagnosed with alcohol use disorder;\nand \n \n(d) diagnosis by a duly qualified medical or mental health professional (e.g., \nphysician, clinical psychologist, psychiatrist, or licensed clinical social \nworker) of alcohol use disorder. \nApplicant\u2019s two DUI arrests and the 2018 diagnosis by the DOD CAF \npsychologist establish the above disqualifying conditions. \nAG \u00b6 23 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns raised under this \nguideline. Three are potentially applicable: \n(a) so much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or \ngood judgment;  \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her alcoholism or issues of alcohol \nabuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and \nhas established a pattern of abstinence (if alcohol dependent) or \nresponsible use (if an alcohol abuser);  \n12\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(c) the individual is participating in counseling or a treatment program, has \nno previous history of treatment and relapse, and is making satisfactory \nprogress in a treatment program; and \n(d) the individual has successfully completed a treatment program along \nwith any required aftercare, and has demonstrated a clear and established \npattern of modified consumption or abstinence in accordance with treatment \nrecommendations. \nApplicant had two DUIs over twenty years ago when she was abusing alcohol to \nself-medicate her undiagnosed and untreated psychological conditions. After successfully \ncompleting a treatment program in 2004, she maintained a three-year period of sobriety. \nIn 2004, Applicant was diagnosed with bipolar disorder (not specified), and started \nreceiving treatment for her depression and other psychological conditions, and she \ngradually resumed drinking in a responsible manner. She continued to consume alcohol \nfor ten years with no incidents or other alcohol-related issues. Applicant disclosed her \nconsumption of alcohol to her treating physicians, and they did not advise her to refrain \nfrom consuming alcohol due to either her underlying medical conditions or her prescribed \nmedications. \nFollowing Applicant\u2019s 2015 manic episode and subsequent inpatient treatment, \nApplicant voluntarily abstained from alcohol for approximately eight months. In 2016, she \nconsumed alcohol again moderately, disclosed her consumption to her physicians, and \nhad no additional alcohol-related incidents or issues. Throughout Applicant\u2019s Facility X \ntreatment records, she disclosed her consumption of alcohol, yet her treating psychiatrists \ndid not diagnosis her with an alcohol-related disorder nor recommend that she \ndiscontinue or decrease her consumption of alcohol. \nIn October 2018, the DOD CAF psychologist diagnosed Applicant with alcohol use \ndisorder, severe. However, it is unclear from the psychologist\u2019s report what specific \nrecords were reviewed in making this determination. Additionally, it is known for certain \nthat the doctor did not review Applicant\u2019s medical records from Facility X, the specialized \nfacility that treats individuals for a variety of psychiatric conditions, including addictions. \nIn December 2019, after the issuance of the SOR, Applicant voluntarily chose to \nabstain from alcohol, even though she does not consider herself to have an alcohol-\nrelated disorder. She has maintained her sobriety for almost two and a half years and \nregularly utilizes the principles of AA and her church to help her. She experiences no \nalcohol cravings, which was confirmed by her treating psychiatrist. None of Applicant\u2019s \nwork-related witnesses have observed her consuming alcohol. Her boyfriend of over five \nyears has never observed her abuse alcohol and testified to her sobriety. In April 2021, \nher treating psychiatrist indicated her history of alcohol abuse was in remission. Applicant \nmitigated the Guideline G concerns. \n13\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nGuideline I: Psychological Conditions \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for psychological conditions is set \nout in AG \u00b6 27: \nCertain emotional, mental, and personality conditions can impair judgment, \nreliability, or trustworthiness. A formal diagnosis of a disorder is not required \nfor there to be a concern under this guideline. A duly qualified mental health \nprofessional (e.g., clinical psychologist or psychiatrist) employed by, or \nacceptable to and approved by the U.S. Government, should be consulted \nwhen evaluating potentially disqualifying and mitigating information under \nthis guideline and an opinion, including prognosis, should be sought. No \nnegative inference concerning the standards in this guideline may be raised \nsolely on the basis of mental health counseling. \nThe guideline includes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 28. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) behavior that casts doubt on an individual\u2019s judgment, stability, reliability, \nor trustworthiness, not covered under any other guideline and that may \nindicate an emotional, mental, or personality condition, including, but not \nlimited to, irresponsible, violent, self-harm, suicidal, paranoid, manipulative, \nimpulsive, chronic lying, deceitful, exploitative, or bizarre behaviors; \n(b) an opinion by a duly qualified mental health professional that the \nindividual has a condition that may impair judgment, stability, reliability, or \ntrustworthiness; \n(c) voluntary or involuntary inpatient hospitalization; and \n(d) failure to follow a prescribed treatment plan related to a diagnosed \npsychological/psychiatric condition that may impair judgment, stability, \nreliability, or trustworthiness, including, but not limited to, failure to take \nprescribed medication or failure to attend required counseling sessions. \nThe record evidence established the above disqualifying conditions. Since she was \na young child, Applicant has suffered from depression. In 2004, she was diagnosed with \nbipolar disorder (not specified), and she has subsequently been diagnosed with bipolar I \ndisorder and received voluntary inpatient treatment in at least April 2015. At various times, \nApplicant has not been 100% compliant with various prescription treatment plans. \nAG \u00b6 29 provides the following conditions that could mitigate security concerns in \nthis case: \n14\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(a) the identified condition is readily controllable with treatment, and the \nindividual has demonstrated ongoing and consistent compliance with the \ntreatment plan; \n(b) the individual has voluntarily entered a counseling or treatment program \nfor a condition that is amenable to treatment, and the individual is currently \nreceiving counseling or treatment with a favorable prognosis by a duly \nqualified mental health professional; \n(c) recent opinion by a duly qualified mental health professional employed \nby, or acceptable to and approved by, the U.S. Government that an \nindividual\u2019s previous condition is under control or in remission, and has a \nlow probability of recurrence or exacerbation; \n(d) the past psychological/psychiatric condition was temporary, the situation \nhas been resolved, and the individual no longer shows indications of \nemotional instability; and \n(e) there is no indication of a current problem. \nApplicant has suffered with physiological disorders since at least 2004. At that \ntime, she was diagnosed with bipolar disorder, a life-long condition that is treated with \npharmacological and talk therapy intervention. Since April 2015, she has regularly \nreceived treatment from the same mental health practice, and she has seen the same \npsychiatrist since February 2017. Since her diagnosis was recently modified, she \ncontinues to follow her medication management plan. Her treating psychiatrist confirms \nher compliance and verifies her attendance at appointments. Although in the past, she \nhad not been 100% compliant with her treatment plan, there is sufficient evidence to \ndemonstrate that since starting treatment at Facility X in 2015, she is psychiatrically stable \nand functioning at an appropriate level. \nThe 2018 DOD CAF report indicated Applicant\u2019s psychological condition and her \nalcohol consumption may have an untoward effect on her judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness. It is difficult to afford much weight to this report given the inherent \nproblems that exist within the basis of the opinion. The report does provide details as to \nwhat documents were reviewed, and it is clear that the Government did not obtain actual \ncopies of Applicant\u2019s medical records from her April 2015 inpatient treatment and Facility \nX until after the psychologist completed her assessment. She may have reviewed ROI \nsummaries of various medical records, but because she failed to provide a list of the \ndocuments she reviewed it is not possible to determine how she arrived at her \nconclusions. Throughout her analysis, she indicates that she did not have copies of \nApplicant\u2019s most recent treatment records (from Facility X). Additionally, her one-time \nmeeting with Applicant was two to three hours, whereas, Applicant has been seeing her \ntreating psychiatrist regularly since February 2017. \n15\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \nThe seriousness of Applicant\u2019s underlying psychological conditions is not to be \nminimized. However, the statements of seven work-related witnesses, many of whom \nhave worked with her daily and have known her since April 2016, credibly attest to her \nability to function and perform at a high level on a consistent basis. Those favorable \nstatements are buttressed by her work performances reviews and many awards and \nletters of appreciation. Applicant has a lifelong psychological condition that she is properly \nmanaging through consistent treatment with her physician. She is open and forthright with \nher employer and coworkers regarding her condition, and they have not observed it \naffecting her ability to perform her job. Mitigation was established. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether the granting or continuing \nof national security eligibility is clearly consistent with the interests of national security \nmust be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful consideration of the \napplicable guidelines, each of which is to be evaluated in the context of the whole person. \nAn administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \n\u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nI have incorporated my comments under the guideline at issue in my whole-person \nanalysis, and I have considered the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). After weighing the disqualifying \nand mitigating conditions under this guideline, and evaluating all the evidence in the \ncontext of the whole person, I conclude that Applicant has mitigated psychological \nconditions and alcohol consumption security concerns at issue. Accordingly, Applicant \nhas carried her burden to show that it is clearly consistent with the interests of national \nsecurity of the United States to grant her eligibility for access to classified information. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline I:    \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 1.a: \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline G: \nFOR APPLICANT \n16\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n__________________________ \nSubparagraphs 2.a \u2013 2.b: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nI conclude that it is clearly consistent with the interests of national security of the \nUnited States to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified \ninformation.

He started this position in June 2017. Prior to that \nposition, he worked for another defense contractor (UBT) from June 2014 to April 2017, \nat which time he was fired. He obtained a secret security clearance in 2015. (Tr. 22-25; \nGE 1; AE D) In July 2017, he submitted his pending SCA. (GE 1) \nApplicant married his wife in 1999. Applicant described their marriage as \ncontentious at times. On March 3, 2016, they became embroiled in a serious physical \naltercation, which resulted in his arrest for assault and domestic violence. His wife filed \nfor divorce later in March 2016. The divorce was finalized in January 2017. They have \ntwo sons, ages 20 and 18. (Tr. 22-23; AE J) \nPsychological Conditions \nIn accordance with his divorce attorney\u2019s recommendation, on April 11, 2016, \nApplicant started counseling with Dr. B., a licensed psychologist. He told Dr. B. that he \nwas seeking treatment to address a recent incident that occurred between him and his \nwife of 16 years. He explained that his wife has had uncontrolled spending problems over \nthe years, much of which occurred without his knowledge. On March 3, 2016, he made a \ncomment to his wife about her weight, and she then ran after him and hit him in the ear. \nHe then slapped her. When the police arrived and saw the red mark on her face, they \narrested him and took him to jail for two nights. He denied having any sadness or remorse \nabout his wife\u2019s filing for divorce. He wanted to know if he had an anger problem or \nwhether his angry responses were reasonable given her spending problem. He admitted \nthat he made angry remarks to her and lost his temper, but denied that it was an ongoing \nissue. He told Dr. B. that \u201cwhen he has that reaction (rx) it is well justified.\u201d (Tr. 27; GE 4) \nDr. B. preliminarily diagnosed Applicant with an adjustment disorder, unspecified; \nand rule out impulse control disorder; need more information. She recommended that he \nparticipate in psychotherapy once a week. Subsequently, Dr. B saw Applicant 13 times \nfor therapy between April 25 and December 5, 2016.

Applicant completed a Personality Assessment \nInventory (PAI), which is a psychological test used to measure a test taker\u2019s attitude. (GE \n3 at 5) \nDuring the clinical interview with Dr. G., Applicant discussed his 17-year marriage \nand his wife\u2019s exorbitant spending.

He said they had a large argument when he \nlearned, after he was in an automobile accident, that he did not have insurance because \nshe had canceled it.

He \nsaid he had also left a nasty note on an employee\u2019s car that was parked in a manner such \nthat he could not move his car in the parking lot. He mentioned that he ran into a problem \nwith a woman who was critical of him at UBT, and was probably involved with his \ntermination from there.

The company found that: \n[Subject] had violated several base policies including using a government \nfurnished computer for personal use (emails, dating websites, group \nforums, and comics). Along with this, the customer reported that the subject \nhad been spending extended periods of time making personal phone calls \ndiscussing personal matters including his divorce. The Subject was also \nobserved to be viewing inappropriate material on his personal phone. (GE  \n5)  \nApplicant disclosed his termination from UBT in Section 13A-Employment \nActivities of his July 2017 SCA. He stated that he was \u201cfired over use of private cell phone \nwhich somebody considered inappropriate.\u201d (GE 2 at 14) He explained that: \nI was going through a divorce, my cell phone usage was necessary during \nthe day and I still got more work done than any of my peers. I was also \nwarned for having a game screenshot as my background, but plenty of \ngovernment folks around me were gaming far more than I ever did and far \nmore openly.  \nOn January 30, 2018, a government investigator interviewed Applicant about the \nabove termination and other matters.

At the end of September 2019, Applicant returned his copy with \ntwo pages of comments and notations next to certain paragraphs of the ROI. (GE 2) \nDuring his investigative interview, Applicant was asked questions related to the \nreasons why he was terminated from UBT. He said no one told him why he was fired, but \nhe knew it related to his cell phone use for making calls, texting, emailing his divorce \nlawyer, and receiving texts and group messages from friends. (GE 2 at 8-9). He denied \nthat he had work performance issues at his job. (GE 2 at 11) \nApplicant admitted to the investigator that he used his government phone and \nlaptop for email and calls to his lawyer, and denied any other uses. (GE 2 at 9) Later in \nthe interview, he admitted that he used his government laptop for reading comics, \naccessing hobby groups, news sites, and for personal matters. He said there were no \nrestrictions against doing that when he was on his break. (GE 2 at 10) \nWhen asked by the investigator if he had viewed pornography while at work, \nApplicant initially failed to answer the question, but then stated that he did not deny it. He \nhad viewed it, on his cell phone, after receiving anonymous texts or pranks with such \ncontent from other employees and women he was dating. He said examples of those \ntexts included videos, links to websites, or phone calls. (GE 2 at 10) He did not \nintentionally show those materials to anyone else. Someone who intruded on his space \ncould have viewed them however. (GE 2 at 11) \nApplicant told the investigator that he did not believe that his use of government \nequipment for some of the purposes previously stated was prohibited, as long as it did \nnot interfere with his work. He was aware that there were restrictions on viewing \npornographic material while at work. He stated that using government equipment to \naccess pornographic websites would be wrong, and that he never did that. (GE 2 at 12) \nIn his annotations to a paragraph on GE 2 at 11, he denied that he ever engaged in sexual \nmisconduct at work. (GE 2 at 4) \nApplicant testified that he used his work computer to check his personal emails, as \ndo other employees. He used it to read comics. He said employees were allowed to do \nthose activities before work and during their lunch. He denied that he used the computer \nfor dating websites. He said it would have been impossible because of the government\u2019s \nfirewall. (Tr. 47-51, 84-85) On a few occasions while at work, Applicant viewed \npornographic material on his phone that was sent to him by friends and a few women he \nwas dating. Some of his work friends also sent him texts or videos. (Tr. 86-89) \nOn cross-examination, Department Counsel noted that the investigator reported \non page 11 of GE 2 that Applicant told him that he had used his cell phone to visit websites \nthat had pornographic content two or three times a day between April 2016 and March \n2017, while at work. Department Counsel remarked that Applicant did not make any \ncorrections to that statement in the ROI. Applicant responded, stating that he must not \nhave read that statement correctly.

He did not receive a \ntermination letter. (Tr. 46, 79, 82) He has not been fired from an employer since this \nincident.

He told the investigator that on March 2, 2016, \nhe was in an automobile accident and learned that he did not have auto insurance \nbecause his wife failed to renew it. He and his wife then became embroiled in a verbal \nargument, as they were discussing the issue with their insurance agent. (GE 2 at 17) \nOn the following evening of March 3, 2016, Applicant confronted his wife about her \nspending habits after reviewing their bank statements. This argument lead to a physical \naltercation in which his wife punched him several times. He tried to hold her arms down, \nand he slapped her twice. When the police arrived, they noticed that she had red marks \non her face and arm. His wife pressed charges against him, and he was arrested and \ncharged with misdemeanor assault and domestic violence. (GE 2) \nWhile testifying, Applicant emphasized that the argument on March 3, 2016, \nstarted because he discovered that his wife had recently spent a lot of money and lied to \nhim about it. After he confronted her about the bills he found, the fight escalated to yelling \nand hostility, including his commenting on her weight. At some point, she approached him \nand he tried to disengage from her, but she ran after him and hit his ear. He said she was \npushing him into the kitchen where she grabbed a knife from the cutting block and started \nto swing it at him. He grabbed her wrist hard and got the knife out of her hand. She then \ncame after him again, at which point he struck her. After she left the house, a neighbor \ncalled the police. (Tr. 54-55, 68-74) \nDepartment Counsel cross-examined Applicant about the fact that he never \nmentioned that his wife grabbed a knife during their physical altercation on March 3, 2016, \nwhen he recounted the fight to Dr. B. in April 2016; when he spoke to the investigator in \nJanuary 2018; or during his evaluation with Dr. G. in January 2019. The first mention of \nhis wife holding a knife was during his interview with Dr. W. in January 2021. In response, \nApplicant said he was sure he mentioned the knife whenever the issue came up, and was \ncertain he told the police. (Tr. 75) He appeared surprised by that inquiry. \nApplicant said that his overall mood and mental health have improved since his \ndivorce became final in 2017. Both of his children live with him fulltime. (Tr. 38-39) He \nsaid his previous diagnosis of adjustment disorder was related to his divorce and loss of \nchildren at the time he saw Dr. B. in April 2016.

He was not at the office on the day Applicant \nwas terminated. He was aware that employees use their cell phones at work and \ngovernment laptops for personal issues throughout the day. He never observed a problem \nwith Applicant while he worked for him. (AE E) Two authors complimented Applicant for \nhis volunteer work as a soccer coach and as a father. (AE E, AE O) \nApplicant submitted his Employment Performance Evaluations for 2018, 2019, \n2020, and 2021. They generally rated Applicant as a solid performer. (AE G, AE N) \nPolicies \nThis national security eligibility action was taken under Executive Order 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; \nDOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program \n(January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the National Security Adjudicative \nGuidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information or Eligibility to \nHold a Sensitive Position (AG), which became effective within DOD on June 8, 2017. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility, the administrative judge \nmust consider the AG. In addition to brief introductory explanations for each guideline, \nthe AG list potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used \nin evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere \nspeculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 states an \u201capplicant is \n7 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nFinally, as emphasized in Section 7 of EO 10865, [a]ny determination under this \norder adverse to an applicant shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline I: Psychological Conditions \nAG \u00b6 27 describes the security concern relating to this guideline: \nCertain emotional, mental, and personality conditions can impair judgment, \nreliability, or trustworthiness. A formal diagnosis of a disorder is not required \nfor there to be a concern under this guideline. A duly qualified mental health \nprofessional (e.g., clinical psychologist or psychiatrist) employed by, or \nacceptable to and approved by the U.S. Government, should be consulted \nwhen evaluating potentially disqualifying and mitigating information under \nthis guideline and an opinion, including prognosis, should be sought. No \nnegative inference concerning the standards in this guideline may be raised \nsolely on the basis of mental health counseling. \nAG \u00b6 28 describes a condition that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying in this case: \n(b) an opinion by a duly qualified mental health professional that the \nindividual has a condition that may impair judgment, stability, reliability, or \ntrustworthiness. \nIn April 2016, Dr. B., a licensed psychologist, diagnosed Applicant with an \nadjustment disorder, unspecified, and rule out impulse control disorder. In May 2019, Dr. \nG., a licensed psychologist, diagnosed Applicant with a Personality Disorder, unspecified. \nHe made this diagnosis on the basis of Applicant\u2019s limited insight into his behaviors, a \ndefensive profile and rationalization of his behaviors. He opined that Applicant\u2019s condition \nmay demonstrate a moderate security concern. His prognosis was \u201csomewhat guarded.\u201d \n8 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe aforementioned conditions could impair Applicant\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness. \nThe evidence established a disqualifying condition under AG \u00b6 28(b). \nAG \u00b6 29 describes the following conditions that could mitigate security concerns \nunder this guideline: \n(c) recent opinion by a duly qualified mental health professional employed by, or \nacceptable to and approved by, the U.S. Government that an individual's previous \ncondition is under control or in remission, and has a low probability of recurrence \nor exacerbation; \n(d) the past psychological/psychiatric condition was temporary, the situation has \nbeen resolved, and the individual no longer shows indications of emotional \ninstability; and \n(e) there is no indication of a current problem. \nApplicant\u2019s most recent psychological evaluation was performed in January 2021, \nand was favorable to him. Dr. W. found that Applicant\u2019s profile presents no aggressive \nthreats, and indicates he is a low security concern. He arrived at his opinion having used \nthe same diagnostic methods as Dr. G. employed in January 2021. Based on this \nevaluation, Applicant\u2019s past adjustment disorder appears to be resolved, and there is no \ncurrent diagnosis of an impulsive disorder or personality disorder, unspecified. Dr. W. did \nnot report any diagnosis. Based on Applicant\u2019s performance evaluations from 2018 \nthrough 2021 and letters of recommendation, there is no evidence of a current \nemployment problem or behavioral issue. The evidence establishes mitigation under AG \n\u00b6\u00b6 29(c), 29(d), and 29(e). \nGuideline E: Personal Conduct \nAG \u00b6 15 explains the security concerns relating to personal conduct: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information.  \nAG \u00b6 16 describes a condition that could potentially raise a security concern and \nmay be disqualifying in this case: \n(d) credible adverse information that is not explicitly covered under any \nother guideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an adverse \ndetermination, but which, when combined with all available information, \nsupports a whole-person assessment of questionable judgment, \nuntrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with \nrules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that the individual \n9 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nmay not properly safeguard classified or sensitive information. This \nincludes, but is not limited to, consideration of: \n(2) any disruptive, violent, or other inappropriate behavior; \n(3) a pattern of dishonesty or rule violations; and \n(4) evidence of significant misuse of Government or other employer's time \nor resources. \nIn April 2017, Applicant was terminated from his position with a federal contractor \nfor a pattern of violating his employer\u2019s policies starting in 2016. Applicant used his \nemployer\u2019s computer for personal activities, which included sending and receiving emails, \nvisiting non-work related websites and group forums. He also spent long periods of time \non his cell phone for personal matters and to view inappropriate materials. The evidence \nestablished the above disqualifying conditions under AG \u00b6\u00b6 16(d)(2), (3), and (4). \nIn March 2016, Applicant became embroiled in a serious physical and verbal \naltercation with his wife, which resulted in his arrest for assault and domestic violence. \nThat criminal conduct was not alleged under any other guideline, but did demonstrate \ndisruptive behavior and raised questions about his trustworthiness and judgment. The \nevidence established the above disqualifying condition under AG \u00b6 16(d)(2). \nAG \u00b6 17 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns raised under this \nguideline. Two may potentially apply: \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; and \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, \nunreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to \nrecur. \nThere is evidence to establish some mitigation under AG \u00b6 17(c) for both SOR \nallegations. The allegations underlying \u2019s termination of Applicant in April 2017 included \nmultiple incidents of Applicant\u2019s misuse of his employer\u2019s equipment and his personal cell \nphone usage while at work. The offenses spanned two years and were not minor. \nHowever, for the past four and a half years, Applicant has been successfully working for \nDC, as documented by performance evaluations. Applicant\u2019s arrest for domestic violence \nwas not a minor offense, given the circumstances surrounding it. However, six years have \npassed since it occurred in March 2016 and he has been divorced since January 2017. \nBoth sons now reside with him and his former wife sometime visits him. There is no \nevidence of subsequent volatile encounters between them. \n10 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \nThere is minimal evidence to establish mitigation under AG \u00b6 17(d) as to either \nSOR allegation. Applicant admitted that he misused his employer\u2019s computer at times, \nand that he used his cell phone for personal matters, including viewing pornographic \nmaterials. He exhibited little remorse over his misconduct at his former job and at times \nminimized it. He took a four-hour behavioral conduct course in 2020 to help him address \nhis past termination. He offered no insight into his role in the circumstances that may have \ncontributed to the volatile fight with his wife in March 2016, and felt the situation was \nentirely her fault. He stated that since getting divorced in early 2017, his overall health \nhas improved and indicated that some of the stressors he was experiencing 2016 and \nearly 2017 have lessened. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant national security \neligibility must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of \nthe guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the potentially disqualifying \nand mitigating conditions in light of all pertinent facts and circumstances surrounding this \ncase. \nApplicant is 53 years old. He is divorced, since early 2017, and has two children \nwho live with him. He coaches soccer for school-age children. He is a systems engineer \nfor a defense contractor. He has worked for defense contractors since 2012, and his \ncurrent employer since 2017. His employer has rated him as a solid performer. He likes \nhis job. \nIn March 2016, Applicant and his wife engaged in an explosive physical argument, \nresulting in his arrest. After six months of counseling, his criminal case was dismissed by \nthe court. In January 2017, Applicant and his wife divorced. Since then, his two boys have \nmoved in with him. Applicant said he sees his former wife periodically when she visits him. \nThere is no evidence that they have engaged in physical altercations since March 2016. \nFrom sometime in 2016 to April 2017, Applicant worked for a defense contractor, \nat which time he was terminated for misusing his employer\u2019s equipment and using his \n11 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n    \n \n \n                                          \n \n \n \n                                 \n \n \n                                             \n \n \n                                             \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n____________________ \npersonal cell phone at work too often and at times inappropriately.

Although an investigator \nreported that Applicant stated that he used his cell phone several times a day for that \npurpose over two years, Applicant denied that he did so.

The investigator did not testify. \nDr. W.\u2019s January 2021 psychological evaluation sufficiently rebuts Dr. G.\u2019s \nevaluation that was performed by Dr. G. two years earlier. Dr. W. found Applicant \npresented with a low security risk. He stated that Applicant did not pose any aggressive \nthreats or show a tendency toward acting-out.

At about 2:15 a.m., \nhe got into his vehicle to drive to his residence located down the street. As he was leaving, \nthe police arrived in response to an unrelated disturbance complaint, and they stopped \nhis vehicle because it reportedly matched that of one of those unrelated disturbance \nparticipants. Applicant was administered a sobriety test which he passed. However, he \nwas also administered a breathalyzer test, and he apparently failed it. \nHe was charged with driving while intoxicated (DWI), a misdemeanor, and \narrested. In July 2012, he appeared before the city general district court and was found \nguilty as charged. He was sentenced to 365 days\u2019 confinement, suspended; unsupervised \nprobation for 12 months; his operator license was restricted (to and from work; to and \nfrom alcohol meetings; during work hours; for medically necessary travel; and to transport \na minor child) for one year until July 9, 2013; he was ordered to attend the state Alcohol \nSafety Action Program (ASAP), a 12-week alcohol awareness program; fined $250; and \nordered to pay $186 in costs.

He no longer drinks and \nthen drives, but readily uses car services like Uber or Lyft if he attends events where he \nexpects to consume alcohol; and he has not been intoxicated. (Answer to SOR at 3; GE \n2 at 15) \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b. and 2.b. refer to an incident in 2013 \u2013 approximately eight and one-\nhalf years ago: On October 3, 2013, while cohabiting with his girlfriend who was pregnant \nwith his youngest child, Applicant and his girlfriend engaged in a domestic dispute.

On this particular occasion, he brought home a large orange \njuice for himself and a small orange juice for his girlfriend. His girlfriend became upset \nbecause she wanted the larger drink. He explained that she always wasted the larger \nsize, but she continued to be upset. One thing led to another and he threw the drink into \nthe trash. The verbal dispute grew into a physical one. She yelled at him; tried to break \nhis work phone; and started kicking and punching him, and he pinned her against the wall \nin an effort to restrain her, \u201csimply to keep her still and to prevent her from injuring him.\u201d \nWhen things calmed down, he released her, but she demanded that he leave the house, \nand she called the police. (Answer to SOR at 4; GE 2 at 15-16) \nWhen the police arrived at the house, they were met by the girlfriend. She indicated \nthat she was pregnant, and that Applicant had pinned her against the wall and choked \nher. She claimed that when she told him he had to leave the house, he pushed her against \nthe wall \u201cwhere he held her and choked her with his bare hands until she lost \nconsciousness and passed out.\u201d The police noticed no signs of injury on the girlfriend and \nshe refused medical attention. She refused to provide a sworn written statement. When \nApplicant was questioned, he acknowledged the disagreement and stated that he had to \ngrab her and hold her against the wall. He denied ever choking her. (Tr. at 53) Based on \nthe facts obtained during the two interviews, the police found that \u201cprobable cause exists \nto charge the defendant with battery by strangulation \u2013 domestic violence, a 3rd  degree \nfelony; and aggravated battery on a pregnant female \u2013 domestic violence, a 2nd  degree \nfelony.

(GE 1 at 39; GE 2, at 16; GE 3 at 3-4; GE 5) \nOn December 19, 2013, based on an assessment of the facts before him, the State \nAttorney issued a No Information Notice stating that \u201c[f]rom the investigation which has \nbeen made, it is the opinion of the writer that this case is not suitable for prosecution.\u201d \n(AE F) All charges were dropped. (GE 3 at 4) \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c. and 2.c. refer to an incident  in 2016 \u2013 approximately six years ago: \nOn May 30, 2016, another incident occurred between Applicant and his girlfriend. \nApplicant was at a restaurant when a female patron stopped him and asked for directions \nto the airport. Applicant\u2019s girlfriend approached them and, thinking that Applicant had a \nrelationship with the woman, started \u201cattacking\u201d the woman. To escape the situation, he \ndeparted and returned to his residence which he no longer shared with his girlfriend. At \n4:00 a.m. that morning, the girlfriend arrived at his residence and texted him that she was \nthere with her \u201cboys\u201d and wanted to see how tough he was going to be. Concerned about \nhis own safety, he grabbed a kitchen knife for self-defense. As the girlfriend backed the \nvehicle closer to him, Applicant panicked when he thought he saw others in the car, and \nhe threw the knife at the car. The girlfriend drove away and Applicant retreated to his \nresidence. At 5:00 a.m., she texted him that a police report had been filed. (GE 1 at 39-\n40; GE 2 at 17; Answer to SOR at 5) \nThe girlfriend\u2019s story to the police was vastly different. She acknowledged some of \nthe issues involving Applicant and another woman, but claimed that after the incident she \nwas merely going to Applicant\u2019s residence to pick up their son. When she arrived at his \nhouse, he was standing outside without their son. She said she decided to make a U-turn \nand not encounter Applicant, and as she drove away, she heard a loud crashing sound \n4 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \non her rear windshield when it shattered.

(GE 6 at 1, 3) Applicant subsequently noted that their son was \nnot even with him that night, and that he was with her. (Tr. at 64) \nBefore Applicant was even interviewed, the police field report stated: \nThe suspect maliciously hurled a knife into the victim\u2019s vehicle while she \nwas driving away, knowing it could cause great bodily harm or death to \nvictim. The suspect consciously and intentionally, with reckless indifference \nto consequences and with the knowledge that damage is likely to be done \nthrew the knife at the victim\u2019s property causing monetary damage in the \namount of approximately $1000 dollars. Probable Cause was established \nto charge the suspect . . . with throwing deadly missile at, into occupied \nvehicle. \n(GE 6 at 1) \nApplicant was subsequently charged with throwing a deadly missile into occupied \ndwelling, vehicle, building, or aircraft, a 2nd degree felony. Applicant was reportedly\narrested on June 9, 2016. (GE 3 at 4-5; Answer to SOR at 3) However, on July 22, 2016,\nbased on an assessment of the facts before him, the State Attorney issued a No \nInformation Notice stating that \u201c[f]rom the investigation which has been made, it is the \nopinion of the writer that this case is not suitable for prosecution.\u201d (AE G) All charges were\ndropped. (GE 3 at 5) \n \n \n \n \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d. and 2.d. refer to an incident in 2018 \u2013 approximately four years ago: \nOn an unspecified date after May 2018, Applicant and two friends were in a vehicle rented \nby one of the friends. The renter of the vehicle had been drinking, so he was in the rear \nseat, while the other friend was driving. Applicant was a passenger. On the way to \nApplicant\u2019s residence, the driver fell asleep and the vehicle struck a parked vehicle. The \nrenter struck his head on something during the crash and he was bleeding. Applicant \npanicked because the injury looked severe. He tended to the injured friend, placing a shirt \non the injured head. The driver drove the vehicle to Applicant\u2019s residence and left it in the \ndriveway. Applicant drove his two friends to the hospital where they were met by a nurse. \nThe two friends entered the hospital and Applicant parked his vehicle. While he was \nparking his vehicle, the two friends apparently told the nurse that the injured friend had \nmerely fallen down the stairs without mentioning the vehicle accident. The injured friend \nreceived medical treatment and was transferred to another hospital. At some point, they \nretrieved the rental vehicle. Because the renter was wearing a neck brace and the driver \nwas too scared to drive it, Applicant drove it to another location. It was only after they \ntended to their injured friend did they realize that they had been involved in a hit-and-run \nincident. The following day, the driver and the renter reported the incident to the police \nand the rental company.

Applicant reported that when he was first hired by his current employer he held \na secret clearance, but his employer successfully sponsored him for top secret clearance. \nAfter being granted the top secret clearance, the employer sponsored him for top \nsecret/sensitive compartmented information (SCI). While the background investigation \nwas underway, two of the arrests were found, and as a result, according to two of his \nsecurity managers, his security clearance was revoked due to \u201chaving too many \noccurrences.\u201d He learned of the revocation through an email from his security department, \nand he was subsequently debriefed. He was not aware what steps were available to him. \nHe later was told that the clearance was no longer revoked, but was considered to be \npending. (GE 2 at 18) \nAlthough certain issues arose with respect to Applicant\u2019s security clearance \neligibility before October 2017 when his eligibility was either suspended or revoked, there \nis no evidence that he was timely issued an SOR or offered an appeal of the actions at \nany point before November 27, 2019 \u2013 the date of the current SOR. Moreover, because \nthe evidence is extremely skimpy, it remains unclear if Applicant\u2019s security clearance was \nactually suspended or revoked. \nSOR \u00b6 2.c. alleged that when Applicant completed his 2017 SF 86, in response to \na question in Section 13A \u2013 7, Employment Activities, \u201cProvide the reason for leaving the \nemployment activity,\u201d he falsified material facts when he answered \u201ccompany went out of \nbusiness\u201d and deliberately failed to disclose that his employment was terminated in \nJanuary 2008 due to attendance issues.

During his OPM interview, he claimed that he did not \nthink it was necessary to include the details in his SF 86, and instead simply said that the \ncompany had gone out of business. He was fired because his school schedule and work \nschedule were creating problems with his work attendance, and that if he was a few \nminutes late to work, he was assessed a certain number of points. Once the accumulation \nof points rose to a certain level, he was terminated.

(AE E) \nPolicies \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the Executive \nBranch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security emphasizing, \n\u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d (Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. \n518, 528 (1988)). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to control \naccess to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual \nis sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information. The standard that must be \nmet is that, based on all available information, the person\u2019s loyalty, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness are such that granting the person access to classified information is \nclearly consistent with the interests of national security. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines in SEAD 4. In addition to \nbrief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating \nan applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nAn administrative judge need not view the guidelines as inflexible, ironclad rules \nof law. Instead, acknowledging the complexities of human behavior, the administrative \njudge applies these guidelines in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative \nprocess. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. The entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of \nvariables known as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a meaningful decision. The concept recognizes that we should \nview a person by the totality of his or her acts, omissions, motivations and other variables. \nEach case must be adjudged on its own merits, taking into consideration all relevant \ncircumstances, and applying sound judgment, mature thinking, and careful analysis. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours as well. It is \nbecause of this special relationship that the Government must be able to repose a high \ndegree of trust and confidence in those individuals to whom it grants access to classified \ninformation. \nDecisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the applicant \nmay deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified information.

Furthermore, security clearance\ndeterminations should err, if they must, on the side of denials. (Department of the Navy\nv. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988)). In reaching this decision, I have drawn only those \nconclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on the evidence contained in the \nrecord. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere speculation or \nconjecture. \n \n \n \nAnalysis \nUpon consideration of all the facts in evidence, including those in the DOD CAF \ncase file, those submitted by Applicant, and his testimony, as well as an assessment of \nApplicant\u2019s demeanor and credibility, and after application of all appropriate legal \nprecepts and factors, I conclude the following with respect to the allegations set forth in \nthe SOR: \nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Criminal Conduct is set out in AG \n\u00b6 30: \nCriminal activity creates doubt about a person's judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person's ability or \nwillingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations. \nThe guideline notes two conditions under AG \u00b6 31 that could raise security \nconcerns: \n(a) a pattern of minor offenses, any one of which on its own would be \nunlikely to affect a national security eligibility decision, but which in \ncombination cast doubt on the individual's judgment, reliability, or \ntrustworthiness; and \n(b) evidence (including, but not limited to, a credible allegation, an \nadmission, and matters of official record) of criminal conduct, regardless of \nwhether the individual was formally charged, prosecuted, or convicted. \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 31(a) and 31(b) have been established with respect to the 2012, 2013, and \n2016 incidents. In April 2012, Applicant was charged with DWI, a misdemeanor, and \narrested. In July 2012, he appeared before the city general district court and was found \nguilty as charged. He was sentenced to 365 days confinement, suspended; unsupervised \nprobation for 12 months; his operator license was restricted (to and from work; to and \nfrom alcohol meetings; during work hours; for medically necessary travel; and to transport \na minor child) for one year until July 9, 2013; he was ordered to attend the state ASAP \nprogram, a 12-week alcohol awareness program; fined $250; and ordered to pay $186 in \ncosts. \n9 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nIn addition, in October 2013 and June 2016, following domestic disputes with his \ngirlfriend, he was charged with battery by strangulation \u2013 domestic violence, a 3rd  degree\nfelony; and aggravated battery on a pregnant female \u2013 domestic violence, a 2nd  degree\nfelony (in 2013); a\n nd throwing deadly missile into occupied dwelling, vehicle, building, or \naircraft, a 2nd  degree felony (in 2016). In both instances, based on an assessment of the\nfacts before them, the State Attorneys issued No Information Notices stating that \u201c[f]rom \nthe investigation which has been made, it is the opinion of the writer that this case is not \nsuitable for prosecution.\u201d All charges were dropped.  \n \n \n \nWith respect to the 2018 incident, Applicant was merely a passenger in a vehicle \nthat struck another vehicle and left the scene without immediately reporting it to the \nauthorities. Accordingly, the SOR alleged that Applicant\u2019s conduct in being present at the \naccident; the conduct of the driver in reportedly lying to medical personnel regarding the \ncause of the injuries sustained by another passenger when Applicant was not present; \nallegedly fleeing the scene of the accident; or someone reportedly falsely reporting to the \npolice that the vehicle was involved in a hit-and-run when Applicant was not present, all \nconstituted both criminal conduct and poor personal conduct. The SOR alleged that \nApplicant\u2019s conduct consisted of criminal conduct, but it did not identify the law that he \nsupposedly broke, and the government failed to produce any evidence other than \nApplicant\u2019s own description of the events to establish that his actions were criminal in \nnature. Applicant was merely a passenger in the vehicle, not the driver. He did not operate \nthe vehicle as a passenger; he did not encourage or enable the driver to drive knowing \nhe was unable or unfit to drive; and he did not interfere with the driver\u2019s ability to operate \nthe vehicle. Under these circumstances, as to the 2018 incident, neither AG \u00b6\u00b6 31(a) nor \n31(b) has been established. \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions under AG \u00b6 32 that could \nmitigate security concerns arising from Criminal Conduct: \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur and \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment;  \n(c) no reliable evidence to support that the individual committed the offense; \nand \n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including, but not limited \nto, the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, restitution, \ncompliance with the terms of parole or probation, job training or higher \neducation, \ngood \nemployment \nrecord, \nor \nconstructive \ncommunity \ninvolvement. \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 32(a), 32(c), and 32(d) apply. Appellant\u2019s DWI charge and conviction \noccurred in 2012, and in the ensuing decade no similar criminal conduct has taken place. \nHe attended ASAP and AA. He now drinks responsibly: he no longer drinks and then \ndrives, but readily uses car services like Uber or Lyft if he attends events where he \n10 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \nexpects to consume alcohol; and he has not been intoxicated. Considering the passage \nof one decade since the incident, without recurrence of any other similar alcohol-related \nconduct, it appears that he has rehabilitated himself. Similar alcohol-related conduct is \nunlikely to recur, and his past alcohol-related conduct no longer casts doubt on his \nreliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment. \nWith respect to the two domestic violence incidents that occurred in 2013 \u2013 \napproximately eight and one-half years ago \u2013 and 2016 \u2013 approximately six years ago \u2013 \nthere are substantial issues related to both incidents. As noted above, both incidents \ninvolved conflicting stories presented by Applicant and his ex-girlfriend, two individuals \nwho were in a toxic relationship. In one case, she claimed to the police that Applicant \n\u201cchoked her with his bare hands until she lost consciousness and passed out,\u201d but she \nhad no signs of injury and she refused medical attention. She also refused to provide a \nsworn written statement. In the other he was charged before he was even afforded the \nopportunity to explain his side of the story. The police reported that Applicant had \n\u201cmaliciously hurled a knife,\u201d that he \u201cconsciously and intentionally, with reckless \nindifference to consequences, threw the \u201cdeadly missile\u201d at her vehicle.\u201d Such phrases \nare filled with flowery prose, not stark facts. Although she lied to the police in 2016 when \nshe stated that she had never called the police, in fact, she did call the police against \nApplicant in 2013. In both instances, based on an assessment of the facts before them, \nthe State Attorneys issued No Information Notices stating that \u201c[f]rom the investigation \nwhich has been made, it is the opinion of the writer that this case is not suitable for \nprosecution.\u201d All charges were dropped. Applicant has moved on from that relationship. \nConsidering his positive character references and the passage of time since the most \nrecent incident, without recurrence of any other criminal conduct, it appears that he has \nrehabilitated himself. Similar conduct is unlikely to recur, and his past alleged criminal \nconduct no longer casts doubt on his reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment. \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Personal Conduct is set out in \nAG \u00b6 15: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. The following will normally result in \nan unfavorable national security eligibility determination, security clearance \naction, or cancellation of further processing for national security eligibility: \n(a) refusal, or failure without reasonable cause, to undergo or \ncooperate with security processing, including but not limited \nto meeting with a security investigator for subject interview, \ncompleting security forms or releases, cooperation with \n11 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nmedical \nor \npsychological \nevaluation, \nor \npolygraph \nexamination, if authorized and required; and \n(b) refusal to provide full, frank, and truthful answers to lawful \nquestions of investigators, security officials, or other official \nrepresentatives in connection with a personnel security or \ntrustworthiness determination. \nThe guideline also includes an example of a condition that could raise security \nconcerns under AG \u00b6 16: \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar \nform used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, \naward benefits or status, determine national security eligibility or \ntrustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities; \n(c) credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is \nnot sufficient for an adverse determination under any other single guideline, \nbut which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-person \nassessment of questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack \nof candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations, or other \ncharacteristics indicating that the individual may not properly safeguard \nclassified or sensitive information; and \n(d) credible adverse information that is not explicitly covered under any \nother guideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an adverse \ndetermination, but which, when combined with all available information, \nsupports a whole-person assessment of questionable judgment, \nuntrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with \nrules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that the individual \nmay not properly safeguard classified or sensitive information. This \nincludes, but is not limited to, consideration of: . . . (2) any disruptive, violent, \nor other inappropriate behavior; (3) a pattern of dishonesty or rule violations. \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 16(a), 16(c), and 16(d) have been established. My discussion related to \nApplicant\u2019s criminal conduct is adopted herein. Applicant was charged and convicted of \nDWI in 2012; charged with two domestic violence incidents that occurred in 2013 and \n2016, both of which were subsequently dismissed; fired from one employer in 2016; had \nhis security clearance suspended or revoked in 2017, reportedly because of the three \ncriminal incidents between 2012 and 2016; and furnished an incorrect response to a \nquestion in his 2017 SF 86. The allegation regarding his alleged criminal conduct and \nunacceptable personal conduct while a passenger in a vehicle that was involved in a hit-\nand-run in 2018 is the sole exception in that none of the conditions identified have any \napplication to the incident. \n12 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n   \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions under AG \u00b6 17 that could \nmitigate security concerns arising from personal conduct. They include: \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, \nunreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to \nrecur; and \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate vulnerability \nto exploitation, manipulation, or duress. \nAG \u00b6 17(c), 17(d), and 17(e) apply. Appellant\u2019s DWI charge and conviction \noccurred in 2012 \u2013 a decade ago; and the two domestic violence incidents occurred in \n2013 \u2013 approximately eight and one-half years ago \u2013 and 2016 \u2013 approximately six years \nago. Applicant learned from the DWI, and after attending ASAP and AA, he modified his \nconsumption of alcohol and has had no similar incidents. The two domestic violence \nincidents occurred while he was in a toxic relationship with his ex-girlfriend, and since \nthey are no longer in a relationship \u2013 except that they share custody of a child \u2013 it is \nunlikely that such conduct will recur. \nApplicant was fired from his employment with an employer in December 2016 \u2013 \nnearly five and one-half years ago \u2013 due to his failure to follow standard attendance \nprotocol. He explained that a company matrix reported how many calls were received, \ntickets created, tickets closed, and the feedback from customers. The minimum \nrequirement was 98.9. Because, at times, he was unable to be available for work, or he \ntook longer breaks than permitted, or he took longer than allowed to close out calls, his \nperformance was inconsistent and suffered. As a result, he was fired. The government \noffered no documentary evidence from the employer to support the allegation or to \nchallenge Applicant\u2019s comments. Since that relatively minor incident, he has taken \npositive steps to alleviate the stressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to his \nemployment difficulties: he is no longer in the toxic relationship; he has completed his \neducation; and he is a new work environment where he is treasured, respected, and liked. \nAs noted above, according to two of Applicant\u2019s security managers, and as alleged \nin the SOR, his security clearance was revoked due to \u201chaving too many occurrences.\u201d \nHe learned of the revocation through an email from his security department, and he was \nsubsequently debriefed. He was not aware what steps were available to him. He later \nwas told that the clearance was no longer revoked, but was considered to be pending. \nAlthough certain issues arose with respect to Applicant\u2019s security clearance eligibility \nbefore October 2017 when his eligibility was either suspended or revoked, there is no \nevidence that he was timely issued an SOR or offered an appeal of the actions at any \n13 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \npoint before November 27, 2019 \u2013 the date of the current SOR. Moreover, because the \nevidence is extremely skimpy, it remains unclear if Applicant\u2019s security clearance was \nactually suspended or revoked. In addition, if his security clearance was suspended or \nrevoked in 2017, it appears that any such action was done without affording him \nappropriate due process in violation of Exec. Or. 10865; the Directive; and SEAD 4. \nIt was alleged that Applicant falsified material facts in his 2017 SF 86 when he \nanswered \u201ccompany went out of business\u201d and deliberately failed to disclose that his \nemployment was terminated in January 2008 due to attendance issues. He denied that \nhe intended to falsify the truth or intentionally failed to disclose how he was terminated. \nDuring his OPM interview, he claimed that he did not think it was necessary to include the \ndetails in his SF 86, and instead simply said that the company had gone out of business. \nIn fact, he was fired because his school schedule and work schedule were creating \nproblems with his work attendance, and that if he was a few minutes late to work, he was \nassessed a certain number of points. Once the accumulation of points rose to a certain \nlevel, he was terminated. On October 28, 2009, when he completed an earlier SF 86, \nApplicant was more thorough in responding to the same inquiry, and had no motivation \nto subsequently obscure it. He stated: \u201cI was fired due (sic) to conflict with school schedule \nand work schedule causing me to be (sic) late.\u201d The government offered no documentary \nevidence from the employer to support the allegation or to challenge Applicant\u2019s \ncomments. While there is evidence of an incorrect response, there is no evidence that \nApplicant intentionally falsified his response or intended to obfuscate the truth, especially \nin light of his 2009 response. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the appellant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. Moreover, I have \nevaluated the various aspects of this case in light of the totality of the record evidence \nand have not merely performed a piecemeal analysis. (See U.S. v.

Applicant was \ncharged and convicted of DWI in 2012; charged with two domestic violence incidents that \noccurred in 2013 and 2016, both of which were subsequently dismissed; fired from one \nemployer in 2016; had his security clearance suspended or revoked in 2017, reportedly \nbecause of the three criminal incidents between 2012 and 2016; and furnished an \nincorrect response to a question in his 2017 SF 86. \nThe mitigating evidence under the whole-person concept is simply more \nsubstantial. Applicant is a 39-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has been \nserving as a cybersecurity systems engineer with his current employer since January \n2017. He previously worked for another employer as a functional analyst (July 2010 \u2013 \nDecember 2016). A 2001 high school graduate, he received an associate\u2019s degree in \n2009, a bachelor\u2019s degree in 2010, and a master\u2019s degree in 2016. He enlisted in the U.S. \nNavy in January 2002, and served on active duty until March 2006, when he was \nhonorably discharged as an AZ3 (E4). He remained in the U.S. Navy Reserve (Inactive) \nuntil 2008. He was initially granted a security clearance in 2002, and he eventually held \na top secret clearance. He has two children, born in 2006 and 2014. He has sole custody \nof the older child since 2017, and shares custody of the younger child. His character \nreferences, including his current Cyber Security Manager, think very highly of him. \nOverall, the evidence leaves me without questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s \neligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all of these reasons, I conclude \nApplicant has mitigated the security concerns arising from his criminal conduct and \npersonal conduct. See SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6\u00b6 2(d)(1) through 2(d)(9). \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline J: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a. and 1.d.: \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline E: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 2.a. through 2.d.: \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 3, Guideline F: \nWITHDRAWN \nSubparagraph 3.a.: \nWithdrawn \n15 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security clearance. \nEligibility for access to classified information is granted. \nROBERT ROBINSON GALES \nAdministrative Judge \n16 \n",
