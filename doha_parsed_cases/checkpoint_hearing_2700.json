(Tr. 7) \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant is 57 years old. He married in 1993, separated in 2007, and his divorce \nwas final in 2010. He has two children of this marriage, a son, age 25, and a daughter, \nage 23. He received a bachelor\u2019s degree in electrical engineering in 1995. \nApplicant worked for a large federal contractor between 1983 and March 2012. \nThe Department of Defense (DOD) granted him eligibility for a clearance first in 1985, \nand later in 2008. He stated that he never had any security issues or concerns, except \nfor those in the SOR. His employer laid him off for economic reasons beyond Applicant\u2019s \ncontrol, and he was unemployed between March 2012 and July 2013. He had difficulty \nfinding another engineering job and became a truck driver in July 2013. He obtained a \ncommercial driver\u2019s license and worked as a commercial truck driver until December \n2017. Another federal contractor hired him in December 2017, and his current employer \nand security sponsor hired him in March 2019. \nApplicant has continuously worked for federal contractors since 2017, initially \nmaking about $111,000 annually. (Tr. 42) He testified that in 2019, when he started \nworking with his current employer, he was making about $135,000 a year. He claimed he \nis currently earning about $150,000 a year. (Tr. 41-42) I note; however, that his IRS \naccount transcript for tax year 2021 shows his adjusted gross income to be close to \n$112,000. (AE 5) \nApplicant submitted his most recent security clearance application (SCA) on\nJanuary 7, 2018, seeking the continuation of his clearance eligibility required for his job. \nIn Section 26 (Financial Record) of his 2018 SCA, he disclosed he filed for a Chapter 13 \nreorganization in February 2016 (alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.a), and was delinquent in his child \nsupport payments to a state\u2019s child support enforcement agency (alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.b - \n$59,219 in arrearages).\n \n \nApplicant explained that his financial problems were the result of his acrimonious \ndivorce, his 13-month period of unemployment, and being underemployed between July \n2013 and December 2017. He stated that upon his divorce in 2010, the court required \nhim to pay approximately $2,000 a month in financial support for both children, and $2,000 \nin alimony to his ex-wife. (Tr. 21) Applicant\u2019s earnings as a commercial truck driver were \nless than what he was making before his divorce, and he could not make the court-\nordered child support and alimony payments and still pay for his living expenses. He fell \nbehind in his mortgage and homeowner\u2019s association payments. He consulted with an \nattorney who advised him to file for a Chapter 13 reorganization to avoid losing his home. \nApplicant filed for Chapter 13 reorganization in February 2016. He participated in \nthe reorganization and made the scheduled payments until July 26, 2019.

The court order dismissing the Chapter 13 case stated that the \u201cDebtor failed to \ncure the default in payments under the Debtor\u2019s plan.\u201d (GE 7, pgs. 24, 25, and 37) I note \nthat Applicant repeatedly testified at his hearing that he did not know why the bankruptcy \njudge dismissed his Chapter 13 case. (Tr. 72-74) \nThe Chapter 13 Trustee\u2019s Final Report and Account, from November 2019 (GE 7), \nshows that Applicant paid about $62,000 into the reorganization plan, and was refunded \nover $10,000. The only creditors that received any money were the mortgage holder \n($38,426); the HOA ($3,377); the IRS ($231); and Applicant\u2019s bankruptcy attorney \n($6,050). There were 12 additional creditors included in the bankruptcy schedule that \nreceived no payments from the Chapter 13 trustee, including a state child support \nenforcement agency. The remaining creditors\u2019 claims totaled close to $52,000. \nAfter the dismissal of his Chapter 13 case in July 2019, Applicant did not contact \nany of his creditors, and he made no payments toward his delinquent debts. At his \nhearing, he testified that since 2019 he has received no correspondence or collection \nnotices from any of his creditors. Only one of his creditors provided him with an IRS 1099-\nC (cancellation of debt). (Tr. 60) Although he did not pay his delinquent debts, and his \nChapter 13 case was dismissed, Applicant believes he owes no money to any of the \nbankruptcy-scheduled creditors. The credit reports no longer list the bankruptcy creditors. \nHe claimed he does not know what happened to his unpaid delinquent debts after the \nChapter 13 dismissal. (Tr. 59-60) He presented no evidence of any payments made to \nany of the bankruptcy creditors, except for the child support payments and the alimony \npayments being garnished from his paycheck. \nApplicant described his current financial situation as \u201cfantastic\u201d. He noted he is \ngetting caught up with his finances. (Tr. 32-33) He recently paid up his entire child support \nobligation in arrears. (AE 8) Both children are now emancipated, and he no longer has a \nlegal financial obligation toward the children. He owes about $20,000 in alimony to his ex-\nwife that he is paying via a $1,000-a-month garnishment of wages. \nApplicant\u2019s personal financial statement (AE 6) indicates he owns six vehicles with \nan aggregate value of over $110,000. He purchased a used 2019 Tundra for $52,000 in \n2021. He has no money in his savings account and only about $1,600 in his checking \naccount. He has about $30,000 in his 401K retirement account, but he took a $16,000 \nloan against his retirement account to pay off a debt to his ex-wife. \nApplicant presented no documentary evidence of any contacts with his bankruptcy \ncreditors, of any settlements made, of payment agreements established, or of any \npayments made after the Chapter 13 case dismissal or after receipt of the SOR. Other \nthan the financial counseling required for his Chapter 13 filing in 2016, he presented no \nevidence showing that he has participated in any recent financial counseling. His personal \nfinancial statement shows a net remainder of $3,060 a month. \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant claimed that he takes his responsibilities as a security clearance holder \nvery seriously. He noted that he has had a clearance since age 19. He considers himself \nto be a trustworthy person who pays his bills and does his job. \nPolicies \nThe SOR was issued under Executive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information Within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (Directive) \n(January 2, 1992), as amended; and the National Security Adjudicative Guidelines for \nDetermining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information or Eligibility to Hold a Sensitive \nPosition (AGs), applicable to all adjudicative decisions issued on or after June 8, 2017. \nEligibility for access to classified information may be granted \u201conly upon a finding \nthat it is clearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended. The \nU.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the Executive Branch in \nregulating access to information pertaining to national security, emphasizing that \u201cno one \nhas a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 \n(1988). \nThe AGs list disqualifying and mitigating conditions for evaluating a person\u2019s \nsuitability for access to classified information. Any one disqualifying or mitigating condition \nis not, by itself, conclusive. However, the AGs should be followed where a case can be \nmeasured against them, as they represent policy guidance governing access to classified \ninformation. Each decision must reflect a fair, impartial, and commonsense consideration \nof the whole person and the factors listed in SEAD 4, App. A \u00b6\u00b6 2(d) and 2(f). All available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, must \nbe considered. \nSecurity clearance decisions resolve whether it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant or continue an applicant\u2019s security clearance. The Government \nmust prove, by substantial evidence, controverted facts alleged in the SOR. If it does, the \nburden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts. The \napplicant bears the heavy burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant or continue his or her security clearance.  \nPersons with access to classified information enter into a fiduciary relationship with \nthe Government based on trust and confidence. Thus, the Government has a compelling \ninterest in ensuring each applicant possesses the requisite judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness of those who must protect national interest as their own. The \u201cclearly \nconsistent with the national interest\u201d standard compels resolution of any reasonable doubt \nabout an applicant\u2019s suitability for access in favor of the Government. \u201c[S]ecurity \nclearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. \nat 531; SEAD 4, \u00b6 E(4); SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6\u00b6 1(d) and 2(b). Clearance decisions are not \na determination of the loyalty of the applicant concerned. They are merely an indication \nthat the applicant has or has not met the strict guidelines the Government has established \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nfor issuing a clearance. (See Section 7 of EO 10865; See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) \n(listing prerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information)) \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds . . . .  \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nThe SOR alleges, Applicant admitted, and the evidence corroborates he filed for \nChapter 13 bankruptcy in 2016, which was dismissed in 2019 (SOR \u00b6 1.a); and that he \nwas indebted to a state for court-ordered child support and alimony in arrears. (SOR \u00b6 \n1.b). The record establishes the disqualifying conditions in AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and 19(c), \nrequiring additional inquiry about the possible applicability of mitigating conditions. \nIn ISCR Case No. 10-04641 at 4 (App. Bd. Sept. 24, 2013), the DOHA Appeal \nBoard explained Applicant\u2019s responsibility for proving the applicability of mitigating \nconditions as follows:  \nOnce a concern arises regarding an Applicant\u2019s security clearance \neligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance of \na security clearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th \nCir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991). After the Government \npresents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the \napplicant to rebut or mitigate those concerns. See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. The \nstandard applicable in security clearance decisions is that articulated in \nEgan, supra. \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access \nto classified information will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nDirective, Enclosure 2 \u00b6 2(b).  \n5 \n\n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nConditions that could mitigate the financial considerations security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 20. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control;  \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue. \nThe above mitigating conditions are not applicable to SOR \u00b6 1.a, but they apply \nand mitigate the allegations in SOR \u00b6 1.b. Circumstances beyond Applicant\u2019s control \n(2010 divorce, and unemployment and underemployment) caused him to file for a \nChapter 13 reorganization in 2016, and could have prevented him from diligently \naddressing his delinquent debts. \nWhile I accept that Applicant\u2019s financial problems were aggravated by \ncircumstances beyond his control, his evidence is insufficient to show that he was \nfinancially responsible under his circumstances. Applicant started working for a federal \ncontractor in December 2017, earning $111,000 a year. His current employer hired him \nin March 2019, with a starting salary of about $135,000 a year that has increased to his \ncurrent earnings of about $150,000 a year. \nApplicant participated in his Chapter 13 process for almost three years (2016\u00ad\n2019) paying about $62,000. During 2019, he failed to make the required payments to \nthe Chapter 13 trustee, and the court dismissed his case. Applicant\u2019s evidence is \ninsufficient to explain the circumstances that led him to miss his bankruptcy payments. \nApplicant testified that he did not know why the court dismissed his Chapter 13 case. His \ntestimony is not credible. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFollowing the Chapter 13 case dismissal, Applicant failed to contact the creditors \nlisted in his bankruptcy schedule of creditors. He presented no documentary evidence of \nefforts to contact his creditors, of payments made, of settlements agreements, or of \npayment plans established after the case was dismissed or after he received the SOR in \n2021. I am unable to find that he acted responsibly under the circumstances or that he \nmade a good-faith effort to pay his debts. Considering his annual earnings since 2017, \nApplicant\u2019s evidence is insufficient to explain why he was unable to address his Chapter \n13 financial responsibilities or the delinquent accounts unresolved by the case dismissal. \nI resolve the SOR \u00b6 1.b allegation for Applicant. His documentary evidence shows \nthat he paid his child support arrears in about May-June 2022, and he is making spousal \nsupport payments via a garnishment order. \nConsidering the evidence as a whole, there is insufficient evidence for a \ndetermination that Applicant has been financially responsible and that his financial \nproblems are under control. His financial issues are recent and ongoing. They continue \nto cast serious doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. I find \nthat the security concerns arising out of Applicant\u2019s financial problems are not mitigated. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. \nApplicant, 57, has been working for federal contractors, on and off, since he was \n19 years old, sometimes while possessing eligibility for a clearance. His financial \nproblems were aggravated by circumstances beyond his control and he filed for Chapter \n13 reorganization in 2016, which was dismissed in 2019. \nApplicant\u2019s evidence is insufficient to explain why he defaulted on his bankruptcy \npayments, and why he did not address his delinquent accounts after the Chapter 13 case \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nwas dismissed. He did not provide persuasive documentary evidence showing he made \nspecific and reasonable offers to settle the bankruptcy debts. His lack of documented \nresponsible financial action in regard to these debts raises unmitigated questions about \nhis reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified information. See AG \u00b6 18. \nOf greater concern, impinging on Applicant\u2019s credibility, honesty, and \ntrustworthiness, is his testimony that he did not know why the court dismissed his Chapter \n13 case. The record evidence leaves me with serious questions and doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. \nIt is well settled that once a concern arises regarding an applicant\u2019s security \nclearance eligibility, there is a strong presumption against granting a security clearance. \nSee Dorfmont, 913 F. 2d at 1401. \u201c[A] favorable clearance decision means that the record \ndiscloses no basis for doubt about an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified \ninformation.\u201d ISCR Case No. 18-02085 at 7 (App. Bd.

On April 19, 2022, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) \nissued a notice of video teleconference hearing, scheduling the hearing for May 10, 2022. \nThe hearing was held as scheduled. I received seven Government exhibits, \nmarked and identified as Government Exhibit (GE) 1 through GE 7, and 12 exhibits of \nApplicant marked and identified as Applicant\u2019s Exhibit (AE) A through AE L, and I \nconsidered the testimony of Applicant. The transcript (Tr.) was received on May 20, 2022. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant is a 47-year old single woman with seven children, ranging in age from \n9 to 27. She was married previously from 2003 to 2020. The marriage ended in divorce. \n(GE 1 at 25) Applicant\u2019s ex-husband has custody of the minor children. (Tr. 18) \nAfter graduating from high school, Applicant earned two associate degrees. (GE 1 \nat 14) She is a veteran of the U.S. Air Force, serving from 1993 to 2015. She retired \nhonorably. (GE 1 at 21) According to a former Air Force supervisor, Applicant performed \nall of her tasks \u201cwith enthusiasm, dedication, and attention to detail.\u201d (AE K at 1) While \nworking for this supervisor, Applicant\u2019s stellar performance led to a promotion to a position \n\u201ccommensurate with someone with much more experience.\u201d (AE K at 1) She has held a \nsecurity clearance for 21 years. \nApplicant currently works for a contractor, as a production planner. She has been \nworking at this position since August 2021. (Tr. 20) \nIn November 2015, after Applicant retired from the Air Force, she and her then \nhusband started a commercial cleaning business. (Tr. 23) A significant portion of their \nbusiness derived from a prime contractor who paid her to provide cleaning services on a \nlocal military base. Initially, the business was successful. However, the prime contractor \nstopped making timely payments a few months after entering into the contract. (Tr. 23) \nThis problem gradually worsened until the contractor stopped making payments \naltogether. (Tr. 24) \nApplicant and her then husband consulted law firms about suing the contractor. \n(Tr. 25) However, no firm was willing to take the case, explaining that the size of the \ncontractor\u2019s company and the contractor\u2019s clout in the community would make the case \ntoo labor-intensive and expensive to litigate. (Tr. 25) \nThe failure of the contractor to pay Applicant and her then husband strained their \nfinances, as they had to scramble to pay their employees and their business expenses. \n(Tr. 26) Gradually, they began falling behind on their payroll taxes and their state \nemployment taxes. Ultimately, they became unable to pay their personal debts. (GE 2 at \n6) \nIn September 2018, Applicant and her then husband filed for Chapter 13 \nbankruptcy protection, as alleged in SOR subparagraph 1.a. Approximately $87,000 of \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \ndebts were included in the plan. (GE 3 at 9) As part of the bankruptcy proceeding, \nApplicant\u2019s home was sold at foreclosure. (GE 2 at 14) Also, as part of the bankruptcy \nplan, Applicant was required to attend financial counseling. (Tr. 34) Applicant had no \nfinancial problems before the business failed. \nBy late 2019, Applicant and her then husband\u2019s financial problems had begun to \nstress their marriage. (Tr. 33) In February 2020, Applicant filed for divorce. As part of their \nseparation agreement, Applicant and her then husband agreed to split the Chapter 13 \nbankruptcy payments. The divorce was finalized by December 2020. (Tr. 56) \nSubsequently, Applicant\u2019s husband reneged on the terms of the separation agreement, \nleading to the dismissal of the bankruptcy plan for failing to make the court-ordered \npayments. (GE 3 at 2; Tr. 33) \nIn addition to the bankruptcy filing, the SOR alleges that Applicant has incurred \nfive delinquent debts, as alleged in subparagraphs 1.b through 1.f, and that Applicant has \ndelinquent business tax debt, as alleged in subparagraph 1.g. Subparagraph 1.b, totaling \n$6,640, is a credit card account. Applicant has been making $75 monthly payments since \nMarch 2021. (AE C \u2013 AE E) As of the date of the hearing, the outstanding balance was \n$5,515. (GE C at 1) \nSubparagraphs 1.c through 1.e are all owed to the same creditor. Applicant \ntestified that two of these debts constitute the same car loan that erroneously appears \ntwice on the credit report, and that she was not sure which ones were the duplicates. (Tr. \n62) Subparagraph 1.c, totaling $9,899, is clearly not the same debt alleged in \nsubparagraphs 1.d and 1.e because it is a delinquent credit card debt, and subparagraphs \n1.d and 1.e are both auto loans.(GE 5 at 3) Because the record indicates that \nsubparagraphs 1.d and 1.e are both auto loans that were opened on the same day with \nthe same account number (GE 5 at 3 \u2013 4), I conclude that Applicant\u2019s contention that two \nof three debts allegedly owed to the creditor referenced in subparagraphs 1.c through 1.e \nbeing duplicate car loans, is substantiated.  \nApplicant contends that the debts alleged in subparagraphs 1.c and 1.d, as \nduplicated in 1.e, were her ex-husband\u2019s responsibility and that she was merely an \nauthorized user on the accounts. (Answer at 2-3) In support of this contention, she \nreferenced a credit report that she submitted into evidence which indicates that her \nresponsibility to pay them had been terminated. (AE A at 6) She referenced a divorce \nagreement that designated responsibility to her ex-husband to pay them (Tr. 62), but did \nnot provide a copy of any such agreement. \nThe debt alleged in subparagraph 1.f, totaling $5,379, is a credit card debt. \nApplicant has contacted representatives of the creditor approximately 20 times to arrange \na payment plan, and no one has been able to find a record that she owes it. (Tr. 41; AE \nF) \nThe debt alleged in subparagraph 1.g, totaling $45,000, is delinquent payroll taxes \nrelated to the failure of Applicant\u2019s business. (Tr. 44) Between 2016 and 2020, the IRS \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \napplied approximately $17,000 of refunds from Applicant\u2019s personal income tax returns \nto her business delinquency. (AE H; Tr. 45) \nIn 2021, Applicant made two payments towards the satisfaction of her tax debt, \ntotaling $390. (AE B, AE G) Recently, Applicant contacted the IRS to arrange a payment \nplan. Her request was rejected, and the account was placed in non-collectible status \nbecause the IRS agent concluded that she did not have enough disposable income to \nexecute a payment plan at this time. (Tr. 48) \nApplicant maintains a budget. She has $243 of monthly disposable income. (AE L) \nPolicies \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion the Executive \nBranch has in regulating access to information pertaining to national security, \nemphasizing that \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy \nv. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). When evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security \nclearance, the administrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are required to be \nconsidered in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of \nhuman behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the \nadjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overall adjudicative goal is a fair, \nimpartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a \nconscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d \nThe administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the \nperson, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 1(d) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present \nevidence to establish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, \nthe applicant is responsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, \nexplain, extenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department \nCounsel. . ..\u201d The applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable \nsecurity decision. \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must consider the \ntotality of an applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant circumstances in light of the nine\nadjudicative process factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). They are as follows: \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; \n(2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nparticipation;  \n(3) the frequency and recency of the conduct;  \n(4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct;  \n(5) the extent to which participation is voluntary;  \n(6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent \nbehavioral changes;  \n(7) the motivation for the conduct;  \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and  \n(9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nAnalysis \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nUnder this concern, \u201cfailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to \nabide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about an individual\u2019s \nreliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified or sensitive information.\u201d (AG \u00b6 \n18)  \nApplicant\u2019s history of financial problems triggers the application of AG \u00b6 19(a), \n\u201cinability to satisfy debts,\u201d and AG \u00b6 19(c), \u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations.\u201d \nHer history of delinquent federal payroll taxes triggers the application of AG \u00b6 19(f), \n\u201cfailure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income tax returns or \nfailure to pay annual Federal state, or local income tax as required.\u201d \nThe following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially applicable to the \nremaining SOR allegations: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce, or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts;  \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue; and \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority \nto file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \nApplicant\u2019s inability to pay her debts on time was not caused by foolish or profligate \nspending. Instead it stemmed from the failure of her business and her subsequent \ndivorce. In early 2021, a few months after her divorce was finalized, Applicant began \nattempting to contact creditors, including the holder of the debt alleged in subparagraph \n1.b.  She organized a payment plan with this creditor, to which she has been adhering \nsince March 2021. Moreover, she has dutifully been making efforts to initiate the payment \nof the debt alleged in subparagraph 1.f, but representatives of the creditor, whom she has \ncontacted, have been unable to locate the debt. These efforts are sufficient to mitigate \nsubparagraphs 1.b and 1.f, and to trigger the application of AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(b) and 20(d). I \nresolve subparagraphs 1.b and 1.f in Applicant\u2019s favor. \nApplicant successfully established that two of the three debts alleged in \nsubparagraphs 1.c through 1.e were duplicates. However, her contention that she was \nnot responsible for their payment because her ex-husband was legally responsible to pay \nthem, per a separation agreement, was unsubstantiated absent record evidence of such \nan agreement. I conclude that AG \u00b6 20(e) is only partially applicable. \nApplicant attempted to arrange a payment plan with the IRS to satisfy her \ndelinquent business tax debts, but an agent rejected her request, explaining that at that \ntime, her finances were insufficient to begin initiating a payment plan. Under these \ncircumstances, AG \u00b6 20(g) is inapplicable. \nApplicant received financial counseling, as part of the bankruptcy proceedings. \nShe has gotten off to a good start in satisfying her debts by paying down the debt alleged \nin subparagraph 1.b. However, the most significant debt, owed to the IRS, remains \noutstanding, and per an IRS agent, she does not currently have the means to initiate a \nviable payment plan. Consequently, although Applicant deserves credit for the steps she \nhas made thus far to satisfy her delinquent debts, there is not yet a significant enough \ntrack record of financial reform to conclude that she has mitigated the financial \nconsiderations security concerns. \nWhole-Person Concept \nThe awarding of a security clearance is not a once in a life time occurrence, but is \nbased on applying the factors, both disqualifying and mitigating, as set forth in the \nDirective, to the evidence presented. Under Applicant\u2019s current circumstances, a \n6 \n\n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n_____________________ \nclearance is not recommended, but should she be afforded an opportunity to reapply for \na security clearance in the future, she may well demonstrate persuasive evidence of her \nsecurity worthiness.

She was married previously from 2003 to 2020. The marriage ended in divorce. \n(GE 1 at 25) Applicant\u2019s ex-husband has custody of the minor children. (Tr. 18) \nAfter graduating from high school, Applicant earned two associate degrees. (GE 1 \nat 14) She is a veteran of the U.S. Air Force, serving from 1993 to 2015. She retired \nhonorably.

(Tr. 23) A significant portion of their \nbusiness derived from a prime contractor who paid her to provide cleaning services on a \nlocal military base. Initially, the business was successful.

(Tr. 24) \nApplicant and her then husband consulted law firms about suing the contractor. \n(Tr. 25) However, no firm was willing to take the case, explaining that the size of the \ncontractor\u2019s company and the contractor\u2019s clout in the community would make the case \ntoo labor-intensive and expensive to litigate.

Ultimately, they became unable to pay their personal debts. (GE 2 at \n6) \nIn September 2018, Applicant and her then husband filed for Chapter 13 \nbankruptcy protection, as alleged in SOR subparagraph 1.a. Approximately $87,000 of \ndebts were included in the plan. (GE 3 at 9) As part of the bankruptcy proceeding, \nApplicant\u2019s home was sold at foreclosure. (GE 2 at 14) Also, as part of the bankruptcy \nplan, Applicant was required to attend financial counseling. (Tr. 34) Applicant had no \nfinancial problems before the business failed. \nBy late 2019, Applicant and her then husband\u2019s financial problems had begun to \nstress their marriage. (Tr. 33) In February 2020, Applicant filed for divorce. As part of their \nseparation agreement, Applicant and her then husband agreed to split the Chapter 13 \nbankruptcy payments. The divorce was finalized by December 2020. (Tr. 56) \nSubsequently, Applicant\u2019s husband reneged on the terms of the separation agreement, \nleading to the dismissal of the bankruptcy plan for failing to make the court-ordered \npayments. (GE 3 at 2; Tr. 33) \nIn addition to the bankruptcy filing, the SOR alleges that Applicant has incurred \nfive delinquent debts, as alleged in subparagraphs 1.b through 1.f, and that Applicant \nowes delinquent business tax debt, as alleged in subparagraph 1.g. Subparagraph 1.b, \ntotaling $6,640, is a credit card account. Applicant has been making $75 monthly \npayments since March 2021. (AE C \u2013 AE E) As of the date of the hearing, the outstanding \nbalance was $5,515. (GE C at 1) \nSubparagraphs 1.c through 1.e are owed to the same creditor. Subparagraphs 1.d \nand 1.e are duplicates. By September 2021, Applicant\u2019s responsibility for 1.c and 1.d, as \nalleged again in subparagraph 1.e, was terminated some time after the issuance of the \nSOR. (compare GE 4 at 4 with GE 6 at 3-5 and GE 7 at 6,8) \nThe debt alleged in subparagraph 1.f, totaling $5,379, is a credit card debt. \nApplicant has contacted representatives of the creditor approximately 20 times to arrange \na payment plan, and no one has been able to find a record that she owes it. (Tr. 41; AE \nF) \nThe debt alleged in subparagraph 1.g, totaling $45,000, is delinquent payroll taxes \nrelated to the failure of Applicant\u2019s business. (Tr. 44) Between 2016 and 2020, the IRS \napplied approximately $17,000 of refunds from Applicant\u2019s personal income tax returns \nto her business delinquency. (AE H; Tr. 45) \nIn 2021, Applicant made two payments towards the satisfaction of her tax debt, \ntotaling $390.

Her request was rejected, and the account was placed in non-collectible status \nbecause the IRS agent concluded that she did not have enough disposable income to \nexecute a payment plan at this time. (Tr. 48) \nApplicant maintains a budget. She has $243 of monthly disposable income. (AE L) \nPolicies \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion the Executive \nBranch has in regulating access to information pertaining to national security, \nemphasizing that \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy \nv. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). When evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security \nclearance, the administrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are required to be \nconsidered in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of \nhuman behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the \nadjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overall adjudicative goal is a fair, \nimpartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a \nconscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d \nThe administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the \nperson, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 1(d) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present \nevidence to establish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, \nthe applicant is responsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, \nexplain, extenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department \nCounsel. . ..\u201d The applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable \nsecurity decision. \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must consider the \ntotality of an applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant circumstances in light of the nine \nadjudicative process factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). They are as follows: \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; \n(2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation;  \n(3) the frequency and recency of the conduct;  \n(4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct;  \n(5) the extent to which participation is voluntary;  \n(6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nbehavioral changes;  \n(7) the motivation for the conduct;  \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and  \n(9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nAnalysis \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nUnder this concern, \u201cfailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to \nabide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about an individual\u2019s \nreliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified or sensitive information.\u201d (AG \u00b6 \n18)  \nApplicant\u2019s history of financial problems triggers the application of AG \u00b6 19(a), \n\u201cinability to satisfy debts\u201d and AG \u00b6 19(c), \u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations.\u201d \nHer history of delinquent federal payroll taxes triggers the application of AG \u00b6 19(f), \n\u201cfailure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income tax returns or \nfailure to pay annual Federal state, or local income tax as required.\u201d \nThe following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially applicable to the \nremaining SOR allegations: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce, or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts;  \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue; and \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority \nto file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \nApplicant\u2019s inability to pay her debts on time was not caused by foolish or profligate \nspending. Instead, it stemmed from the failure of her business and her subsequent \ndivorce. In early 2021, a few months after her divorce was finalized, Applicant began \nattempting to contact creditors, including the holder of the debt alleged in subparagraph \n1.b. She organized a payment plan with this creditor, to which she has been adhering \nsince March 2021. Moreover, she has received financial counseling, and she has dutifully \nbeen making efforts to initiate the payment of the debt alleged in subparagraph 1.f, but \nrepresentatives of the creditor, whom she has contacted, have been unable to locate the \ndebt. These efforts are sufficient to mitigate subparagraphs 1.b and 1.f, and to trigger the \napplication of AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(b) and 20(d). I resolve subparagraphs 1.b and 1.f in Applicant\u2019s \nfavor. \nApplicant successfully established that subparagraphs 1.d and 1.e are duplicates. \nAs such, I resolve subparagraph 1.e in her favor. (See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 17-01371 at \n3 (App. Bd. Nov. 16, 2018) \nApplicant contended that she was not responsible for satisfying the debts alleged \nin subparagraphs 1.c and 1.d because her ex-husband was legally responsible to pay \nthem, per a separation agreement. In my original decision, I concluded that Applicant\u2019s \ncontention was unsubstantiated. On appeal, the Appeal Board noted that two of the credit \nreports that the Government provided, ostensibly in support of the allegations in \nsubparagraphs 1.c and 1.d, actually confirm Applicant\u2019s contention that she is no longer \nresponsible for these debts. \nConsequently, upon reconsideration, I resolve these \nallegations in her favor. \nApplicant attempted to arrange a payment plan with the IRS to satisfy her \ndelinquent business tax debts, but an agent rejected her request, explaining that at that \ntime, her finances were insufficient to begin initiating a payment plan. Under these \ncircumstances, AG \u00b6 20(g) is inapplicable. \nUpon weighing the evidence again on remand, I conclude that the circumstances \nbeyond Applicant\u2019s control that led to her financial problems, together with her responsible \nbehavior in attempting to address them outweigh any negative implications related to the \nIRS\u2019 rejection of her request to implement a payment plan, and its placement of the debt \nin non-collectible status. Applicant has mitigated the financial considerations security \nconcerns. \nWhole-Person Concept \nAny security concerns posed by Applicant\u2019s financial problems are outweighed by \nthe circumstances surrounding them and her responsible behavior in addressing them. \nUnder these circumstances, her financial problems do not generate a vulnerability to \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n_____________________ \ncoercion or exploitation. Upon considering this case in the context of the whole-person \nconcept, I conclude upon reconsideration that Applicant mitigated the security concerns. \nClearance is granted. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 1.a \u2013 1.g: \n \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly \nconsistent with the interests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact The SOR alleges under Guideline E that Applicant received a letter of reprimand in February 1999 (\u00b6 1.a) and was charged with battery and fighting in public in May 2002 (\u00b6 1.c). His employment with different federal contractors was terminated in March 2001 (\u00b6 1.b), June 2013 (\u00b6 1.d), February 2015 (\u00b6 1.e), September 2018 (\u00b6 1.f), and November 2019 (\u00b6 1.g). It further alleges that he falsified his 2019 SCA when he deliberately denied and failed to disclose that he was terminated from his employment as alleged in \u00b6\u00b6 1.d, 1.e, and 1.f (\u00b6\u00b6 1.h, 1.i, and 1.j). Under Guideline K, the SOR alleges that he failed to comply with rules and regulations for handling protected information as alleged under \u00b6 1.f (\u00b6 2.a). In his answer, Applicant denied all of the factual allegations in the SOR, except for \u00b6 1.d, which he admitted with comments. Applicant\u2019s SOR admission and those at his hearing are incorporated into my findings of fact. After a thorough review of all the record evidence, I make the following additional findings of fact: Applicant, 70, graduated from a military academy in 1974. He served on active duty as an officer between 1974 and December 1979, and was honorably discharged with the rank of captain (O-3). (Tr. 9) He was granted a security clearance while in the military academy in 1971.

I marked and made AE 1 part of \nthe record, without objections. Applicant testified on his own behalf as reflected in a \ntranscript (Tr.) received by DOHA on September 14, 2022.

Applicant\u2019s SOR admission and those at his \nhearing are incorporated into my findings of fact. After a thorough review of all the record \nevidence, I make the following additional findings of fact: \nApplicant, 70, graduated from a military academy in 1974. He served on active \nduty as an officer between 1974 and December 1979, and was honorably discharged with \nthe rank of captain (O-3). (Tr. 9) He was granted a security clearance while in the military \nacademy in 1971.

He believes that he \nhas established a good reputation and is respected by peers and employers for his \nacumen and ability to resolve complicated issues within his areas of expertise. (AE A) \nApplicant received a letter of reprimand in February 1999, for unprofessional \nconduct and demonstrating poor judgment in the workplace. (SOR \u00b6 1.a) He denied he \never received the letter of reprimand. At hearing, when confronted with the letter of \nreprimand bearing his signature, he claimed he forgot about it because the incident \noccurred 23 years ago. (Tr. 47 \u2013 48; GE 4) \nApplicant denied that he was terminated from his employment with different federal \ncontractors in March 2001 (due to argumentative behavior towards his workers (SOR \u00b6 \n1.b)), June 2013 (inaccurate time cards (SOR \u00b6 1.d)), February 2015 (unprofessional \nconduct and insubordination (SOR \u00b6 1.e)), September 2018 (attempted security violations \n(SOR \u00b6 1.f)), and November 2019 (unprofessional conduct (SOR \u00b6 1.g)). \nApplicant claimed that he was never told he was terminated from any of these \nemployment positions, except for the termination alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.d. He claimed he \nwas informed that he was being laid off. He argued that he could not have been \nterminated because he was allowed to file for and received unemployment benefits from \nthe state. He contends that if he had been terminated, under state law he would have \nbeen precluded from receiving unemployment benefits. He failed to provide documentary \nevidence to show he received unemployment benefits after any of the alleged \nterminations. Documentary evidence in the record and his testimony show that he \nreceived unemployment benefits even though he was terminated from his employment in \n2013 and 2019. (GE 7; Tr. 85) \nApplicant admitted he was convicted of a misdemeanor battery charge and fighting \nin public in May 2002 (SOR \u00b6 1.c). He slapped and pushed a woman at a gas station \nwhen she approached him while screaming at him. (Tr. 28) \nConcerning SOR \u00b6 1.d, Applicant admitted that he submitted inaccurate time cards \nin violation of his company\u2019s policy. However, he denied that he submitted the inaccurate \ntime cards to defraud the Government. He claimed that he only charged for the hours he \nworked. He averred that he worked longer hours during the week, and on Fridays, he \nwould take off early. However, he submitted inaccurate time cards showing that he was \nworking eight hours every day. He submitted no documentary evidence to show that he \nasked for and received permission to submit inaccurate time cards or to work a flexible \nschedule. (Tr. 29 \u2013 31; 60 - 61) Applicant admitted that, although his employer terminated \nhis employment, he filed for and the state paid him unemployment benefits. (Tr. 61) \nApplicant testified: \nI figured it wouldn't hurt anything to cut a little time off for Friday. And let's \nface it, I'm a professional. I'm not an hourly employee. Okay?

(Tr. 31) \nApplicant admitted that in March 2014, his employer gave him a written warning \nfor viewing pornographic and dating websites using his company-issued laptop and for \nreceiving personal phone calls from recruiters during work hours, in violation of company \npolicy. (SOR \u00b6 1.e) Applicant claimed that at the time his employer issued him the phone \nand the laptop, his employer told him he could use both the computer and phone freely \nfor his personal use. He complained that his company did not inform him that it would \nmonitor his use of the equipment, and that it reneged on the promise that he could use \nthe equipment freely. (Tr. 64 \u2013 65) He admitted he visited dating sites, denied he was \nwatching pornography (although, some of the dating sites showed women in bikinis), and \nadmitted that he would get calls during duty hours from recruiters about possible job \nopportunities. (Tr. 31 \u2013 33) \nApplicant was terminated from his employment in February 2015 for \nunprofessional conduct and insubordination. (GE 7; Tr. 68) He explained that his \nsupervisor sent him a nasty email criticizing his work that was shared with others in the \ncompany. Applicant replied with a nasty email of his own, also shared with others, \ncorrecting and confronting the supervisor. (Tr. 32 - 33) The letter or termination \nspecifically informs Applicant that he was eligible to apply for unemployment \ncompensation benefits. (GE 7) \nApplicant admitted that his employer removed him from working on a contract after \nthe customer asked the employer to do so in September 2018. He denied that his \nemployer informed him of the reasons for his removal. (SOR \u00b6 1.f) Applicant denied that \nhe asked to take home classified software or to use classified software in an unclassified \ndesk environment. (Tr. 33 \u2013 38) Notwithstanding, the Defense Security Service \nSuspicions Contact Report (GE 9), indicates that Applicant\u2019s team members expressed \nconcerns about his handling of classified information several times. \nApplicant was terminated from his employment with a federal contractor because \nof unprofessional conduct in November 2019. (GE 8 \u2013 termination letter) He explained \nthat he was in the company building working late at night. A woman he did not know and \nhad not seen before approached him and spoke to him. He ignored her and walked away. \nWhen confronted, he told her that he believed she had been talking on the phone and not \nto him. He then told her that it was late, that he was going home, and walked away. The \nnext day, his employer informed him that he had been terminated. (Tr. 39 \u2013 40; GE 8) \nApplicant denied that he falsified his 2019 SCA when he answered \u201cNo\u201d to \nquestions in Section 13A-Employment Activities, and failed to disclose that he received a \nwritten warning and was terminated from his employment, as alleged in \u00b6\u00b6 1.d, 1.e, and \n1.f. (\u00b6\u00b6 1.h, 1.i, and 1.j).

The record \nevidence is insufficient to establish that Applicant failed to comply with rules and \nregulations for handling protected information. GE 9 states that Applicant \u201chas not yet \ncommitted a security violation because team members have stopped violations before \nthey occurred,\u201d and that they often have to remind him of security requirements. (GE 9) \nThe main concern stated in GE 9 \u2013 the heart of the document \u2013 appears to be \nmanagement dissatisfaction with Applicant\u2019s work performance, general behavior, self-\nmanagement skills, and lack of technical skills. All of which should have been better \nhandled under the human resources umbrella, either for the federal contractor or the \nGovernment. \nNotwithstanding, insider threat is defined as the threat that an insider will use his \nor her authorized access, wittingly or unwittingly, to do harm to the agency\u2019s mission, \nresources, personnel, facilities, information, equipment, networks, or systems. This threat \ncan manifest as damage to the agency through, among other things, as the unauthorized \ndisclosure of information. (See DOD Directive 5205.16, The DOD Insider Threat Program \n(September 30, 2014, Incorporating Change 2, August 28, 2017)) Based on the evidence \npresented, Applicant may unwittingly disclose classified information. \nApplicant noted that he has a history of over 40 years of keeping and protecting \nGovernment\u2019s secrets and not disclosing classified information. He claimed he has \nalways been very careful to protect and secure classified information. He follows \nestablished procedures and exceeds the protection standards put in place by the \nGovernment to ensure the protection of classified information. He stated that there are no \nleaks attributed to him. (Tr. 45, 86) \nApplicant highlighted his time in the service and his work for federal contractors. \nHe loves the United States and has supported this country and protected the country\u2019s \nsecrets since he was 18. He believes he should be allowed to have a clearance at any \nlevel. He also believes that he has earned a clearance and should keep it. He does not \nconsider himself an insider threat.

Or. 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended. The \nU.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the Executive Branch in \nregulating access to information pertaining to national security, emphasizing that \u201cno one \nhas a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 \n(1988). \nThe AG list disqualifying and mitigating conditions for evaluating a person\u2019s \nsuitability for access to classified information. Any one disqualifying or mitigating condition \nis not, by itself, conclusive. However, the AG should be followed where a case can be \nmeasured against them, as they represent policy guidance governing access to classified \ninformation. Each decision must reflect a fair, impartial, and commonsense consideration \nof the whole person and the factors listed in SEAD 4, App. A \u00b6\u00b6 2(d) and 2(f). All available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, must \nbe considered. \nSecurity clearance decisions resolve whether it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant or continue an applicant\u2019s security clearance. The Government \nmust prove, by substantial evidence, controverted facts alleged in the SOR. If it does, the \nburden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts. The \napplicant bears the heavy burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant or continue his or her security clearance. \nPersons with access to classified information enter into a fiduciary relationship with \nthe Government based on trust and confidence. Thus, the Government has a compelling \ninterest in ensuring each applicant possesses the requisite judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness of those who must protect national interest as their own. The \u201cclearly \nconsistent with the national interest\u201d standard compels resolution of any reasonable doubt \nabout an applicant\u2019s suitability for access in favor of the Government. \u201c[S]ecurity \nclearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. \nat 531; SEAD 4, \u00b6 E(4); SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6\u00b6 1(d) and 2(b). Clearance decisions are not \na determination of the loyalty of the applicant concerned. They are merely an indication \nthat the applicant has or has not met the strict guidelines the Government has established \nfor issuing a clearance. \nAnalysis \nGuideline E: Personal Conduct \nAG \u00b6 15 explains why personal conduct is a security concern stating: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. The following will normally result in \nan unfavorable national security eligibility determination, security clearance \naction, or cancellation of further processing for national security eligibility:   \n. . .  (b) refusal to provide full, frank, and truthful answers to lawful questions \nof investigators, security officials, or other official representatives in \nconnection with a personnel security or trustworthiness determination. \nAG \u00b6 15 sets forth the security concern as follows: \nApplicant received a letter of reprimand in February 1999 (\u00b6 1.a); he was convicted \nof a misdemeanor (battery of a woman) in May 2002 (\u00b6 1.c); and his employment with \ndifferent federal contractors was terminated in March 2001 (\u00b6 1.b), June 2013 (\u00b6 1.d), \nFebruary 2015 (\u00b6 1.e), September 2018 (\u00b6 1.f), and November 2019 (\u00b6 1.g). Moreover, \nhe falsified his 2019 SCA when he deliberately denied and failed to disclose that he was \nterminated from his employment as alleged in \u00b6\u00b6 1.d, 1.e, and 1.f (\u00b6\u00b6 1.h, 1.i, and 1.j). \nApplicant\u2019s behavior raises the following disqualifying conditions under AG \u00b6 16: \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar \nform used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, \naward benefits or status, determine national security eligibility or \ntrustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities and  \n(e) personal conduct, or concealment of information about one's \nconduct, that creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or \nduress by a foreign intelligence entity or other individual or group. Such \nconduct includes: \n(1) engaging in activities which, if known, could affect the person's \npersonal, professional, or community standing . . ..  \nThe record establishes the above disqualifying conditions, requiring additional \ninquiry about the possible applicability of the mitigating conditions. I considered the \nfollowing mitigating conditions set forth by AG \u00b6 17: \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; \n(b) the refusal or failure to cooperate, omission, or concealment was caused \nor significantly contributed to by advice of legal counsel or of a person with \nprofessional responsibilities for advising or instructing the individual \nspecifically concerning security processes. Upon being made aware of the \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nrequirement to cooperate or provide the information, the individual \ncooperated fully and truthfully; \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, \nunreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to \nrecur; \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate vulnerability \nto exploitation, manipulation, or duress; and  \n(f) the information was unsubstantiated or from a source of questionable \nreliability. \nThe DOHA Appeal Board concisely explained Applicant\u2019s responsibility for proving \nthe applicability of mitigating conditions as follows: \nOnce a concern arises regarding an Applicant\u2019s security clearance \neligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance of \na security clearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th \nCir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991). After the Government \npresents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the \napplicant to rebut or mitigate those concerns. See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. The \nstandard applicable in security clearance decisions is that articulated in \nEgan, supra. \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access \nto classified information will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nDirective, Enclosure 2 \u00b6 2(b).  \nISCR Case No. 10-04641 at 4 (App. Bd. Sept. 24, 2013). \nNone of the mitigating conditions are applicable. Applicant\u2019s personal conduct and \nmisconduct occurred frequently, it is recent, and it is likely to recur. His personal conduct \ncast doubts on his current reliability, trustworthiness, and judgment. Personal conduct \nsecurity concerns are not mitigated. \nThe SOR alleged under Guideline K that Applicant failed to comply with rules and \nregulations for handling protected information as alleged under \u00b6 1.f (\u00b6 2.a). The record \nevidence is insufficient to establish that Applicant failed to comply with rules and \nregulations for handling protected information. Notwithstanding, based on the evidence, \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n         \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant may unwittingly disclose classified information. I find the Guideline K allegation \nagainst Applicant. \nWhole-Person Concept \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case, and under the whole-person concept. AG \n\u00b6\u00b6 2(a) and 2(d). I have incorporated my comments under Guidelines E and K in my \nwhole-person analysis. Some of these factors were addressed under those guidelines, \nbut some warrant additional comment. \nApplicant, 70, is a service academy graduate. He served almost six years on active \nduty as an officer and received an honorable discharge. He was first granted clearance \neligibility back in 1971. His eligibility has been continued throughout his many years of \nwork for federal contractors. He has been working for federal contractors since 1981. \nApplicant attested to his own professionalism, skills, and knowledge. He noted that \nhe loves the United States and would not compromise the safety of this nation. He \nbelieves he should be allowed to have a clearance at any level. He believes that he has \nearned his eligibility for a clearance and should keep it. He does not consider himself an \ninsider threat. \nNevertheless, Applicant\u2019s evidence is insufficient to mitigate the serious security \nconcerns raised by his deliberate falsification of his 2019 SCA and his frequent and recent \nmisconduct. His overall pattern of poor judgment over more than 20 years shows a lack \nof reliability and trustworthiness. It is well settled that once a concern arises regarding an \napplicant\u2019s security clearance eligibility, there is a strong presumption against granting a \nsecurity clearance. See Dorfmont, 913 F. 2d at 1401. Unmitigated personal conduct \nsecurity concerns lead me to conclude that grant of a security clearance to Applicant is \nnot warranted at this time. \nI have carefully applied the law, as set forth in Egan, Exec. Or. 10865, the Directive, \nand the AGs, to the facts and circumstances in the context of the whole person. Personal \nconduct security concerns are not mitigated. Clearance is denied. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline E:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.j: \nAgainst Applicant \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n____________________________ \nParagraph 2, Guideline K:   \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 2.a: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national security interests of the United States to grant \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance.

(Tr. 24-32) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility, the administrative judge \nmust consider the AG. In addition to brief introductory explanations for each guideline, \nthe adjudicative guidelines list potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating \nconditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified \ninformation. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere \nspeculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 states an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for financial considerations is set out \nin AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nAG \u00b6 19 provides conditions that could raise security concerns. The following are \npotentially applicable: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant had seven delinquent debts totaling approximately $33,848 that began \naccumulating in 2018. There is sufficient evidence to support the application of the above \ndisqualifying conditions. \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising \nfrom financial difficulties. The following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially \napplicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n4 \n\n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; and \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nApplicant attributed his delinquent debts to being laid off from his job in 2018 and \nthen being underemployed. When he began his new job in April 2019, he contacted DR \nto help him resolve his debts. He made consistent payments into a dedicated account \nused to settle his debts. He then took a loan to repay the remaining two debts and \ncontinues to make consistent payments on the loan. Applicant\u2019s financial difficulties are \nunlikely to recur and do not cast doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness or good \njudgment. His unemployment and underemployment were beyond his control. Once he \nwas gainfully employed, he began resolving his debts. He acted responsibly under the \ncircumstances. He has repaid the debts he owed. Although, he has not participated in \nfinancial counseling, he has learned lessons and there are clear indications that his \nfinancial issues are resolved. All of the above mitigating conditions apply. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline F in my whole-person analysis. \nApplicant met his burden of persuasion. He has established a reliable financial \ntrack record. The record evidence leaves me with no questions or doubts as to Applicant\u2019s \neligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For these reasons, I conclude Applicant \nmitigated the security concerns arising under Guideline F, financial considerations. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.g: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly \nconsistent with the national security to grant Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance. \nEligibility for access to classified information is granted. \nCarol G.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact The SOR alleges six delinquent accounts totaling almost $97,000. The accounts include a mortgage, a personal loan, two installment loans, and two credit card accounts. Applicant admitted all the accounts except for SOR \u00b6 1.c. His primary reason for the overdue debts was his sudden loss of employment for 11 months beginning in July 2019. (Tr. 33-34) Applicant is 55 years old. He has owned his own home since 2005. His first marriage ended in divorce in July 2004; his second marriage came to an end in November 2015. He has three adult-aged children, 26, 26, and 23.

He indicated that he repaid his mother within a year. In September 2019, Applicant \nused $18,000 of a second $22,000 loan from his mother to bring the mortgage current. The \nrecord does not reveal whether Applicant repaid the $22,000 loan to his mother. Although he did \nnot explain why he made three attempts to \u201cto recover and reestablish\u201d his mortgage loan, it \nappears that Applicant tried three times to modify his home mortgage loan. However, his \napplications were rejected because the mortgage company was dissatisfied with the documents \nhe presented them. The mortgage company also wanted him to change his future method of \npayments to wire transfers, which were too costly. (GE 3 at 3; GE 4 at 3; Tr. 30-31, 40, 46-48, \n55-56) \nApplicant did not explain why he needed his mother\u2019s help in 2018 to keep the SOR \u00b6 \n1.a mortgage current.

(GE 4 at 5; Tr. 59) This account is resolved. \nSOR \u00b6 1.c \u2013 This installment account was opened in 2018, and became delinquent in \nJune 2020. Applicant indicated that he called the creditor who replied they had no record of the \naccount. It was recommended that Applicant file an identity theft report. At hearing, Applicant \nrepeated his claim of having no knowledge of the account, but provided no documentation that \nshows he is not responsible for the account. (GE 3 at 7; GE 4 at 5; Tr. 57-58; May 2021 answer \nto SOR) The account is unresolved. \nSOR \u00b6 1.d \u2013 This is a credit-card account that opened in 2013. The account became \ndelinquent in July 2020. Applicant was sent a payoff offer from the creditor that he is unable to \npay. (GE 4 at 5; Tr. 59) The debt is not paid. \nSOR \u00b6 1.e \u2013 This is a credit-card account that was opened in 2016, and became \ndelinquent in July 2020. The credit bureau reports indicate the account was paid off in August \n2020.

(GE 4 at 5; Tr. 58; May 2021 answer to SOR) The debt has not been \nsatisfied. \nApplicant was asked what he has done to resolve the delinquent debts since his August \n2020 PSI. (GE 2) He replied that he paid off his federal and state tax debt. He considered his \nrecent discovery that he was able to borrow money as a sign that he was recovering from his \nfinancial problems. He was so confident that his other outstanding accounts were being \nmaintained sufficiently that he purchased another car during the weekend before the hearing. \nHowever, he realizes that he needs to sell one or more of his four cars. (Tr. 44, 50-53, 56, 61) \nApplicant has never had financial counseling. However, he does not believe that is the \ncause of his financial troubles. He considers the reasons to be: (1) not having money; and (2) \nbeing out of a job for 11 months between July 2019 and June 2020. Though Applicant indicated \nhe would be able to submit post-hearing documentation concerning the resolution of his taxes \nand other debts within the time allowed, I received no documentation from him. \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the administrative \njudge must consider the adjudicative guidelines.

The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the \nperson, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. The protection of the \nnational security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(d) requires that \u201c[a]ny doubt \nconcerning personnel being considered for national security eligibility will be resolved in favor of \nthe national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is responsible \nfor presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts \nadmitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . ..\u201d The applicant has the ultimate \nburden of persuasion in seeking a favorable security decision. \nAnalysis \nFinancial Considerations \nThe security concerns of the guideline for financial considerations are set forth in AG \u00b6 \n18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial obligations \nmay indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to abide by \nrules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about an individual's \nreliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified or sensitive \ninformation. Financial distress can also be caused or exacerbated by, and thus \ncan be a possible indicator of, other issues of personnel security concern such \nas excessive gambling, mental health conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol \nabuse or dependence. An individual who is financially overextended is at \ngreater risk of having to engage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to \ngenerate funds. Affluence that cannot be explained by known sources of \nincome is also a security concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, \nincluding espionage. \nAG \u00b619 describes conditions that could raise security concerns and may be \ndisqualifying: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts;  \n(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \n(e) consistent spending beyond one\u2019s means or frivolous or irresponsible \nspending, which may be indicated by excessive indebtedness, significant \nnegative cash flow, a history of late payments or of non-payment, or other \nfinancial indicators.  \nThe Government\u2019s August 2020 and May 2022 credit reports, Applicant\u2019s May 2021 \nanswer to the SOR, and the record establish the Government\u2019s case under the guideline for \nfinancial considerations.

AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a), 19(b), and 19(c) apply to Applicant\u2019s inability to \nresolve SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.c, 1.d, and 1.f. AG \u00b6 19(f) captures Applicant\u2019s frivolous spending on \nluxury items when his earnings should have been used to pay the debts listed in the SOR. \nThe pertinent mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 include: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under \nsuch circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the \nindividual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the \nperson's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected \nmedical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear victimization by \npredatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the individual acted \nresponsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control;  \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the past-\ndue debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented proof to \nsubstantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions to resolve \nthe issue. \nAG \u00b6 20(a) does not apply. Though the listed debts did not become delinquent until \nJune or July 2020, the debts were incurred under circumstances that are likely to recur, casting \ndoubt on Applicant\u2019s reliability and judgment. He still owes more than $89,000 to four listed \ncreditors. Applicant receives some mitigation under the first prong of AG \u00b6 20(b) because of \nseveral short periods of unemployment followed by 11 months of unemployment from July 2019 \nto June 2020. He receives limited mitigation under the second prong of AG \u00b6 20(b) because he \ntook action on SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b and 1.e leading to the repayment of both debts. Overall, Applicant \nreceives limited mitigation under AG \u00b6 20(b). \nAG \u00b6 20(c) applies when there is evidence of financial counseling and there are clear \nindications the problem is being resolved or under control. Applicant has never had financial \ncounseling and has demonstrated little insight on whether he knows how to manage his money \nprudently. When asked to explain why he needed an $11,000 loan from his mother in July 2018 \n(while he was working) to bring the SOR \u00b6 1.a mortgage current, his reply was that he did not \nknow, but that he played as hard as he worked. While there was more justification for the \nsecond loan of $18,000 from his mother in 2019 to cover the delinquent mortgage, because of \nhis extended unemployment, Applicant\u2019s earlier frivolous spending on luxury items like a boat, \ntwo jet skis, a four-wheeler, additional cars, and a replica tractor collection, clearly hampered his \nability to address the listed debts responsibly. AG \u00b6 20(c) has limited application to the \ncircumstances of this case because Applicant has not shown that all the delinquent debts are \nbeing resolved or under control. \n5 \n\n \n   \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(d) applies to Applicant\u2019s successful resolution of SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b and 1.e. He still \nowes $51,576 for the SOR \u00b6 1.a mortgage and has no plan to resolve the mortgage without \nloans from his mother. In addition, he still owes for the debts identified at SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1c, 1.d, and \n1.f. Overall, Applicant is allocated limited mitigation under AG \u00b6 20\n \n(d).  \nAG \u00b6 20(e) is available for mitigation when: (1) the individual has a reasonable basis \nfor the dispute; and (2) provides documented proof to substantiate the dispute of the SOR \u00b6 1.c \ndebt. It appears that Applicant may have a reasonable basis for the dispute. But, his \nuncorroborated claims of identity theft are insufficient to establish the mitigating condition until \nhe furnishes independent proof that extinguishes his responsibility for the SOR \u00b6 1(c) debt. \nWithout documented evidence, the mitigating condition is inapplicable. \nWhole-Person C\n oncept \nI have examined the evidence under the specific guideline (financial considerations) in \nthe context of the nine general factors of the whole-person concept listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances \nsurrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the \nfrequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at \nthe time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which participation is voluntary; (6) the \npresence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral \nchanges; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, \ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or \nrecurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for access to \nclassified information must be an overall common-sense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nApplicant is 55 years old and divorced with three adult-aged children. He has owned \nhis home since 2009. He served in the U.S. Navy for 24 years. He has held a security clearance \nsince at least April 2010. \nI have considered Applicant\u2019s periodic unemployment, specifically his unemployment \nbetween July 2019 and June 2020, when the listed accounts became delinquent. However, \nApplicant\u2019s financial problems began in the summer of 2018 when he obtained his first loan of \n$11,000 from his mother to bring the SOR \u00b6 1.a mortgage current. Surprisingly, he was unable \nto explain why he needed the loan until he listed the luxury items and cars he owned. The \nspendthrift habits of Applicant, coupled with the absence of financial counseling, provide the two \npersuasive reasons why he is not in control of his financial obligations. Judging by the totality of \nthe evidence, Applicant has not mitigated the guideline for financial considerations. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n6 \n\n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n______________ \nSubparagraphs 1.a, 1.c, 1.d, 1.f: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.b, 1.e:  \n \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not clearly \nconsistent with the national security interests of the United States to grant Applicant eligibility for \naccess to classified information.

Department Counsel provided a six-page summary of the \nfacts, supported by eleven Government documents pertaining to South Korea, identified \nas HE I. The documents provide elaboration and context for the summary. I take \nadministrative notice of the facts included in the U.S. Government reports. They are \nlimited to matters of general knowledge, not subject to reasonable dispute. They are set \nout in the Findings of Fact. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant admitted to the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b, and 1.g. He denied SOR \nallegations \u00b6\u00b6 1.c~1.f. After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings, exhibits, \nand testimony, I make the following findings of fact. \nApplicant is a 78-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has been \nemployed with the defense contractor, in a \u201ccasual on call . . . status\u201d since 2016. He is \nnot married. (TR at page 20 lines 1~15, and GX 1 at page 5.) \nGuideline B - Foreign Influence  \n1.a. and 1.g. Applicant has lived in South Korea since 1979, working for various \nU.S. Government organizations and U.S. defense contractors. (TR at page 18 line 2 to \npage 20 line 7, and AppX G.) Applicant\u2019s \u201clive-in girlfriend\u201d is a citizen and resident of \nSouth Korea. They have cohabitated in her apartment since about 2018. She is retired \nafter having worked for the U.S. Government. (TR at page 44 lines 10~20, and AppX A.) \n1.b. Applicant has one friend who is a citizen and resident of South Korea. He \nworks for the United States Forces Korea (USFK). Applicant had another friend who is a \ncitizen and resident of South Korea. This past-friend got involved in receiving \n\u201ckickbacks\u201d from contractors, but Applicant has had no contact with this past-friend \nsince about 2013, for nearly a decade. (TR at page 35 line 13 to page 38 line 9, at page \n42 lines 5~14, at page 44 line 21 to page 45 line 17, and AppX B.) \n1.c. Applicant no longer owns an apartment in South Korea. He sold it and now \nlives with his Korean girlfriend, as noted above. (TR at page 45 lines 18~21, and AppX\nC.) \n \n1.d.~1.f. Applicant has no bank accounts in South Korea.

South Korean government espionage and collection activities \nhave resulted in U.S. criminal prosecutions. South Korea has also been the \nunauthorized recipient of technology controlled under U.S. export laws. Finally, \nindustrial espionage remains a high-profile concern relating to South Korea and South \nKorean companies. (GX I.) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious \nscrutiny of a number of variables known as the whole-person concept. The \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d \nA person who applies for access to classified information seeks to enter into a \nfiduciary relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \nSection 7 of Executive Order (EO) 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall \nbe \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the \nloyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple \nprerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information).   \nAnalysis \nGuideline B - Foreign Influence \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Foreign Influence is set out in \nAG \u00b6 6: \nForeign contacts and interests, including, but not limited to, business, \nfinancial, and property interests, are a national security concern if they \nresult in divided allegiance. They may also be a national security concern \nif they create circumstances in which the individual may be manipulated or \ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a \nway inconsistent with U.S. interests or otherwise made vulnerable to \npressure or coercion by any foreign interest. Assessment of foreign \ncontacts and interests should consider the country in which the foreign \ncontact or interest is located, including, but not limited to, considerations \nsuch as whether it is known to target U.S. citizens to obtain classified or \nsensitive information or is associated with a risk of terrorism. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 7. Four are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) contact, regardless of method, with a foreign family member, business \nor professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or \nresident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of \nforeign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual's obligation to \nprotect classified or sensitive information or technology and the \nindividual's desire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing \nthat information or technology; \n(e) shared living quarters with a person or persons, regardless of \ncitizenship status, if that relationship creates a heightened risk of foreign \ninducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; and \n(f) substantial business, financial, or property interests in a foreign country, \nor in any foreign owned or foreign-operated business that could subject \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nthe individual to a heightened risk of foreign influence or exploitation or \npersonal conflict of interest. \nApplicant lives with his Korean girlfriend. He also had contacts with a Korean \nwho was taking kickbacks as an unauthorized aspect of his employment. The evidence \nis sufficient to raise these disqualifying conditions. \nAG \u00b6 8 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. I considered all \nof the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 8 including: \n(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in \nwhich these persons are located, or the positions or activities of those \npersons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be \nplaced in a position of having to choose between the interests of a foreign \nindividual, group, organization, or government and the interests of the \nUnited States; \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of\nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, or allegiance to the group, \ngovernment, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such deep and \nlongstanding relationships and loyalties in the United States, that the \nindividual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the \nU.S. interest; \n \n(c) contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and \ninfrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign \ninfluence or exploitation; and \n(f) the value or routine nature of the foreign business, financial, or property \ninterests is such that they are unlikely to result in a conflict and could not \nbe used effectively to influence, manipulate, or pressure the individual. \nApplicant\u2019s retired, live-in girlfriend, who worked for the U.S. Government, \npossesses no threat to national security. One friend works for USFK, and the other \nApplicant has not seen for nearly a decade. Applicant has little financial interest in \nSouth Korea, apart from his part-time employment with a U.S. contractor. Foreign \nInfluence is found for Applicant. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline B in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were \naddressed under those guidelines, but some warrant additional comment. Overall, the \nrecord evidence leaves me without questions or doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and \nsuitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant mitigated \nthe Foreign Influence security concern. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline B:  \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a~1.g: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant national security eligibility \nand a security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \nRichard A. Cefola \nAdministrative Judge \n6 \n",

He presented \nsufficient evidence to mitigate his history of financial problems. He did not intentionally \nor deliberately provide false information on a security clearance application. \nAccordingly, this case is decided for Applicant. \nStatement of the Case \nApplicant completed and submitted a Standard Form (SF) 86, Questionnaire for \nNational Security Positions, the official form used for personnel security investigations, \nin May 2020. (Exhibit 3) The automated version of the SF 86 is the e-QIP. The SF 86 is \ncommonly known as a security clearance application. \nApplicant was interviewed during the course of a 2020 background investigation. \n(Exhibit 4) Thereafter, on December 7, 2020, after reviewing the available information, \nthe DoD Consolidated Adjudications Facility, Fort Meade, Maryland, sent Applicant a \nstatement of reasons (SOR), explaining it was unable to find that it was clearly \n1 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                          \n \n \n  \n \nconsistent with the national interest to grant him eligibility for access to classified \ninformation.  \nThe SOR is similar in form and purpose to a complaint, which is the initial \npleading that starts a civil action; in some states this pleading is known as a petition; \nand in criminal law it is a formal charge accusing a person of an offense. Here, the SOR \ndetailed the factual reasons for the action under the security guidelines known as \nGuideline F for financial considerations and Guideline E for personal conduct. \nApplicant answered the SOR in June 2021. Note, an applicant\u2019s answer must be \nreceived by DOHA within 20 days of receipt of the SOR.1 His answers were mixed with \nadmissions, denials, and explanations. In addition, he provided three documents \nrelevant to the SOR allegations, and they are referred to as Attachments 1, 2, and 3. He \nrequested a clearance decision based on the written record in lieu of a hearing. \nOn November 24, 2021, Department Counsel submitted a file of relevant material \n(FORM). It consists of Department Counsel\u2019s written brief and supporting \ndocumentation. The FORM was mailed to Applicant on December 23, 2021; he \nreceived it on January 11, 2022.

In addition, \nupon confrontation, he did not recall six other delinquent accounts, five of which are \nalleged in the SOR (the sixth being a paid collection account with a $0 balance). (Exhibit \n4) He explained his lack of recall is why he did not disclose the delinquent debts when \nhe completed his security clearance application. He also noted that he agreed with the \nindebtedness because he had no reason to dispute or think the information was \ninaccurate.  \n \nThe allegation in SOR \u00b6 1.a concerns a $9,862 charged-off account. The June \n2020 credit report shows it was an individual credit card account charged off in \nDecember 2017. In his answer, Applicant denied the allegation on the basis that he \nsettled it.

In \nhis answer, Applicant admitted the debt and stated that he tried to settle the matter, but \nthe creditor sent him an IRS Form 1099-C due to cancellation of the debt, which means \nthe sum becomes taxable to him and required to be reported in the relevant federal \nincome tax return. He did not present a copy of the Form 1099-C. \nThe allegation in SOR \u00b6 1.e concerns a $2,607 charged-off account. The June \n2020 credit report shows it was an individual credit card account charged off in April \n2018. In his answer, Applicant denied the allegation on the basis the account no longer \nhad a balance due. He also presented correspondence from the creditor acknowledging \nreceipt of final payment on the account and that no further payments were required as \nof June 2021, which was after the SOR was issued. Answer at Attachment 3. \nThe allegation in SOR \u00b6 1.f concerns a $1,966 collection account. The June 2020 \ncredit report shows it was an individual account referred to a collection attorney.

(Exhibit 5)  \nLaw and Policies \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (E.O.) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of \nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review \nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the National Security \nAdjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information or \nEligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position (AG), effective June 8, 2017. \nIt is well-established law that no one has a right to a security clearance.2 As \nnoted by the Supreme Court in Department of the Navy v. Egan, \u201cthe clearly consistent \nstandard indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the \nside of denials.\u201d3 Under Egan, Executive Order 10865, and the Directive, any doubt \nabout whether an applicant should be allowed access to classified information will be \nresolved in favor of protecting national security. In Egan, the Supreme Court stated that \nthe burden of proof is less than a preponderance of evidence.4 \nThe DOHA Appeal Board has followed the Court\u2019s reasoning, and a judge\u2019s \nfindings of fact are reviewed under the substantial-evidence standard.5  Substantial \nevidence means \u201cevidence that a reasonable mind could accept as adequate to support \na conclusion; evidence beyond a scintilla.\u201d6  Substantial evidence is a lesser burden than \nboth clear and convincing evidence and preponderance of the evidence, the latter of \nwhich is the standard applied in most civil trials. It is also a far lesser burden than \nevidence beyond a reasonable doubt, the norm for criminal trials.   \nThere is no presumption in favor of granting, renewing, or continuing eligibility for \naccess to classified information.7 Under the Directive, the parties have the following \nburdens: (1) Department Counsel has the burden of presenting evidence to establish \nfacts alleged in the SOR that have been controverted; (2) an applicant is responsible for \npresenting evidence to refute, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts that have been \n2  Department of the Navy v.

The concern is stated fully in AG \u00b6 15. \nIn analyzing the facts of this case, I have considered the following disqualifying \ncondition as most pertinent: \nAG \u00b6 16(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant \nfacts from any personnel security questionnaire, personal history \nstatement, or similar form used to conduct investigations, determine \nemployment qualifications, award benefits or status, determine national \nsecurity eligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities. \nApplicant disclosed a single delinquent debt when completing his security \nclearance application. He incorrectly reported it as an unpaid judgment when it was an \nunresolved charged-off account. He did not disclose five other delinquent accounts, as \nalleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b through 1.f. He should have. He denied doing so intentionally, \nand he explained he failed to do so due to a lack of recall. His explanation is \nreasonable, especially given his disclosure of the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.a. Given the record \nevidence before me, I am not persuaded that his nondisclosure was a deliberate or \nintentional omission, concealment, or falsification of his derogatory financial history. \nAccordingly, the Guideline E matter is decided for Applicant. \nUnder Guideline F for financial considerations, the suitability of an applicant may \nbe questioned or put into doubt when that applicant has a history of excessive \nindebtedness or financial problems or difficulties. The overall concern is set forth in AG \n\u00b6 18 as follows: \nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. . .. \nThe concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified or sensitive information to obtain money or something else of \nvalue. It encompasses concerns about a person\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other \nimportant qualities. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \n8 Directive, Enclosure 3, \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.14 and E3.1.15. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n   \n \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified or sensitive \ninformation. \nIn analyzing the facts of this case, I considered the following disqualifying \nconditions as most pertinent: \nAG \u00b6 19(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \nAG \u00b6 19(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nThe evidence supports a conclusion that Applicant has a history of financial \nproblems that is sufficient to raise a security concern under Guideline F. The \ndisqualifying conditions noted above apply here. \nThe evidence shows Applicant has made progress in resolving his past financial \ndelinquencies. The $5,128 collection account in SOR \u00b6 1.c is unresolved, although he \nnoted he was working on paying it. The other five delinquent accounts are resolved or in \nthe process of being resolved. The $9,862 charged-off account in SOR \u00b6 1.a was \nresolved in September 2020 when it was settled in full. The $7,609 collection account in \nSOR \u00b6 1.b was resolved in November 2020 when the plaintiff/creditor dismissed a \ncollection lawsuit with prejudice. Although that action is not direct evidence of payment, \nit is direct evidence that the plaintiff/creditor was satisfied to the point where they ended \nterminated their lawsuit. The $2,818 charged-off account in SOR \u00b6 1.d was resolved \nwhen the creditor cancelled the debt and provided Applicant an IRS Form 1099-C for \ntax purposes. Although he did not present a copy of the Form 1099, his explanation is \ncredible, as it would be unusual for an applicant to say they received a Form 1099 if that \nwas not case. The $2,607 charged-off account in SOR \u00b6 1.e was resolved in about June \n2021 when he made the final payment. And the $1,966 collection account in SOR \u00b6 1.f \nis in the process of being resolved per a garnishment order initiated in about May 2021, \nnearly one year ago. Granted, payments per a garnishment order are not voluntary. So \nwhile he does not receive full credit in mitigation for the garnishment action, he does \ndeserve a bit of credit; after all, he\u2019s earning the money. It is also likely that this debt has \nbeen repaid by now, but that is too speculative to rely on without supporting \ndocumentation. \nApplicant did not present a perfect case in mitigation. He could have done a \nbetter job documenting his case (e.g., the missing IRS Form 1099-C). Nevertheless, \ntaking the evidence as a whole, he presented sufficient evidence to show that he is \ntaking reasonable steps to make a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \notherwise resolve debts within the meaning of the mitigating condition at AG \u00b6 20(d). \nFollowing Egan and the clearly consistent standard, I have no doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, good judgment, and ability to protect classified or \nsensitive information. In reaching this conclusion, I weighed the evidence as a whole \nand considered if the favorable evidence outweighed the unfavorable evidence or vice \nversa. I also considered the whole-person concept.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact The SOR alleges seven delinquent medical accounts, totaling $1,159 (\u00b6\u00b6 1.a \u2013 1.g); a delinquent credit card account, totaling $296 (\u00b6 1.h); a charged-off communications services account, totaling $1,134 (\u00b6 1.i); and six U.S. Department of Education (DOE) student loans in collection, totaling over $32,125 (\u00b6\u00b6 1.j \u2013 1.o). Her student loans were assigned to collections in 2014 and 2015. In her answers to the SOR, Applicant denied the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a \u2013 1.h, because she had either paid or settled the accounts. She admitted the remaining SOR allegations. (\u00b6\u00b6 1.i \u2013 1.o) Her admissions are incorporated into my findings of fact. After a thorough review of the record evidence, I make the following additional findings of fact: Applicant is 36 years old. She graduated from high school in 2005, and attended college during three periods: August 2005 to July 2006; August 2007 to August 2009; and January 2014 to May 2016. She is still working on earning a college degree. She has been using student loans to pay for her education. She married in October 2012 and divorced in October 2017. She has two children, a son, age 13, and a daughter, age six. Applicant\u2019s employment history indicates she worked for two federal contractors between April 2009 and April 2014. She stated that the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) granted her eligibility for access to secret information during part of that employment period.

Applicant was informed that her failure to respond to the FORM or to raise \nany objections could be construed as a waiver and the proposed FORM evidence \nwould be considered. Applicant did not respond to the FORM. Without objections, I \nadmitted and considered all of the FORM\u2019s proffered evidence. \nFindings of Fact \nThe SOR alleges seven delinquent medical accounts, totaling $1,159 (\u00b6\u00b6 1.a \u2013 \n1.g); a delinquent credit card account, totaling $296 (\u00b6 1.h); a charged-off \ncommunications services account, totaling $1,134 (\u00b6 1.i); and six U.S. Department of \nEducation (DOE) student loans in collection, totaling over $32,125 (\u00b6\u00b6 1.j \u2013 1.o). Her \nstudent loans were assigned to collections in 2014 and 2015. \nIn her answers to the SOR, Applicant denied the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a \u2013 1.h, \nbecause she had either paid or settled the accounts. She admitted the remaining SOR \nallegations. (\u00b6\u00b6 1.i \u2013 1.o) Her admissions are incorporated into my findings of fact. After \na thorough review of the record evidence, I make the following additional findings of \nfact: \nApplicant is 36 years old. She graduated from high school in 2005, and attended \ncollege during three periods: August 2005 to July 2006; August 2007 to August 2009; \nand January 2014 to May 2016. She is still working on earning a college degree. She \nhas been using student loans to pay for her education. She married in October 2012 \nand divorced in October 2017. She has two children, a son, age 13, and a daughter, \nage six. \nApplicant\u2019s employment history indicates she worked for two federal contractors \nbetween April 2009 and April 2014. She stated that the Office of Personnel \nManagement (OPM) granted her eligibility for access to secret information during part of \nthat employment period. She was unemployed between April 2014 and May 2016; \nworked as a bartender between May 2016 and February 2017; and was unemployed \nbetween February 2017 and September 2017.

She was self-employed between \nDecember 2017 and January 2020, working at a greenhouse and landscaping business. \nHer current employer and security sponsor, a federal contractor, hired her in January \n2020. \nIn Section 26 (Financial Record) of her 2020 SCA, Applicant revealed that she \nwas having financial problems and disclosed some of the accounts alleged in the SOR. \nShe attributed her financial problems to her 2017 divorce, her periods of unemployment \nand underemployment, and being the sole provider for her children. \nAn OPM investigator interviewed Applicant in April 2020. At the time, she was \nunderemployed, doing part-time work for a greenhouse. She told the investigator that \nshe was unable to pay her debts while separated from her ex-husband and after her \ndivorce, because she was unemployed or underemployed. She prioritized her bill \npayments to pay for living necessities and the children\u2019s needs. She promised the \ninvestigator she would start paying her debts when she starts her full-time job. She \nstated that she was willing to pay her debts, but she did not have the earnings to do so. \nConcerning her student loan debt, she noted that the IRS withheld her 2018 tax refund \nand applied it to her student loan debt. (Item 8) \nApplicant\u2019s documentary evidence shows that she paid the accounts alleged in \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, and 1.d through 1.g, on December 11, 2020. (Encl. 2) She did not present \ndirect documentary evidence that she paid the accounts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b and 1.c, \nbut her December 2020 Experian credit report shows \u201c0\u201d accounts in collection. \nConsidering that she paid her other medical accounts during that same period, I find \nthese two accounts are resolved. (Encl. 4) \nApplicant paid SOR \u00b6 1.h on December 11, 2020. (Encl. 1) She made one \npayment of $52 to the collector of the account alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.i. It is not clear \nwhether she entered into a payment agreement to resolve the account. Concerning her \nstudent loan debt, in June 2021, Applicant entered into a payment agreement with the \nDOE to start the process to rehabilitate her student loans. (Encl. 5; FORM, Item 3) \nApplicant failed to submit documentary evidence about her efforts to contact \ncreditors, of any payment agreements established, of any payments made to her \ncreditors before she received the SOR on December 4, 2020. She presented no \nevidence to show she has participated in financial counseling or has a working budget. \nShe did not present evidence of her current financial situation (gross monthly income, \ndeductions, monthly expenses, and monthly net remainder). Without any documentary \nevidence of her current financial situation, it is not possible for me to assess whether \nshe is financially overextended. \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nPolicies \nThe SOR was issued under Executive Order (Exec.

Or. 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended. \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the Executive \nBranch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security, emphasizing \nthat \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 \nU.S. 518, 528 (1988). \nThe AGs list disqualifying and mitigating conditions for evaluating a person\u2019s \nsuitability for access to classified information. Any one disqualifying or mitigating \ncondition is not, by itself, conclusive. However, the AGs should be followed where a \ncase can be measured against them, as they represent policy guidance governing \naccess to classified information. Each decision must reflect a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense consideration of the whole person and the factors listed in SEAD 4, App. \nA \u00b6\u00b6 2(d) and 2(f). All available, reliable information about the person, past and present, \nfavorable and unfavorable, must be considered. \nSecurity clearance decisions resolve whether it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant or continue an applicant\u2019s security clearance. The Government \nmust prove, by substantial evidence, controverted facts alleged in the SOR. If it does, \nthe burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts. The \napplicant bears the heavy burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant or continue his or her security clearance. \nPersons with access to classified information enter into a fiduciary relationship \nwith the Government based on trust and confidence. Thus, the Government has a \ncompelling interest in ensuring each applicant possesses the requisite judgment, \nreliability, and trustworthiness of those who must protect national interest as their own. \nThe \u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d standard compels resolution of any \nreasonable doubt about an applicant\u2019s suitability for access in favor of the Government. \n\u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d \nEgan, 484 U.S. at 531; SEAD 4, \u00b6 E(4); SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6\u00b6 1(d) and 2(b). Clearance \ndecisions are not a determination of the loyalty of the applicant concerned. They are \nmerely an indication that the applicant has or has not met the strict guidelines the \nGovernment has established for issuing a clearance. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAnalysis \nFinancial Considerations \nAG \u00b6 18 articulates the security concern relating to financial problems: \nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds . . ..  \nApplicant\u2019s financial problems are documented in the record. As alleged in the \nSOR, she accumulated seven delinquent medical accounts, totaling $1,159 (\u00b6\u00b6 1.a \u2013 \n1.g); a delinquent credit card account, totaling $296 (\u00b6 1.h); a charged-off \ncommunications services account, totaling $1,134 (\u00b6 1.i); and six DOE student loans in \ncollection, totaling over $32,125 (\u00b6\u00b6 1.j \u2013 1.o). She presented no documentary evidence \nof any good-faith efforts on her part to pay, settle, or resolve her delinquent debts before \nreceipt of the SOR. \nAG \u00b6 19 provides disqualifying conditions that could raise a security concern and \nmay be disqualifying in this case: \u201c(a) inability to satisfy debts;\u201d and \u201c(c) a history of not \nmeeting financial obligations.\u201d The record established these disqualifying conditions, \nrequiring additional inquiry about the possible applicability of mitigating conditions. \nThe following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control; and \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nThe DOHA Appeal Board concisely explained Applicant\u2019s responsibility for \nproving the applicability of mitigating conditions as follows: \nOnce a concern arises regarding an Applicant\u2019s security clearance \neligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance \nof a security clearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th \nCir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991). After the Government \npresents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the \napplicant to rebut or mitigate those concerns. See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. The \nstandard applicable in security clearance decisions is that articulated in \nEgan, supra. \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for \naccess to classified information will be resolved in favor of the national \nsecurity.\u201d Directive, Enclosure 2 \u00b6 2(b).  \nISCR Case No. 10-04641 at 4 (App. Bd. Sept. 24, 2013). \nApplicant\u2019s financial problems could be attributed, in part, to circumstances \nbeyond her control, i.e., her divorce, and the periods of unemployment and \nunderemployment. She explained that her earnings were insufficient to pay her living \nexpenses, take care of her children, and pay her delinquent accounts. \nApplicant worked for federal contractors, holding a clearance, between 2009 and \n2014. She did not explain why she was unemployed or underemployed between 2014 \nand 2017. She was self-employed between late 2017 and January 2020, and her \ncurrent employer hired her in January 2020. Applicant provided no information \nconcerning her earnings and financial situation during the period 2017 to January 2020, \nto explain what prevented her from contacting her creditors to resolve her debts. \nApplicant was hired in January 2020, submitted her SCA in March 2020, and was \ninterviewed in April 2020. She received favorable credit for paying or resolving eight of \nthe 18 accounts alleged in the SOR, for establishing a payment agreement for the \nwireless services provider, and for starting the process to rehabilitate her student loans. \nNotwithstanding, she failed to establish her good-faith efforts to resolve her delinquent \naccounts and that her financial situation is under control. \nApplicant presented no evidence to show she has participated in financial \ncounseling or that she is following a working budget. She did not present evidence of \nher current financial situation (gross monthly income, deductions, monthly expenses, \nand monthly net remainder). Without any documentary evidence of her current financial \nsituation, it is not possible for me to assess whether or not she is financially \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \noverextended. Her evidence is insufficient to show she has been financially responsible \nunder her circumstances. \nClearance decisions are aimed at evaluating an applicant\u2019s judgment, reliability, \nand trustworthiness. They are not a debt-collection procedure. The guidelines do not \nrequire an applicant to establish resolution of every debt or issue alleged in the SOR. \nAn applicant needs only to establish a plan to resolve financial problems and take \nsignificant actions to implement the plan. There is no requirement that an applicant \nimmediately resolve issues or make payments on all delinquent debts simultaneously, \nnor is there a requirement that the debts or issues alleged in an SOR be resolved first. \nRather, a reasonable plan and concomitant conduct may provide for the payment of \nsuch debts, or resolution of such issues, one at a time. \nIn this instance, the evidence is insufficient to demonstrate Applicant\u2019s current \nfinancial responsibility, and that her financial problems are being resolved and are under \ncontrol. Mere promises to resolve financial issues in the future, without further confirmed \nactions, are insufficient. In this case, Applicant failed to submit sufficient documentary \nevidence of her offers to resolve her financial problems before receipt of the SOR. The \nfinancial considerations security concerns are not mitigated. \nWhole-Person Concept \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case, and under the whole-person \nconcept. Security Executive Agent Directive (SEAD) 4, App. A, \u00b6\u00b6 2(a) and 2(d). I have \nincorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. Some of \nthese factors were addressed under that guideline, but some warrant additional \ncomment. \nApplicant, 36, is being sponsored by a federal contractor for a clearance. She \npreviously served seven years for other federal contractors while possessing a \nclearance. Although circumstances beyond her control contributed to her financial \nproblems, her evidence is insufficient to establish that she has been financially \nresponsible. She failed to establish she has taken good-faith efforts to resolve her \nfinancial problems. \nIt is well settled that once a concern arises regarding an applicant\u2019s security \nclearance eligibility, there is a strong presumption against granting a security clearance. \nSee Dorfmont, 913 F. 2d at 1401. This decision should not be construed as a \ndetermination that Applicant cannot or will not attain the state of reform necessary for \naward of a security clearance in the future. If Applicant continues on her present \nfinancial course, a security clearance could be in her future, but that time is not yet here. \nFinancial considerations security concerns are not mitigated at this time. \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n         \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n____________________________ \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.h: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.i \u2013 1.o: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national security interests of the United States to grant \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance.

Applicant has been employed by a defense contractor since February 2018. He seeks to retain national security eligibility and a security clearance in connection with his employment. He has also been a member of the Navy Reserve since 2016, with the rank of petty officer second class (E-5). (Government Exhibit 1 at Sections 12, 13A, and 15; Tr. 6-7, 23-24.) Paragraph 1 (Guideline J, Criminal Conduct) The Government alleges in this paragraph that Applicant is ineligible for clearance because he has engaged in criminal conduct that creates doubt about a person\u2019s judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. Applicant denied this allegation with explanations. 2 Paragraph 2 (Guideline E, Personal Conduct) The Government alleges in this paragraph that Applicant is ineligible for clearance because he has engaged in activities that show questionable judgment, which raises questions about his reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified or sensitive information. Applicant denied this allegation with explanations.

Department Counsel provided an \neight-page summary of the facts, supported by fourteen Government documents \npertaining to Taiwan, identified as Administrative Notice - I (AN - I). Department Counsel \nalso provided a nine-page summary of facts, supported by 22 Government documents \npertaining to China, identified as Administrative Notice \u2013 II (AN \u2013 II), The documents \nprovide elaboration and context for the summaries. I take administrative notice of the facts \nincluded in the U.S. Government reports. They are limited to matters of general \nknowledge, not subject to reasonable dispute. They are set out in the Findings of Fact. \n(Tr. 21-22.) \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant is 30 years old and single. He has received a bachelor\u2019s degree and \nmaster\u2019s degree from American universities. Applicant has been employed by a defense \ncontractor since February 2018. He seeks to retain national security eligibility and a \nsecurity clearance in connection with his employment. He has also been a member of the \nNavy Reserve since 2016, with the rank of petty officer second class (E-5). (Government \nExhibit 1 at Sections 12, 13A, and 15; Tr. 6-7, 23-24.) \nParagraph 1 (Guideline J, Criminal Conduct) \nThe Government alleges in this paragraph that Applicant is ineligible for clearance \nbecause he has engaged in criminal conduct that creates doubt about a person\u2019s \njudgment, reliability, and trustworthiness.

Applicant denied this allegation with explanations. \nThe Paragraph 1 and Paragraph 2 allegations concern the same event: \nOn August 20, 2019, Applicant was involved in a road-rage incident with another \ndriver. Applicant and the other driver acted in provocative ways towards each other on \nthe highway. When they got off the highway, Applicant stopped at a stop light with the \nother driver behind him. At this point, the other driver got out of his car and approached \nApplicant. Applicant became concerned that the other driver would attack him or his car. \nHe then got out of his car holding a clasp knife for protection. He also stated that his intent \nwas to scare the other driver off. The other driver charged Applicant and they got into a \nmutual fight during which Applicant was hit in the head at least once. During this fight, the \nother driver was cut on his leg by Applicant\u2019s knife. Applicant stated that this was an \naccident, and there is no evidence that it was intentional. After the other driver was cut, a \nthird party separated them until police arrived and took statements from everyone \nconcerned. Applicant was fully cooperative with the police. He was arrested on a charge \nof Assault with a Deadly Weapon. The district attorney elected not to move forward with \nany charges against Applicant. (Government Exhibit 2 at pages 5-6; Government Exhibit \n3; Tr. 13-15, 24-36, 39-41.) \nApplicant received a head injury during the fight with the other driver. Applicant \nExhibit A is the medical report from his provider concerning this injury. (Tr. 38-39.) \nApplicant informed his employer of the arrest as soon as possible after the arrest, \nand of the disposition. He also informed his military supervisor of the incident the evening \nit happened, which her testimony confirmed. (Government Exhibits 4 and 5; Tr. 45.) \nApplicant stated he had never been involved in any other incident like this one. He \nfurther stated his intention was not to hurt anyone but to protect himself and his car. He \nregrets the incident, (Tr. 39-42.) \nParagraph 3 (Guideline B, Foreign Influence) \nThe Government alleges in this paragraph that Applicant is ineligible for clearance \nbecause he has foreign connections that may create a security concern. Applicant denied \nthis allegation with explanations. \nApplicant is a native-born American citizen. From 1992 through 2011, Applicant \nlived with his parents in Taiwan. He returned to the United States in 2011 to attend school \nand has lived in the United States continually since then.

His sister is also a native-\nborn American citizen who also lives in the United States. (Government Exhibit 1 at \nSections 11 and 17; Tr. 17-18.) \nApplicant\u2019s father is a citizen and resident of Taiwan. He and Applicant\u2019s mother \nare divorced. He works as an accountant in Taiwan. Other than Taiwan\u2019s mandatory \nmilitary service when he was a young man, Applicant\u2019s father has no connection to the \nTaiwanese government. Applicant talks to his father every one or two weeks. His father \ncame to the United States after the incident in 2019 to support Applicant. Applicant last \nvisited Taiwan in 2016, before he joined the Navy. Applicant\u2019s father knows very little of \nwhat he does for a living. (Government Exhibit 2; Tr. 16-17, 36-37, 41.) \nTaiwan \nApplicant has contacts with Taiwan. Accordingly, it is appropriate to look at the \ncurrent situation concerning Taiwan. Taiwan is a multiparty democracy; whose authorities \ngenerally respect the human rights of its citizens. Taiwan is an active collector of industrial \ninformation and engages in industrial espionage, as shown by the administrative notice \ndocuments in the record. However, the record does not demonstrate that the Taiwanese \ngovernment seeks to exert pressure on U.S. citizens to collect information from family \nmembers residing in country or abroad. Finally, it is worth noting that the U.S. \nGovernment, and the Defense Department in particular, have a close and continuing \nrelationship with Taiwan and its military, in accordance with the Taiwan Relations Act of \n1979, which has governed policy in the absence of diplomatic relations or a defense treaty \nwith Taiwan. \nChina \nI take administrative notice of the facts set forth in the Administrative Notice \ndocuments concerning China, which are incorporated herein by reference. China is a \nlarge and economically powerful country, with a population of more than a billion people \nand an economy growing at about 10% per year. China has an authoritarian government, \ndominated by the Chinese Communist Party. It has a poor record with respect to human \nrights, suppresses political dissent, and engages in arbitrary arrests and detentions, \nforced confessions, torture, and mistreatment of prisoners. China is one of the most \naggressive countries in seeking sensitive and protected U.S. technology and economic \nintelligence. It targets the United States with active intelligence gathering programs, both \nlegal and illegal. As a result, it is a growing threat to U.S. national security. In addition, \nChina views Taiwan as part of China. China has engaged in many different coercive \ndiplomatic and military activities, seeking to isolate and intimidate Taiwan into unification \non China\u2019s terms. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nMitigation \nApplicant\u2019s military supervisor, a senior chief petty officer (E-8), testified. She has \nknown Applicant for six or seven years. She testified that he is a \u201cgood guy,\u201d and also \nstated that he is \u201ca man of integrity.\u201d (Tr. 43-49.) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for national security eligibility, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines (AG) list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. The entire \nprocess is a conscientious scrutiny of applicable guidelines in the context of a number of \nvariables known as the whole-person concept. The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires, \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. I have not drawn inferences based on mere speculation or \nconjecture. \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.14, requires the Government to present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, \u201cThe applicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d  \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants national \nsecurity eligibility. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the \napplicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as \nto potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified or sensitive information. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFinally, as emphasized in Section 7 of Executive Order 10865, \u201cAny determination under \nthis order adverse to an applicant shall be a determination in terms of the national interest \nand shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d \nSee also Executive Order 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information.) \nAnalysis \nParagraph 1 (Guideline J, Criminal Conduct) \nThe security concerns relating to the guideline for criminal conduct are set out in \nAG \u00b6 30, which states: \nCriminal activity creates doubt about a person\u2019s judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person\u2019s ability or \nwillingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations. \nAG \u00b6 31 describes one condition that could raise security concerns and may be \ndisqualifying in this case: \n(b) evidence (including, but not limited to, a credible allegation, an \nadmission, and matters of official record) of criminal conduct, regardless of \nwhether the individual was formally charged, prosecuted, or convicted. \nApplicant was involved in a road-rage incident with another driver in August 2019. \nHe admitted foolishly getting out of his car with a knife, and from all indications \naccidentally cut the other person during a mutual fight. Police arrested him, but no \ncharges were brought against Applicant by the district attorney. The stated disqualifying \ncondition applies. \nThe guideline includes four conditions in AG \u00b6 32 that could mitigate the security \nconcerns arising from Applicant\u2019s alleged criminal conduct. Two have possible application \nto the facts of this case: \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur and \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; and \n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including, but not limited \nto, the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, restitution, \ncompliance with the terms of parole or probation, job training or higher \neducation, \ngood \nemployment \nrecord, \nor \nconstructive \ncommunity \ninvolvement. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s single arrest occurred in 2019, three years ago. The district attorney \nelected not to proceed with any charges. Applicant admitted his fault in the incident. This \nsingle incident of poor judgement does not indicate a pattern on his part. His conduct has \nbeen exemplary since then, as confirmed by the testimony of his military supervisor. Both \nmitigating conditions apply. Paragraph 1 is found for Applicant. \nParagraph 2 (Guideline E, Personal Conduct) \nThe security concerns relating to the guideline for personal conduct are set out in \nAG \u00b6 15, which states: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. \nAG \u00b6 16 describes three condition that could raise security concerns and may be \ndisqualifying in this case: \n(c) credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is \nnot sufficient for an adverse determination under any other single guideline, \nbut which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-person \nassessment of questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack \nof candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations, or other \ncharacteristics indicating that the individual may not properly safeguard \nclassified or sensitive information; \n(d) credible adverse information that is not explicitly covered under any \nother guideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an adverse \ndetermination, but which, when combined with all available information, \nsupports a whole-person assessment of questionable judgment, \nuntrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with \nrules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that the individual \nmay not properly safeguard classified or sensitive information. This \nincludes, but is not limited to, consideration of: \n(2) any disruptive, violent, or other inappropriate behavior; and \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(e) personal conduct or concealment of information about one\u2019s conduct, \nthat creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress by a \nforeign intelligence entity or other individual or group. Such conduct \nincludes: \n(1) engaging in activities which, if known, could affect the person\u2019s \npersonal, professional, or community standing \nApplicant was involved in a single road-rage incident, as described above. He was \narrested at the time, but the district attorney declined to proceed with the case. All three \ndisqualifying conditions apply to the facts of this case, shifting the burden to Applicant to \nmitigate them. \nThe guideline includes one condition in AG \u00b6 17 that could mitigate the security \nconcerns arising from Applicant\u2019s alleged personal conduct: \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment. \nApplicant admitted that his conduct was foolish. For all the reasons stated under \nParagraph 1, above, I find that AG \u00b6 17(c) applies and provides sufficient mitigation for \nApplicant\u2019s conduct. Paragraph 2 is found for Applicant. \nParagraph 3 (Guideline B, Foreign Influence) \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Foreign Influence is set out in AG \n\u00b6 6: \nForeign contacts and interests, including, but not limited to, business, \nfinancial, and property interests, are a national security concern if they result \nin divided allegiance. They may also be a national security concern if they \ncreate circumstances in which the individual may be manipulated or induced \nto help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a way \ninconsistent with U.S. interests or otherwise made vulnerable to pressure \nor coercion by any foreign interest. Assessment of foreign contacts and \ninterests should consider the country in which the foreign contact or interest \nis located, including, but not limited to, considerations such as whether it is \nknown to target U.S. citizens to obtain classified or sensitive information or \nis associated with a risk of terrorism. \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 7. Two are arguably applicable in this case: \n(a) contact, regardless of method, with a foreign family member, business \nor professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or \nresident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of \nforeign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; and \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual's obligation to \nprotect classified or sensitive information or technology and the individual's \ndesire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing that \ninformation or technology. \nApplicant\u2019s father lives in Taiwan. He contacts his father every one or two weeks. \nThe evidence is sufficient to raise these disqualifying conditions. \nTaiwan is an active collector of industrial espionage. Accordingly, Applicant\u2019s \nfamily connections in that country have the potential to generate a heightened risk of \nforeign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion under AG \u00b6 7(a). \nThe mere possession of close family ties with a person in a foreign country is not, as a \nmatter of law, disqualifying under Guideline B. However, if only one relative lives in a \nforeign country and an applicant has contacts with that relative, this factor alone is \nsufficient to create the potential for foreign influence and could potentially result in the \ncompromise of classified information. (See ISCR Case No. 03-02382 at 5 (App. Bd. Feb. \n15, 2006); ISCR Case No. 99-0424 (App. Bd. Feb. 8, 2001).) \nAG \u00b6 8 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. I considered all \nof the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 8 including: \n(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in which \nthese persons are located, or the positions or activities of those persons in \nthat country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be placed in a \nposition of having to choose between the interests of a foreign individual, \ngroup, organization, or government and the interests of the United States; \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of \nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, or allegiance to the group, \ngovernment, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such deep and \nlongstanding relationships and loyalties in the United States, that the \nindividual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the \nU.S. interest; and \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(c) contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and \ninfrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign \ninfluence or exploitation. \nApplicant is a native-born American citizen. His mother and sister are also \nAmerican citizens. His relationship with his father is distant, consisting mainly of \ntelephone calls. His personal, professional, and family connections in the United States \nstrongly outweigh his connections to Taiwan. AG \u00b6\u00b6 8(a), (b), and (c) apply. Paragraph 3 \nis found for Applicant. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s potential for national security eligibility by considering the totality of the \napplicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should \nconsider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant national security \neligibility for a security clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon \ncareful consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \npertinent facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant has mitigated the \nconcerns regarding his single incident of criminal conduct and related personal conduct. \nHis father\u2019s presence in Taiwan has also been mitigated. Overall, the record evidence \ndoes not create substantial doubt as to Applicant\u2019s present suitability for national security \neligibility and a security clearance. \n10 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline J: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 1.a: \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 2.a: \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 3, Guideline B: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 3.a: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s national security \neligibility for a security clearance.

Applicant did not respond. On May 13, 2022, the case was assigned to me.  \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant is a 37-year old married woman with three pre-teen children. Applicant \nearned an associate degree in 2006 and a bachelor\u2019s degree in 2008. (Item 3 at 11) She \nhas been working for her current employer as a program control analyst since February \n2011. (Item 3 at 13; Item 4 at 2) \nApplicant incurred 11 debts, totaling approximately $39,000, as alleged in the SOR. \nApplicant attributes incurring these debts to spending beyond her means and in a \nfinancially irresponsible manner using credit cards. (Item 4 at 9) Applicant contends that \nthe debts alleged in subparagraph 1.b and 1.e, as well as those in 1.c and 1.d are \nduplicative; however, she provided no evidence. (Item 2 at 2) Also, she contends that she \nsatisfied the debts alleged in subparagraphs 1.b, 1.c, 1.f, and 1.g, totaling $27,000. (Item 2 \nat 2) She provided no documentary evidence. \nApplicant did not disclose any delinquent debts, as required, on her February 2020 \nsecurity clearance application. (Item 3 at 33-34) During her April 2020 subject interview, \nshe was asked whether she had any delinquent debts and again failed to acknowledge any \nsuch debts to the investigator before being presented with proof of the delinquencies on \nher credit report. (Item 4 at 4) When the agent showed her the credit report containing \nthese delinquencies, Applicant explained that she omitted the information because there \nwas no place to enter it on the security clearance application. (Item 4 at 5) In her answer, \nshe explained that she omitted the information because she \u201cwent through these specific \nquestions too fast\u201d when completing the application. (Item 2 at 3) \nPolicies \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion the Executive \nBranch has in regulating access to information pertaining to national security, emphasizing \nthat \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 \nU.S. 518, 528 (1988). When evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, \nthe administrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are required to be considered in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. These guidelines \nare not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, \nthese guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative \nprocess. The administrative judge\u2019s overall adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious \nscrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \njudge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, \nfavorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 1(d) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence \nto establish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant \nis responsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . ..\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must consider the totality \nof an applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant circumstances in light of the nine adjudicative \nprocess factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). They are as follows: \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; \n(2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; \n(3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; \n(4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; \n(5) the extent to which participation is voluntary; \n(6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral \nchanges; \n(7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and \n(9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nAnalysis \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nUnder this concern, \u201cfailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to \nabide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about an individual\u2019s \nreliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified or sensitive information.\u201d (AG \u00b6 \n18) Applicant\u2019s history of financial problems triggers the application of AG \u00b6 19(a), \u201cinability \nto satisfy debts,\u201d and AG \u00b6 19(c), \u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations.\u201d \nApplicant\u2019s financial problems remain ongoing. Therefore, AG \u00b6 20(a), \u201cthe behavior \nhappened so long ago . . . that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the \nindividual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment,\u201d does not apply. \nApplicant acknowledges that her financial problems were caused by irresponsible \nspending. Under these circumstances. AG \u00b6 20(b), \u201cthe conditions that resulted in the \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nfinancial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s control . . . and the individual acted \nresponsibly under the circumstances,\u2019 does not apply. \nApplicant provided no evidence supporting her contention that she has satisfied \nseveral of the debts, and she provided no evidence supporting her contention that she is \nworking with a credit counselor to resolve her debts. I conclude that AG \u00b620(c), the \nindividual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the problem from a legitimate \nand credible source, such as a non-profit credit counseling service, and there are clear \nindications that the problem is being resolved or is under control,\u201d and AG \u00b6 20(d), \u201cthe \nindividual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \notherwise resolve debts,\u201d do not apply. \nIn sum, Applicant has failed to mitigate the financial considerations security \nconcerns. \nGuideline E: Personal Conduct \nUnder this guideline, \u201cconduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, \ndishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions about \nan individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified or sensitive \ninformation.\u201d (AG \u00b6 15) Moreover, \u201cof special interest is any failure to cooperate or provide \ntruthful and candid answers during national security investigative or adjudicative \nprocesses.\u201d (Id.) Applicant\u2019s omission of relevant financial information from her security \n2020 clearance application raises the issue of whether AG \u00b6 16(a), \u201cdeliberate omission, \nconcealment, or falsification of relevant facts from any personnel security questionnaire, \npersonal history statement, or similar form used to conduct investigations, determine \nemployment qualifications, award benefits or status, determine national security eligibility \nor trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities,\u201d applies. \nApplicant\u2019s explanation, set forth in her answer for omitting the debts contradicted \nher explanation that she told the investigative agent, earlier. Under these circumstances, I \nconclude Applicant is not credible, and that AG \u00b6 16(a) applies without mitigation. Applicant \nfailed to mitigate the personal conduct security concern. \nWhole-Person Concept \nI have considered the whole-person concept factors in my analysis of the \ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions, and they do not warrant a favorable conclusion. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n_____________________ \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.k: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact In answering the original SOR, Applicant admitted SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.g. He admitted the cross-allegation at SOR \u00b6 2.a, but denied SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.b through 2.e, as well as the cross-allegation at SOR \u00b6 3.a. Each of his answers included explanations. Applicant\u2019s SOR admissions are incorporated into the findings of fact. After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings and exhibits submitted, I make the following additional findings of fact. 2 Applicant is 36 years old. His only marriage (2013-2019) ended in divorce. He has no children. He lives with his long-term girlfriend. He served in the U.S. Army from 2006 to 2014. His duties included a 17-month combat tour in Iraq (2008-2009), a one- year deployment to Qatar (April 2010 to April 2011), and several months in Afghanistan (2013).

Sykstus, Esq. \n11/14/2022 \nDecision \nMURPHY, Braden M., Administrative Judge: \nApplicant has incurred numerous arrests and convictions for alcohol-related \ndriving offenses between September 2004 and August 2021, including one that \noccurred after issuance of the Statement of Reasons. He remains on probation until \nApril 2023. He also was not fully candid about his record during the security clearance \nprocess on multiple occasions. He did not provide sufficient evidence to mitigate the \nresulting security concerns alleged under Guideline G (alcohol consumption), Guideline \nJ (criminal conduct), and Guideline E (personal conduct). Eligibility for access to \nclassified information is denied. \nStatement of the Case \nApplicant submitted his most recent security clearance application (SCA) on \nDecember 26, 2019. On January 4, 2021, the Defense Counterintelligence and Security \nAgency Consolidated Adjudications Facility (CAF) issued a Statement of Reasons \n(SOR) to Applicant alleging and cross-alleging security concerns under Guidelines G \n(alcohol involvement), Guideline E (personal conduct) and Guideline J (criminal \nconduct). The CAF issued the SOR under Executive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; \n1 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nDepartment of Defense (DOD) Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security \nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and Security \nExecutive Agent Directive 4, National Security Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) \nimplemented by the DOD on June 8, 2017. \nApplicant answered the SOR on February 24, 2021, and requested a hearing \nbefore an administrative judge from the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals \n(DOHA). His four attached documents were marked at his hearing as SOR Exhibits 1 \nthrough 4. (Tr. 18) Processing of this case was delayed significantly by the COVID-19 \npandemic. The case was first assigned to another DOHA administrative judge on March \n16, 2022. On April 20, 2022, DOHA issued a notice scheduling an in-person hearing on \nMay 18, 2022 at a location near where Applicant lives and works. The case was \nassigned to me on May 10, 2022, after the initial administrative judge became \nunavailable. \nThe hearing convened as scheduled. Department Counsel offered Government\u2019s \nExhibits (GE) 1 through 8, and Applicant\u2019s counsel offered Applicant\u2019s Exhibits (AE) A \nthrough I. All of the exhibits (including the SOR attachments) were admitted without \nobjection. Applicant and two other witnesses also testified. DOHA received the hearing \ntranscript (Tr.) on May 31, 2022. \nAmendment to the SOR \nDuring his hearing testimony, Applicant disclosed an alcohol-related offense that \noccurred after issuance of the SOR. Department Counsel therefore moved to amend \nthe SOR under \u00b6 E.3.1.17 of the Directive by adding the following allegation for good \ncause shown. \n1.h. You were arrested in August 2021, in [City, State] and charged with \nDUI. In April 2022, you pleaded guilty to DUI and were sentenced to one \nyear of probation. \nThe cross-allegations under Guidelines E and J (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.a and 3.a) were also \namended to incorporate SOR \u00b6 1.h. The amendments were accepted without objection \nand Applicant\u2019s counsel did not request to provide additional evidence. (Tr. 51-55, 145-\n146) \nFindings of Fact \nIn answering the original SOR, Applicant admitted SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.g. He \nadmitted the cross-allegation at SOR \u00b6 2.a, but denied SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.b through 2.e, as well \nas the cross-allegation at SOR \u00b6 3.a. Each of his answers included explanations. \nApplicant\u2019s SOR admissions are incorporated into the findings of fact. After a thorough \nand careful review of the pleadings and exhibits submitted, I make the following \nadditional findings of fact. \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant is 36 years old. His only marriage (2013-2019) ended in divorce. He \nhas no children. He lives with his long-term girlfriend. He served in the U.S. Army from \n2006 to 2014. His duties included a 17-month combat tour in Iraq (2008-2009), a one-\nyear deployment to Qatar (April 2010 to April 2011), and several months in Afghanistan \n(2013). He held a clearance in the Army, first granted in 2007 and then granted on a \nconditional basis in 2012. Applicant earned his bachelor\u2019s degree in 2017, graduating \ncum laude, and he earned a master\u2019s degree in business administration (MBA) in May \n2021, with a 3.73 GPA. He has worked for a defense contractor as a research analyst \nfor about two years. (Answer; GE 1, AE D, AE H, AE I; Tr. 10, 22-33) \nIn the Army, Applicant was awarded three Army Commendation Medals, five \nArmy Achievement Medals, campaign medals for service in Afghanistan (one campaign \nstar) and Iraq (two campaign stars), the Combat Action Badge, and other appropriate \nservice medals, ribbons, and badges. (AE D; AE E) He received a general discharge \nunder honorable conditions, following his 2013 alcohol-related offense discussed below. \nHe has a 70% service-connected disability rating from the Department of Veterans \nAffairs, due to PTSD. (AE B, AE C) \nGuidelines G and J:  \nApplicant has a history of alcohol-related offenses, from 2004 to August 2021. \n(GE 4 \u2013 8; SOR Ex. 2) They are detailed as follows: \n(1) In December 2004, around Christmas, Applicant was arrested and charged in \nhis home state (State 1) with driving under the influence of alcohol (DUI) and underage\npossession of alcohol. At the time, he was grieving the recent death of his grandmother.\nIn April 2005, he was convicted of both offenses, placed on probation, and ordered to\nattend an alcohol safety awareness program. (ASAP) (SOR \u00b6 1.a) He initially failed to\ncomplete the ASAP program, as alleged, because he had difficulty attending daytime\nASAP classes without reliable transporation. The judge gave him another chance, and\nhe completed the classes. (Answer; GE 6; Tr. 83, 87-88, 90) There is no indication that\nhis probation was \u201crevoked\u201d as alleged, particularly in August 2006 (as alleged), a\nmonth before he enlisted in the Army. Applicant also disclosed the offense on his\nSeptember 2006 SCA, prepared at the time. (GE 2) \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(2) In early December 2009, Applicant was arrested in State 2 and charged with \nDUI. In March 2010, he pleaded guilty to a lesser charge of first-degree negligent \ndriving. He was fined about $1,260 and sentenced to 90 days in jail, of which all but five \ndays were suspended. (SOR \u00b6 1.b) Three months before the arrest, he had returned \nstateside from a lengthy combat tour in Iraq and had difficulty readjusting due to PTSD. \nHe testified that he was with friends in a large, nearby city. He was pulled over after \ngetting lost on the drive back to post. He was taken into custody by local police. He did \nnot serve time in jail, but instead was in a work release or weekend program, which he \nfulfilled in September 2010 (when he was in the U.S. for a court hearing for his next \noffense, discussed below).

(SOR \u00b6 1.c) He \ntestified that he drove a fellow soldier to the airport and returned to post in the friend\u2019s \ncar. He had been drinking earlier in the day, and stumbled when he got out of the car at \nthe post gate. (Tr. 92-94; GE 8, GE 9 at 1-19) \nIn April 2010, while Applicant\u2019s offense was pending in federal court, a federal \nmagistrate judge allowed him to deploy for a year with his Army unit to Qatar. Since \nalcohol use was not permitted there, Applicant could deploy and fulfill his court-ordered \nabstention requirement. While in Qatar, he also participated in court-ordered \ncounseling, though he said it was not specifically \u201calcohol counseling.\u201d (Tr. 82-83) (See \ndiscussion of SOR \u00b6 2.c, below) \nApplicant was subsequently evaluated and found to be chemically dependent on \nalcohol and amenable to treatment. (GE 5 at 2) (This diagnosis is referenced in a \nSeptember 2010 court order but is not itself documented in the record here). Relying on \nthis diagnosis, the federal magistrate authorized Applicant\u2019s placement into a five-year \ndeferred prosecution program. Applicant was also ordered to attend and successfully \ncomplete a two-year alcohol treatment program. (SOR \u00b6 1.d) (Answer; SOR Ex. 3; Tr. \n65-70, 95-96; GE 5 at 7, GE 8) \nAs part of the deferred prosecution program, Applicant was, in part, required: a) \nto abstain from alcohol consumption; b) to comply with the law and not to \u201ccommit any \nalcohol/drug offenses or other criminal offenses during the period of deferral;\u201d and c) to \nnotify U.S. Probation \u201cwithin 72 hours of being arrested, questioned, or cited by law \nenforcement.\u201d Failure to comply was potential grounds for removal from the deferred \nprosecution program. (GE 5 at 8, 10) Applicant signed the judge\u2019s order and also \nacknowledged the requirements of his probation. (GE 5 at 9, 10; Tr. 68-69) \nApplicant said he fulfilled the requirements of his counseling in Qatar before he \nreturned to the U.S. in April 2011. (Tr. 68) He said he did not have contact with his U.S. \nprobation officer when he returned to this country. (Tr. 100) It is not clear that he fulfilled \nthe requirements of the \u201ctwo-year treatment program\u201d after he returned from Qatar. \n(4) In September 2011, months after he returned from Qatar, Applicant was \narrested in State 1, where he was then serving in the Army, and charged with driving\nwhile intoxicated (DWI), 2nd  Offense within 5-10 years, and with refusing a blood or \nbreath test. In February 2012, he was found not guilty on both counts after a bench trial.\n(SOR \u00b6 1.e) Applicant explained that he was stopped by a police officer after a gas \nstation attendant reported seeing multiple highly intoxicated individuals exiting a red \nSUV. Applicant said he was driving a red SUV but was alone, in military uniform, and\nnot intoxicated. (Answer; GE 7 at 1-3; Tr. 70-71, 96-100) \n \n \n \n \nApplicant acknowledged under questioning that he knew and understood at the \ntime that he had been arrested, taken into custody by the police, taken to jail, and \ncharged with DWI, even though he was later found not guilty at trial. He did not recall if \nhe had been drinking at the time. (Tr. 96-100) He said he disclosed the offense to his \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nchain of command, but acknowledged that he did not inform his federal probation officer \nof this arrest, and, in hindsight, said that he should have done so. (Tr. 71, 100, 103) \n(5) In December 2013, Applicant was arrested on an Army post in State 3 and \ncharged with drunk driving. He had a blood-alcohol content (BAC) of 0.187. He \nappeared at an Article 15 hearing and was found guilty under Article 111 of the Uniform \nCode of Military Justice (UCMJ) of being in \u201cPhysical Control of a Vehicle while Drunk.\u201d \n(SOR \u00b6 1.f) (GE 8, GE 9 at 21-30) Applicant asserted that when he was arrested, he \nhad not been driving, but was sitting in his car listening to music (with the key in the \nignition but the engine off). The day before, he had returned from a combat deployment \nto Afghanistan. He chose to accept the Article 15 findings rather than request a court-\nmartial, since he was soon to leave the Army and pursue an education. (Answer) He \nreceived a general discharge under honorable conditions, as noted above. (Tr. 30; AE \nD) \nApplicant acknowledged that he had been drinking prior to this arrest, and that, in \nhindsight, he should not have done so under the terms of his federal deferred \nprosecution following offense # 3. (Tr. 71-73; GE 5 at 10)) However, he also asserted \nthat he believed his chain of command and security officials were aware of the offense. \n(Tr. 101-102) \nIn October 2015, the federal magistrate judge dismissed the deferred prosecution \nof Applicant\u2019s December 2009 DUI (Offense # 2), on the grounds that he had \nsuccessfully completed the program. (GE 5) (There is no indication that the court was \naware of either Offense #4 or Offense # 5, above). \n(6) In January 2020, Applicant was arrested in State 1 and charged with DUI,\nrefusing a breath sample, and drinking while driving with an open container of alcohol. \nIn October 2020, he was found guilty of DUI. He received a 90-day suspended jail term, \ntwo years of probation and a fine. The remaining charges were dismissed. (SOR \u00b6 1.g) \n(GE 7) Applicant said in his answer that he was returning home from a family social \nevent, and was stopped because he did not have his headlights on. He had an open \ncontainer of alcohol in the vehicle. He attended a court-ordered alcohol treatment \nassessment and six weeks of counseling. He also attended voluntary behavioral \ncounseling. (Answer; Tr. 82) His probation for this offense was scheduled to end in \nOctober 2022. (Tr. 55, 117) \n \n(7) During his direct testimony at his DOHA hearing, Applicant disclosed that in \nAugust 2021, he was arrested in State 4, where he now lives, and charged with DUI. \n(SOR \u00b6 1.h) Applicant said he had been at home and had \u201ca couple drinks.\u201d He had \nbeen doing yard work and left the house to get a massage for his back. He was pulled \nover for speeding. In April 2022, he pleaded guilty to DUI and was sentenced to one \nyear of probation. He was referred to a substance abuse counselor for a 12-hour \ncourse. At the time of his DOHA hearing he had attended four or the required nine \nsessions. He is required to call in weekly and to provide urine samples as needed. He \nhas passed them all and has paid all fines and fees. He is required to remain \u201cclean and \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nsober\u201d and to obey the law. He has a probation officer. He remains on probation for the \noffense until April 2023. (Tr. 35-36, 47-51, 81-82, 121-122) \nApplicant acknowledged in his testimony that he had yet to report his latest DUI \nto his State 1 probation officer. He was unclear as to the terms of that probation, and \nwas not sure he was required to report the arrest when it occurred. His most recent DUI \nwas adjudicated only two weeks before his DOHA hearing, and he intended to disclose \nthe matter to his State 1 probation officer as soon as his DOHA hearing was concluded. \n(Tr. 55-57, 117-120) \nApplicant was sober for about six years while attending college after the Army \nand afterwards. He did well in schoo and was happier. He later resumed drinking, \nbelieving he was mature and responsible enough to do so. (Tr. 84-85) \nApplicant said he does not believe he has ever been diagnosed with alcoholism \nor alcohol dependence by a professional counselor, assessor, or treatment \nprofessional. (Tr. 111-112) However, the federal magistrate\u2019s 2010 order placing him \ninto the deferred prosecution program addresses the fact that Applicant was found \nchemically dependent on alcohol in an assessment. (GE 5) That assessment is not \nalleged in the SOR, so I will not consider it as disqualifying conduct. \nWhen he was married, Applicant attended counseling through the VA at the \nurging of his wife, in about 2014, after he was discharged from the Army. He solicited \nthe VA for an assessment of his PTSD and was referred to a counselor. He also saw a \ncounselor twice in the summer of 2018. He has not been in treatment or counseling for \nhis PTSD since then. Applicant acknowledged a \u201clinkage\u201d between his alcohol issues \nand his PTSD, noting that his December 2009 DUIs and his 2013 DUI all occurred \nshortly after he returned from deployments. (Tr. 75-79) \nFollowing his 2020 DUI, Applicant attended voluntary substance abuse \ncounseling with Ms. W between about January and March 2021. He successfully \ncompleted the program, which included five behavioral health education and counseling \nsessions over six weeks. Further treatment was not recommended. (Tr. 56-61; SOR Ex. \n1; AE A) (Applicant\u2019s most recent DUI occurred five months later). \nApplicant said he attempted sobriety after his 2020 arrest, but it was not until his \nmost recent arrest that he \u201creally sat down and talked with my family and became \nhonest with myself. Everything states that I have an addiction\u201d to alcohol. He believes \nthat without alcohol, he would have had more success in the military. He gets a lot of \nsupport from his family and his girlfriend. He said this latest incident led to an \u201cepiphany\u201d \nand he realized that he is battling addiction and alcoholism. He said he has not had a \ndrink since his latest DUI, in August 2021. He sought out on-line AA meetings soon \nthereafter, including some with military veterans. He attends AA meetings several times \na week. This is voluntary and not court ordered. He has deep regrets that his alcohol \nissues ended his Army career.

The CAF noted that \u201cfailure to successfully complete your \nprobation requirements or other subsequent unfavorable information may result in the \nsuspension of your clearance.\u201d The CAF noted that, at the time, Applicant was in the \nfive-year deferred prosecution program, following his second December 2009 DUI, GE \n4 at 32) \nIn SOR \u00b6 2.e, the Government alleged that Applicant\u2019s December 2013 DUI \narrest (Offense # 5) constituted a violation of both his federal probation and the terms of \nhis conditional clearance. Applicant denied SOR \u00b6 2.e and asserted that his conduct did \nnot violate any probation requirements. (Answer) He also testified that DOD took no \naction to revoke or suspend his conditional clearance following his arrests in either 2011 \nor 2013. (Tr. 102-104) During closing argument, Department Counsel conceded that \nthere was no documentary evidence to support a finding that SOR \u00b6 2.e was \nestablished. Specifically, there was no record evidence that the federal magistrate judge \nhad ruled that Applicant had violated his probation following his December 2009 arrest. \nNor was there evidence to show that the DOD CAF had ever acted upon Applicant\u2019s \n2013 DUI offense (at least as to his 2012 conditional clearance).

He disclosed offense #s 1, 2, and 5, above, but not \noffense #s 3 or 4 (GE 1 at 32-36). The Government alleged that these omissions were \ndeliberate falsifications, an allegation he denied. (SOR \u00b6 2.a) \nAs to SOR \u00b6 2.b, the SCA question at issue asks, \u201cHave you EVER been \ncharged with an offense involving alcohol or drugs?\u201d Applicant asserted in his Answer \nthat he interpreted the question as requiring disclosure of offenses of which he had \nbeen \u201cconvicted\u201d rather than \u201ccharged.\u201d (Answer) He testified that he also did not have \nthe proper paperwork with him when he completed the SCA. He said he was confused \nabout whether he should report the second December 2009 offense (Offense # 3), since \nit led to a deferred prosecution. He also said he paid for an online criminal background \ncheck and it was not listed.

(Tr. 41-43, 64-65, 105-09) \nApplicant also allegedly failed to disclose on his SCA both that he had been \nordered to seek counseling or treatment as a result of his use of alcohol, and that he \nhad received such counseling or treatment, as ordered by the federal magistrate in \nSeptember 2010. (GE 1 at 37; SOR \u00b6 2.c) Applicant denied the allegation of deliberate \nfalsification.

(GE 3) In November 2020, Applicant authenticated and \nadopted the summaries of both interviews without comment. (GE 3 at 14) \nSOR \u00b6 2.d alleged that Applicant deliberately withheld information from the \ninterviewer, in both interviews, about the fact of his second December 2009 DUI. As \nabove, he continued to assert that he had not been convicted in the latter incident. \n(Answer) Applicant acknowledged that the interviewing agent confronted him with \nevidence of the December 2009 DUI before he disclosed it. (Tr. 113-116) \nApplicant also did not disclose in those background interviews that he had been \narrested for DUI in January 2020, only weeks before.

(AE F, AE G) \nPolicies \nIt is well established that no one has a right to a security clearance. As the \nSupreme Court held in Department of the Navy v.

Instead, recognizing the complexities of \nhuman behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d Under \u00b6 E3.1.14, the \nGovernment must present evidence to establish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. \nUnder \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is responsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other \nevidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or \nproven by Department Counsel.\u201d The applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to \nobtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information.

The following disqualifying condition is applicable in this case: \n(a) alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while under \nthe influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or \nother incidents of concern, regardless of the frequency of the individual\u2019s \nalcohol use or whether the individual has been diagnosed with an alcohol \nuse disorder.  \nApplicant has incurred numerous arrests for alcohol-related offenses, beginning \nin 2004, when he was 17 years old, up to August 2021. AG \u00b6 22(a) applies. \nConditions that could mitigate alcohol consumption security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 23. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) so much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, \nor judgment; \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her pattern of maladaptive alcohol \nuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and \nhas demonstrated a clear and established pattern of modified \nconsumption \nor \nabstinence \nin \naccordance \nwith \ntreatment \nrecommendations; and  \n(d) the individual has successfully completed a treatment program along \nwith any required aftercare, and has demonstrated a clear and established \npattern of modified consumption or abstinence in accordance with \ntreatment recommendations.  \nApplicant has a long and troubled history of alcohol involvement that spreads \nthroughout his adult life. He has incurred six alcohol-related arrests and convictions (not \ncounting 2011, when he was found not guilty). He has incurred two offenses in the last \n10 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ntwo years, and, at the time the hearing ended, he was on probation for both of them \n(with the second probation period to end in April 2023). He attested that his most DUI \narrest was an \u201cepiphany\u201d that has led him to acknowledge his alcohol issues. He began \nattending AA regularly, and has not consumed alcohol since August 2021. But his \nefforts must be balanced against his entire record. The fact remains that his history and \npattern of DUIs is too established, his latest offenses are too recent, and his period of \nabstinence and AA are too short. He did not establish that his offenses occurred under \nunusual circumstances, that his alcohol-related misconduct is unlikely to recur, or that \nhis behavior no longer casts doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, or \njudgment. \nAdditionally, there is the matter of Applicant\u2019s established pattern and ongoing \nnature of falsifications and lack of candor, addressed below under Guideline E, which \nsignificantly undercuts any showing of mitigation under other Guidelines. Applicant did \nnot establish that any of the above Guideline G mitigating conditions should apply. \nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct  \nAG \u00b6 30 expresses the security concern for criminal conduct: \nCriminal activity creates doubt about a person's judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person's ability \nor willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations. \nAG \u00b6 31 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. The following disqualifying conditions are potentially applicable: \n(a) a pattern of minor offenses, any one of which on its own would be \nunlikely to affect a national security eligibility decision, but which in \ncombination cast doubt on the individual\u2019s judgment, reliability, or \ntrustworthiness;  \n(b) evidence (including, but not limited to, a credible allegation, an \nadmission, and matters of official record) of criminal conduct, regardless of \nwhether the individual was formally charged, prosecuted, or convicted; \nand  \n(c) individual is currently on parole or probation. \nApplicant has incurred numerous arrests and convictions for DUIs and other \nalcohol-related offenses, from 2004 until August 2021, including two such charges and \nconvictions after he submitted his December 2019 SCA, and one after the January 2021 \nSOR. At the time of the hearing, he was on probation for his two most recent offenses. \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 31(a), 31(b), and 31(c) all apply. \n11 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \nThe following mitigating conditions for criminal conduct are potentially applicable \nunder AG \u00b6 32: \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur \nand does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, trustworthiness, or \ngood judgment;  \n(c) no reliable evidence to support that the individual committed the \noffense;  \n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including, but not limited \nto, the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, restitution, \ncompliance with the terms of parole or probation, job training or higher \neducation, \ngood \nemployment \nrecord, \nor \nconstructive \ncommunity \ninvolvement. \nApplicant was found not guilty of Offense # 4, his DWI arrest in 2011. While the \narrest is established (as is the fact that he did not disclose the arrest to his federal \nprobation officer, as he should have), it is not established that he was drinking at the \ntime. Having been found not guilty, AG \u00b6 32(c) is established to mitigate SOR \u00b6 1.e (as \ncross-alleged by reference under Guideline J in SOR \u00b6 2.a). \nNotwithstanding Applicant\u2019s excellent work record and recent participation in AA, \nno other Guideline J mitigating conditions apply, for the same reasons as set forth under \nGuideline G, above. Most significantly, as of the date of the hearing, he was on \nprobation for his two most recent offenses, until October 2022 and April 2023, \nrespectively. Applicant did not provide sufficient evidence to mitigate the criminal \nconduct security concerns. \nGuideline E \nAG \u00b6 15 details the security concern regarding personal conduct: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. The following will normally result \nin an unfavorable national security eligibility determination, security \nclearance action, or cancellation of further processing for national security \neligibility: \n(a) refusal, or failure without reasonable cause, to undergo or cooperate \nwith security processing, including but not limited to meeting with a \nsecurity investigator for subject interview, completing security forms or \n12 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nreleases, cooperation with medical or psychological evaluation, or \npolygraph examination, if authorized and required; and \n(b) refusal to provide full, frank, and truthful answers to lawful questions of \ninvestigators, security officials, or other official representatives in \nconnection with a personnel security or trustworthiness determination. \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. The following disqualifying conditions are potentially applicable: \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from any \npersonnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar form \nused to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, award \nbenefits or status, determine national security eligibility or trustworthiness, or \naward fiduciary responsibilities; \n(b) deliberately providing false or misleading information; or concealing or \nomitting information, concerning relevant facts to an employer, investigator, \nsecurity official, competent medical or mental health professional involved in \nmaking a recommendation relevant to a national security eligibility determination, \nor other official government representative; \n(c) credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is not \nsufficient for an adverse determination under any other single guideline, but \nwhich, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-person assessment of \nquestionable \njudgment, \nuntrustworthiness, \nunreliability, \nlack \nof \ncandor, \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations, or other characteristics \nindicating that the individual may not properly safeguard classified or sensitive \ninformation; and  \n(d) credible adverse information that is not explicitly covered under any other\nguideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an adverse determination, but\nwhich, when combined with all available information, supports a whole-person\nassessment of questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of\ncandor, unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations, or other\ncharacteristics indicating that the individual may not properly safeguard classified\nor sensitive information.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 2.a is a cross-allegation of Applicant\u2019s alcohol-related offenses, already \ndiscussed above under both Guidelines G and J. Since those allegations are \u201csufficient \nfor an adverse determination\u201d under both guidelines, AG \u00b6 16(c) does not apply. \nHowever, his conduct as detailed under the cross-allegation remains a personal \nconduct security concern under the general concern of AG \u00b6 15 due to Applicant\u2019s \nrepeated instances of poor judgment and failures to comply with rules and regulations \nthat are clearly established by his record. \n13 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 2.e alleges that Applicant \u201cviolated the terms of [his] federal probation\u201d \nand the terms of his 2012 conditional clearance granted by the DOD CAF \u201cby drinking \nalcohol and committing alcohol-related offenses on, at least, December 11, 2013.\u201d As \nnoted during closing argument, there is no record evidence that the federal magistrate \never made such a finding, or was aware of conduct by the Applicant that might have led \nhim to do so. (Tr. 151-152) Indeed, what is documented here is the fact that Applicant \ncompleted the five-year deferment program successfully. While he likely \u201cviolated the \nterms of his federal probation\u201d by consuming alcohol while in the deferred prosecution \nprogram, that is a question better left to the magistrate judge who had authority to make \nthat determination at the time. \nWith respect to whether Applicant violated the terms of his conditional clearance, \nthat, too, was not determined at the time, since there is no record of a subsequent \nadjudication of that conduct before this one, either by DOHA or the CAF. Further, that \nconduct is already alleged under Guideline E as part of SOR \u00b6 2.a. As such, that portion \nof SOR \u00b6 2.e is essentially duplicative. The allegation is therefore not established, under \nAG \u00b6 16(d) or otherwise. \nThe alleged falsifications are another matter. On his 2019 SCA, the SCA \nquestion at issue asks, \u201cHave you EVER been charged with an offense involving alcohol \nor drugs?\u201d Applicant disclosed some of his DUI arrests, but not all of them. He disclosed \nhis offenses from December 2004, early December 2009, and December 2013, but not \nthe ones from late December 2009 or September 2011. He asserted that he believed he \nhad to report only offenses of which he was convicted. The plain language of the \nquestion says otherwise. For both of the omitted offenses, he acknowledged that he \nknew he had been arrested, taken into custody, and charged. One of them, the \nDecember 2009 offense, was on federal property, a U.S. Army post, circumstances that \nmake his omission less credible, particularly on a DOD security clearance application. \nHis explanations for his omissions are not credible, and SOR \u00b6 2.b is established. \nSOR \u00b6 2.c is also established. On his 2019 SCA, Applicant was asked, among \nother related questions, \u201cHave you EVER been ordered, advised, or asked to seek \ncounseling or treatment as a result of your use of alcohol?\u201d Applicant did not disclose \nthat the federal magistrate had ordered him to participate in a two-year alcohol \ntreatment program \u2013 a recommendation made in an assessment provided by Applicant \nhimself (through counsel) in support of his petition for acceptance into the five-year \ndeferred prosecution program. Applicant also signed acknowledgment of that treatment \nprogram at the time, in September 2010. Whether the counseling he received in Qatar \nwas \u201calcohol counseling\u201d is beside the point. SOR \u00b6 2.c is established. \nFinally, as to SOR \u00b6 2.d, Applicant allegedly failed to disclose that he had two \nDUIs in December 2009, rather than one. SOR \u00b6 2.d alleged that Applicant deliberately \nwithheld information from the interviewer, in both his February 2020 and March 2020 \ninterviews, about the fact of his second December 2009 DUI. As above, he continued to \nassert that he had not been convicted in the latter incident. (Answer) Applicant \nacknowledged that the interviewing agent confronted him with evidence of the \nDecember 2009 DUI before he disclosed it. (Tr. 113-116) \n14 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant also did not disclose in those background interviews that he had been \narrested for DUI in January 2020, only weeks before. He asserted that he \u201cdidn\u2019t think \nabout it\u201d and was just reacting to the questions he was being asked. Deliberately failing \nto disclose his January 2020 DUI was not alleged as part of SOR \u00b6 2.d. However, it \nsignificantly undercuts the validity and credibility of his explanations for why he did not \ndisclose the second December 2009 DUI, an instance of lack of candor which was \nalleged in SOR \u00b6 2.d. I find that SOR \u00b6 2.d is therefore established. \nAG \u00b6 17 details the personal conduct mitigating conditions. The following warrant \ndiscussion: \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; and  \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling\nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, \nunreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely \nto recur. \n \n \nNone of these mitigating conditions are established. Applicant has a long record \nof alcohol-related poor judgment, lack of impulse control, and repeated failures to \ncomply with rules and regulations. He not only has a long criminal record, he has an \nestablished history of lack of candor about it \u2013 not only during the security clearance \nprocess, but to probation authorities. Applicant also failed to disclose not only the full \nextent of his alcohol-related criminal offenses on his SCA, he failed to exercise full \ncandor during his background interviews. His failure to disclose his January 2020 DUI in \nsecurity clearance background interviews that occurred within weeks of that offense is \nparticularly damaging. Whether his alcohol issues and related arrests constituted a \nviolation of \u201cthe terms of his probation,\u201d he clearly has multiple instances of failure to \ninform probation authorities about his subsequent offenses. And this, of course, is \nongoing, since he had yet to inform his State 1 probation officer about his most recent \narrest at the time of his hearing. No personal conduct mitigating conditions apply. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(c):  \n15 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments \nunder Guidelines G, J, and E in my whole-person analysis. Overall, the record evidence \nleaves me with questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a \nsecurity clearance. \nUnder the whole person concept, I credit Applicant\u2019s decorated military service, \nincluding in combat, on multiple deployments to Iraq and Afghanistan. I also credit his \nexcellent work record and his efforts to come to grips with his ongoing alcohol issues. \nBut Applicant\u2019s alcohol-related offenses are simply too numerous, too similar, and too \nrecent to warrant a finding that they are mitigated. At the close of the record, he \nremained on probation for two recent offense, which occurred after the SOR. His \nfalsifications and lack of candor about his record significantly undercut the credibility of \nhis assertions that he is rehabilitated. The risk of recurrence is too great at this time for \nhim to overcome. He needs to establish a significant, sustained track record of \nabstinence or modified consumption, supported by appropriate counseling or treatment, \nas well as a considerable track record of compliance with the law before he can again \nbe considered a suitable candidate for access to classified information. Applicant did not \nmitigate the personal conduct, alcohol involvement or criminal conduct security \nconcerns. \nDuring closing argument, Applicant requested consideration of a conditional \nclearance, under DOD Directive 5220.6, Enclosure 2, Appendix C. (Tr. 156-157. \nGovernment Counsel noted his opposition (Tr. 161) and I noted Applicant\u2019s ongoing \nprobationary status. (Tr. 161-162) In addition, Applicant already received a conditional \nclearance from the Army CAF in 2012, and has had multiple alcohol-related offenses in \nthe years since then. A conditional clearance is not warranted. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n16 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nParagraph 1, Guideline G:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.d: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.e:  \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.f-1.h:  \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:   \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 2.a-2.d: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 2.e:  \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 3, Guideline J:   \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 3.a:  \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance.

In his answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted \nusing cocaine and marijuana once each in June 2017. He denied that he had access to \nclassified information in June 2017. Applicant\u2019s security clearance application (SCA) \nestablished that he was granted access to classified information in 2008. Applicant\u2019s \nsecurity manager authored an email in March 2021, stating that Applicant had \u201caccess \nwith a clearance for [his employer] from 8/19/2008 through 10/12/2009 when he was \ndowngraded as no longer requiring a clearance for his job duties.\u201d The Government \nproduced a document from the Defense Information System for Security (DISS) \nshowing that as of December 1, 2021, Applicant held a security clearance. While \nApplicant may not have had current access to classified information, he continued to \npossess a security clearance and could have been granted access at any time. (GE 1, \n2; SOR answer) \nIn June 2017, Applicant met a woman (W1) at a bar. He did not know W1 before \nmeeting her on this occasion. The two of them went back to her house. A female friend \n(W2) of W1\u2019s came to her house and brought cocaine with her. W2 laid the cocaine out \non a coffee table. Applicant recalled that W2 snorted a line of cocaine, but he was not \nsure if W1 did as well. The women then offered him cocaine, but he refused. The two \nwomen then left the room and Applicant placed a small amount of cocaine on his finger \nand tasted it using his tongue. Applicant claimed he did not like the taste of it and he did \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nnot ingest anymore of it. His explanation for trying the cocaine was to satisfy his \ncuriosity about it. He claimed he never encountered W1 again after that night. Applicant \nclaimed that he has not used cocaine since this incident and he has no intent to use \ncocaine in the future. (Tr. 20-22, 40; SOR answer; GE 1; AE B-C) \nLater, in the same month, Applicant spent the night at a friend\u2019s house in the \nevent he drank alcohol during the evening. The friend produced a marijuana pipe and \napparently told Applicant that using marijuana helped him sleep. Applicant claimed that \nhe smoked one puff of marijuana, that it did not agree with him, and he did not use any \nmore. He claimed he used the marijuana because he was curious about it based upon \nhis friend\u2019s reference to using it to help him sleep. He claims he has not used marijuana \nsince that time and has no intention of using it in the future. He regularly associates with \nthe friend who provided the marijuana by socializing with him every week or two. (Tr. \n24-25, 43; SOR Answer; GE 1, 3; AE B-C \nApplicant admitted using marijuana previously in 1999 when he was in the Army \nand while he held a security clearance. He claimed he used it while on leave. Since this \nuse of marijuana was not alleged in the SOR, I will not use it for disqualification \npurposes, but I may use it in assessing Applicant\u2019s credibility, in applying any mitigating \nconditions, and in my whole-person analysis. Applicant\u2019s initial admission to this \nmarijuana use came in his 2008 SCA, where he also stated, \u201cI have not used marijuana \nsince that time and I don\u2019t intend to use in the future.\u201d (Tr. 36-37; GE 2-3) \nAs part of his on-boarding process with his employer in 2008, Applicant was \nrequired to take a drug test, which produced a negative result. He has not been drug-\ntested by his employer since that pre-employment test. He provided copies of self-\nprocured drug-test results from January 2021 and October 2021. Both tests showed \nnegative results for marijuana and cocaine, as well as other illicit drugs. Applicant \nadmitted knowing his use of cocaine in 2017 was illegal. During cross-examination, \nwhen asked about the illegality of his marijuana use in 2017, Applicant stated that he \njust knew it was legal under state law. He admitted that from 2008 he was generally \naware of his employer\u2019s no-drug-use policy. (Tr. 34-35, 41, 45-46; AE A) \nApplicant listed both his 2017 cocaine and marijuana uses on his January 2019 \nSCA. He also revealed those uses to a defense investigator during his background \ninterview in July 2019. He did not reveal these uses to his employer until after reporting \nit on his SCA in January 2019. (Tr. 25, 39; GE 1, 3; AE C) \nIn March 2021, Applicant underwent a self-procured substance-abuse evaluation \nby a licensed clinical social worker and certified substance abuse counselor, Ms. B. The \nevaluation consisted of an interview, a standardized drug assessment screening test, \nand a review of the SOR. Using the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental\nDisorders, 5th  Edition (DSM-5), Ms. B opined that Applicant presented with \u201cno use \ndisorder\u201d and further opined that \u201cno treatment was warranted.\u201d In her evaluation report,\nMs. B did not address Applicant\u2019s 1999 marijuana use while holding a security \n \n \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nclearance, or his pledge not to use marijuana in the future stated in his 2008 SCA. (GE \n2-3; AE C) \nApplicant offered character letters from five acquaintances, three current or \nformer coworkers with his current employer and two other professional associates. They \ndiscussed his good character, trustworthiness, job knowledge, honesty, reliability, and \nintegrity. Several recommended the granting of his security clearance. None of the \nstatements referenced that the authors knew about Applicant\u2019s use of cocaine and \nmarijuana while holding a security clearance. One author stated, \u201cIt is imperative to me \nto not be associated with someone against my morals, one of them being anyone who \npartakes in the use of drugs. [Applicant] is not that person.\u201d (AE L) \nApplicant offered his job performance appraisals for years 2017-2020. They \nreflected overall ratings of \u201cachieved/substantially achieved\u201d for 2017, 2018, and 2020; \nand \u201cexceeded\u201d for 2019. As stated above, he also offered a written statement, from \nNovember 2021, expressing that he had no intentions to use illegal substances in the \nfuture. Applicant also offered his DD-214, showing his honorable discharge, his military \ntraining certificates, his job awards, and his college transcripts. (AE B, E, H, M, O-Q) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG 2(a), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. \nUnder Directive section E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to \nestablish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive section E3.1.15, an \n\u201capplicant is responsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \nextenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, \nand has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk that an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline H, Drug Involvement and Substance Abuse \nAG \u00b6 24 expresses the security concern pertaining to drug involvement: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual's reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior \nmay lead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. Controlled substance means any \"controlled substance\" \nas defined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term \nadopted in this guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above. \nIn addition to the above matters, I note that the Director of National Intelligence \n(DNI) issued an October 25, 2014 memorandum concerning adherence to federal laws \nprohibiting marijuana use. In doing so, the DNI emphasized three things. First, no state \ncan authorize violations of federal law, including violations of the Controlled Substances \nAct, which identifies marijuana as a Schedule I controlled drug. Second, changes to \nstate law (and the laws of the District of Columbia) concerning marijuana use do not \nalter the national security adjudicative guidelines. And third, a person\u2019s disregard of \nfederal law concerning the use, sale, or manufacture of marijuana remains relevant \nwhen making eligibility decisions for sensitive national security positions. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 25 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. Those that are potentially applicable in this case include: \n(a) any substance misuse; and \n(f) any illegal drug use while granted access to classified information or \nholding a sensitive position. \nIn June 2017, Applicant used cocaine and marijuana one time each. I find both of \nthe above disqualifying conditions apply. \nAG \u00b6 26 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. Two \npotentially apply in this case: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this \nproblem, and has established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not \nlimited to: \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; \nand \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug\ninvolvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that any future \ninvolvement or misuse is grounds for revocation of national security \neligibility; and  \n \n(d) satisfactory completion of a prescribed drug treatment program, \nincluding, but not limited to, rehabilitation and aftercare requirements, \nwithout recurrence of abuse, and a favorable prognosis by a duly qualified \nmedical professional. \nApplicant\u2019s marijuana use was infrequent and occurred over three years ago, \nhowever, there are two troubling aspects about his actions that go straight to the heart \nof his reliability, trustworthiness, and his willingness to comply with laws, rules, and \nregulations. First, when he revealed his 1999 use of marijuana in 2008, he pledged not \nto use it again. He broke that pledge with his 2017 use of marijuana and cocaine. \nSecond, both of these uses were when he was aware of his employer\u2019s drug-free policy \nand after he was granted a security clearance in 2008. Even, if we believe he did not \nhold an active clearance in 2017, he was fully aware of his duties not to use illegal \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n       \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nsubstances as an employee of this defense contractor, from his time holding an active \nclearance in 2008, and from his days holding an active clearance in the Army. For these \nreasons. AG \u00b6 26(a) does not fully apply. \nApplicant acknowledged his use of both marijuana and cocaine in 2017. He \nexplained those uses as allowing his curiosity to get the better of him. In 2017, he was \n37 years old and a veteran of military service, who had experimented with marijuana \nwhen he was 19 years old. His claim of acting because of his curiosity lacks credibility. \nOne thing Applicant offers to overcome his past actions is his pledge not to use illegal \ndrugs in the future. However, based upon his past broken pledge from 2008, that is not \na reliable option. He remains in weekly contact with his friend who supplied him with the \nmarijuana. While, he received a substance abuse evaluation, there is no evidence of his \ncompletion of a drug treatment program. AG \u00b6\u00b6 26(b) and AG 26(d) do not fully apply. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guideline and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I considered Applicant\u2019s negative \ndrug tests, his written statement of intent not to use illegal drugs in the future, his \nsubstance abuse evaluation conducted by Ms. B, his military service, his education, his \nletters of recommendation, and his job performance appraisals and awards. However, I \nalso considered that he used both cocaine and marijuana in 2017, while holding a \nsecurity clearance and while fully aware he was violating federal law and the no-drug \npolicy of his employer. I also considered that in 2008 Applicant pledged not to use \nmarijuana in the future, but he broke that pledge with his use in 2017, thereby \nundercutting his reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact In his SOR answer, Applicant admitted all the allegations. His admissions are adopted as a findings of fact. After a review of the pleadings and evidence, I make the following additional findings of fact. Applicant is a 40-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He began working at his present job in April 2016. He served in the U.S. Air Force and the Air National Guard for approximately six years. He received an honorable discharge. He holds a bachelor\u2019s degree. He was married from 2010 to 2016. He has three minor children, for whom he pays child support. He has never missed a payment, even though it has caused him to miss some of his other financial obligations. (Tr. 6, 18-19, 23-24, 34, 36; GE 1) The SOR alleged Applicant failed to file his 2011 state income tax return and that a state tax lien was entered against him in 2016 for $5,201. The SOR also alleged five collection accounts and two charged-off debts (student loans, an automobile repossession, and consumer debts) totaling approximately $73,780. The debts are established by credit reports from June 2018, August 2019, and April 2021, and November 2021; Appellant\u2019s SOR admissions; and his hearing testimony. (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a \u2013 1.i). (Tr. 19; GE 4-7) Applicant explained that his financial troubles began when he got divorced and he was required to pay spousal and child support that essentially amounted to half of his pay check.

DOHA received the hearing transcript (Tr.) \non December 1, 2021. \nFindings of Fact \nIn his SOR answer, Applicant admitted all the allegations. His admissions are \nadopted as a findings of fact. After a review of the pleadings and evidence, I make the \nfollowing additional findings of fact. \nApplicant is a 40-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He began working \nat his present job in April 2016. He served in the U.S. Air Force and the Air National \nGuard for approximately six years. He received an honorable discharge. He holds a \nbachelor\u2019s degree. He was married from 2010 to 2016. He has three minor children, for \nwhom he pays child support. He has never missed a payment, even though it has \ncaused him to miss some of his other financial obligations. (Tr. 6, 18-19, 23-24, 34, 36; \nGE 1) \nThe SOR alleged Applicant failed to file his 2011 state income tax return and that \na state tax lien was entered against him in 2016 for $5,201. The SOR also alleged five \ncollection accounts and two charged-off debts (student loans, an automobile \nrepossession, and consumer debts) totaling approximately $73,780. The debts are \nestablished by credit reports from June 2018, August 2019, and April 2021, and \nNovember 2021; Appellant\u2019s SOR admissions; and his hearing testimony. (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a \n\u2013 1.i). (Tr. 19; GE 4-7) \nApplicant explained that his financial troubles began when he got divorced and \nhe was required to pay spousal and child support that essentially amounted to half of \nhis pay check. The spousal support ended in February 2021, but his child-support \npayments continued at $1,800 per month. In July 2021, his ex-wife agreed to accept \n$500 monthly child support in exchange for Applicant having custody of the children \nevery weekend. His daughter also has special needs. Applicant provided documentation \nshowing that he has made four payments of $300 toward his state tax debt. Those \npayments were all after the SOR was issued (August 2021, October 20121, November \n2021, and December 2021). He claims he filed his 2011 state tax return, but provided \nno documentation to corroborate his assertion. (Tr. 19-20, 27; AE D) \nApplicant has not made payments toward any of the remaining debts, nor has he \nset up any types of plans to address the debts. He contacted a credit-repair company, \nbut the company has not addressed any of his delinquent debts. His student loan debts \nwere acquired before he enlisted in the Air Force and have been delinquent since \nAugust 2019. (Tr. 27, 29, 31, 33, 35; AE B) \nApplicant also admitted in his testimony that he has not filed his state income tax \nreturns \"in the last few years\u201d and that he failed to file his federal tax returns for 2018, \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n2019, and 2020. I will not consider this information for disqualification purposes, but I \nmay consider it to determine credibility, the applicability of mitigating conditions, and \nduring my whole-person analysis. Applicant\u2019s current yearly gross income is \napproximately $88,000. (Tr. 29-30, 33) \nApplicant supplied a letter from a coworker, who wrote that Applicant is a good \nman and good father. (AE C) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(a), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk that an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n3 \n\n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nAG \u00b6 18 expresses the security concern for financial considerations: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. I have \nconsidered all of them under AG \u00b6 19 and the following potentially apply: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts;  \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired. \nApplicant accumulated numerous delinquent debts, which remain unpaid or \nunresolved. He also failed to file his 2011 state income tax return or pay the taxes \nowed. I find all the above disqualifying conditions are raised. \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns \narising from financial difficulties. I have considered all of the mitigating conditions under \nAG \u00b6 20 and the following potentially apply: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control; and \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts;  \n \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax \nauthority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \nApplicant\u2019s debts are recent and, although he communicated with a company to \nrepair his credit, he offered no proof that he paid or resolved his debts, other than \nmaking four post-SOR payments toward his state tax debt. He failed to produce \nevidence showing that recurrence of his financial problems is unlikely. AG \u00b6 20(a) is not \napplicable. \nWhile his divorce was a condition beyond his control and he has acted \nresponsibly by making his child support payments, he has not acted responsibly in \nignoring his remaining debts. AG \u00b6 20(b) is partially applicable. \nAside from his contact with a credit-repair company, Applicant did not present \nevidence of financial counseling. He failed to establish good-faith efforts to resolve his \ndebts. Given the unpaid status of his debts, Applicant\u2019s financial problems are not under \ncontrol. AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(c) and AG 20(d) do not apply. Appellant only receives partial credit for \nhis state tax payments because he did not start until after the SOR was issued. AG \u00b6 \n20(g) has some application. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n       \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guideline and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nrelevant facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 \n2(d) were addressed under that guideline, but some warrant additional comment. \nI considered Applicant\u2019s military and federal contractor service and the \ncircumstances surrounding his indebtedness. However, I also considered that he has \nmade insufficient and untimely efforts to resolve his debts. Additionally, he admitted not \nfiling his federal and state tax returns for the last several years. He has not established \na meaningful track record of financial responsibility, which causes me to question his \nability to resolve his debts. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant has not mitigated the financial considerations security concerns. (I \nconsidered the exceptions under Security Executive Agent Directive (SEAD) 4, \nAppendix C, dated June 8, 2017, and determined they are not applicable in this case.) \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs: 1.a-1.i: \nAgainst Applicant \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

(HE \n2) On July 4, 2021, Applicant provided a response to the SOR and requested a hearing. \n(HE 3) On August 16, 2021, Department Counsel was ready to proceed.    \nOn January 5, 2022, the case was assigned to me. On January 26, 2022, the \nDefense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a notice of hearing, setting the \nhearing for February 24, 2022. (HE 1) The hearing was held as scheduled. \nDepartment Counsel offered three exhibits into evidence, and Applicant offered \none exhibit. (Transcript (Tr.) 14-16; GE 1-GE 3; Applicant Exhibit (AE) A) There were no \nobjections, and all proffered exhibits were admitted into evidence. (Tr. 15-16) On March \n3, 2022, DOHA received a transcript of the hearing. The record was held open until March \n7, 2022, to enable Applicant to provide documentation. (Tr. 23, 52) No post-hearing \ndocumentation was received. \nSome details were excluded to protect Applicant\u2019s right to privacy. Specific \ninformation is available in the cited exhibits and transcript. \nFindings of Fact \nIn Applicant\u2019s SOR response, he admitted the SOR allegations in \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through \n1.e, and he denied the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.a through 2.f. (HE 3) He also provided \nmitigating information. His admissions are accepted as findings of fact. Additional findings \nfollow. \nApplicant is a 42-year-old research scientist who is working for a defense \ncontractor. (Tr. 6; GE 1) In 1998, he graduated from high school. (Tr. 6, 26) In 2004, he \nreceived a bachelor\u2019s degree in sociology; in 2005, he received a bachelor\u2019s degree in \nnatural resource management; and in 2010, he was awarded a master\u2019s degree in \nforestry. (Tr. 6-7) He has not served in the military. (GE 1 at 21) In 2017, he married, and \nhe has a two-year-old son. (Tr. 7-8) \nDrug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.c, and 1.d allege, and Applicant admitted that he purchased and \nused marijuana and/or THC-infused CBD edibles with varying frequency from about \nAugust 2010 to about March 2019. This includes marijuana use while a federal \ngovernment employee from August 2010 to August 2012. \nApplicant used marijuana from about 1997 until 2020. (Tr. 18, 21) When he was in \ncollege, he smoked marijuana on about a weekly basis. (Tr. 18-19) He usually purchased \nthe marijuana he used. (Tr. 19) In August 2010, he began his federal government \nemployment. (Tr. 20) In 2020, he reduced his marijuana use to about once a month.

(Tr. 22, 24) He learned there was no \ndrug testing at his federal government employment, and he decided to resume his \nmarijuana possession and use. (Tr. 23) He worked for a university from September 2012 \nto February of 2016. (Tr. 23) At his hearing, he claimed that in late 2011 or early 2012, \nhe stopped using marijuana again because he was looking for new employment, and he \ndid not possess and use marijuana until late 2015 or early 2016. (Tr. 23-26) \nIn July 2017, Applicant started his current employment, and since early 2018, he \nhas been eating THC-infused CBD edibles, which he purchased from marijuana \ndispensaries. (Tr. 27) His most recent use of a THC-infused CBD was in August or \nSeptember 2020. (Tr. 33-34, 43; SOR response at 2) He is aware that the THC content \nof the CBD gummies he consumes exceeds the Department of Agriculture authorized \nlevel for hemp products of .3 percent. (Tr. 28-29, 49) As such, his possession and \nconsumption of his THC-infused CBD gummies violated federal restrictions. See Joint \nBase \nSan \nAntonio \nwebsite, \nCBD \nin \nthe \nDOD, \nhttps://www.jbsa.mil/Portals/102/CBD PA%20Visual%20Aid.pdf. \nSOR \u00b6 1.e alleges and Applicant admitted that he used a prescription opioid \nwithout a prescription in August 2019. He used his spouse\u2019s prescription opioid twice \nwhen he had a painful molar and a painful knee. (Tr. 35) \nAs to his history of illegal drug use, Applicant said in a written statement submitted \nat his hearing: \nSimply put, since my professional career started in 2006, I have never \nallowed drug use to be a limiting factor in my employability or professional \nadvancement. If I\u2019m unable to use due to my employment status or (as of \nlate) if I cannot acquire recreational CBD or THC products from a state-\nsanctioned dispensary, I simply refrain from using. (AE A) \nAs for his future use of illegal drugs, Applicant said: \nSo I'm [an] adult now with a kid and a mortgage. I don\u2019t need to use CBD \nproducts or anything really, and I haven\u2019t. Once again, it\u2019s not a big deal. \nAnd if it\u2019s going to affect my employment, I can\u2019t risk even 5 percent of my \njob and my son and my mortgage and everything. I\u2019m risk averse and I can\u2019t. \n(Tr. 48) \nPersonal Conduct \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.a through 2.d allege Applicant failed to fully disclose on his March 17, \n2019 SCA the information in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.e concerning his marijuana \npossession and use, his consumption of THC-infused CBD gummies, and his abuse of a \n3 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nprescription opioid.

(Tr. 37) He said he did not have \u201cvivid memories of using \nregularly.\u201d (Tr. 40) When he answered the question on his SCA about drug use, he may \nhave been downplaying his drug use. (Tr. 46) He conceded that sometimes he used \nmarijuana outside these \u201climited parameters.\u201d (SOR response at 2) \nApplicant disclosed for the first time during his August 26, 2019 Office of Personnel \nManagement (OPM) interview that he used his spouse\u2019s opioid prescription twice to treat \nhis painful tooth and knee. He indicated he wanted to be fully transparent about his opioid \nuse. (Tr. 35-37; GE 3) \nSOR \u00b6 2.e alleges Applicant failed to disclose on his September 7, 2010 SCA the \ninformation in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b, and 1.c about his marijuana and/or THC-infused CBD \nuse. In 2010, Applicant was applying for federal government employment. He said he \nintentionally answered no to the questions about marijuana possession and use during \nthe previous seven years because he \u201cwanted to ensure [he] received the job\u201d and he \nwanted to \u201censure [his] employability.\u201d (Tr. 22; AE A at 1) However, in his SOR response, \nhe claimed the omission of his marijuana involvement was unintentional and an oversight. \n(SOR response at 3) \nSOR \u00b6 2.f cross alleges the drug involvement in SOR \u00b6 1.b while he was a federal \ngovernment employee as a personal conduct security concern. \nDuring his August 26, 2019 OPM interview, Applicant said he smoked marijuana \nthree or four times a week when he was in college from 1998 to 2003. (GE 1 at 12-13; \nGE 3 at 7) He used marijuana once a week from 2008 to 2010 while he was attending \nthe university where he received his master\u2019s degree. (GE 1 at 13; GE 3 at 7) From 2012 \nto 2015, while employed at another university, he used marijuana on a weekly basis, \nmostly at home. (GE 1 at 14; GE 3 at 7) From 2016 to 2017, he used marijuana two or \nthree times a week. (GE 1 at 9-10; GE 3 at 7) \nFrom 2017 to 2019, Applicant used marijuana once or twice a week. (GE 1 at 9; \nGE 3 at 7) He reduced the frequency of his marijuana use from 2017 to 2019 because \nthe state where he was residing had not legalized the purchase of marijuana. (GE 3 at 7) \nFrom 2017 to 2019, he purchased marijuana in the state where he lived from 2016 to \n2017 because marijuana sales were legalized in that state. (Id.) \nApplicant\u2019s descriptions of his history of marijuana use during his OPM interview \nindicated significantly more extensive marijuana use than he described at his hearing. \n(Tr. 29-30) At his hearing, he explained that at his OPM interview, he was trying to show \n4 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nthat he was candid and open, and he was not as careful about accuracy as during his \nsubsequent statement in response to the SOR and at his hearing.

(Id.) \nPolicies \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the Executive \nBranch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security emphasizing, \n\u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. \n518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to control \naccess to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual \nis sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The President \nhas authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicant\u2019s eligibility for \naccess to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \nIndustry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nabout potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Clearance \ndecisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a \ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 7. \nThus, nothing in this decision should be construed to suggest that it is based, in whole or \nin part, on any express or implied determination about applicant\u2019s allegiance, loyalty, or \npatriotism. It is merely an indication the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the \nPresident, Secretary of Defense, and Director of National Intelligence have established \nfor issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro.

An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it \nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d \nISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). The burden of disproving a \nmitigating condition never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 \n(App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if they must, \non the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b).  \nAnalysis \nDrug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nAG \u00b6 24 provides the security concern arising from drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse stating: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior may \nlead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises questions \nabout a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, and \nregulations. Controlled substance means any \u201ccontrolled substance\u201d as \ndefined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term adopted in \nthis guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above. \nAG \u00b6 25 provides conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying in this case: \u201c(a) any substance misuse (see above definition)\u201d; \u201c(c) illegal \npossession of a controlled substance. . . .\u201d; and \u201c(f) any illegal drug use while granted \naccess to classified information or holding a sensitive position.\u201d The record establishes \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 25(a) and 25(c). It is unclear if Applicant\u2019s federal government employment in SOR \n\u00b6 1.b constituted \u201ca sensitive position\u201d; therefore, AG \u00b6 25(f) is not established. Additional \ninformation is contained in the mitigation section, infra. \nAG \u00b6 26 lists four conditions that could mitigate security concerns: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened\nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt\non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n \n6 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and substance \nmisuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and \nhas established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not limited to: \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; and \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that any future\ninvolvement or misuse is grounds for revocation of national security\neligibility; \n \n \n(c) abuse of prescription drugs was after a severe or prolonged illness \nduring which these drugs were prescribed, and abuse has since ended; and \n(d) satisfactory completion of a prescribed drug treatment program, \nincluding, but not limited to, rehabilitation and aftercare requirements, \nwithout recurrence of abuse, and a favorable prognosis by a duly qualified \nmedical professional. \nIn ISCR Case No. 10-04641 at 4 (App. Bd. Sept. 24, 2013), the DOHA Appeal \nBoard concisely explained Applicant\u2019s responsibility for proving the applicability of \nmitigating conditions as follows: \nOnce a concern arises regarding an Applicant\u2019s security clearance \neligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance of \na security clearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th \nCir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991). After the Government \npresents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the \napplicant to rebut or mitigate those concerns. See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. The \nstandard applicable in security clearance decisions is that articulated in \nEgan, supra. \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access \nto classified information will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nDirective, Enclosure 2, [App. A] \u00b6 2(b).   \nNone of the mitigating conditions fully apply; however, Applicant provided some \nimportant mitigating information. He has made some positive lifestyle changes: moved to \na different state; married; has a son; and made a commitment to not use marijuana in the \nfuture. He voluntarily disclosed his marijuana possession and use during his OPM \ninterview. \nThe evidence against mitigation is more persuasive at this time. In ISCR Case No. \n16-03460 at 4 (App. Bd. May 24, 2018), the applicant had a history of marijuana use, and \nthe Appeal Board said: \n7 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nA clearance adjudication is aimed at determining if an applicant has the \nrequisite judgment and reliability to abide by rules designed to protect \nclassified information. . . . [Security concerns arise if] there is doubt as to \nwhether he [or she] will follow the regulatory requirements for handling \nclassified information, which might, in the event, appear burdensome. \nAccess to national secrets entails a fiduciary duty to the U.S. A person who \nenters into such a fiduciary relationship is charged with abiding by legal and \nregulatory guidance regardless of whether he or she believes that guidance \nto be wise. \nPossession of a Schedule I controlled substance is a federal criminal offense. \nSchedules I, II, III, IV, and V, as referred to in the Controlled Substances Act are contained \nin 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 812(c). Marijuana is a Schedule I controlled substance. See Drug \nEnforcement Administration listing at http://www.deadiversion.usdoj.gov/21cfr/cfr/1308/ \n1308 11.htm. See also Gonzales v. Raish, 545 U.S. 1 (2005) (discussing placement of \nmarijuana on Schedule I). \nThe Director of National Intelligence (DNI) Memorandum ES 2014-00674, \n\u201cAdherence to Federal Laws Prohibiting Marijuana Use,\u201d October 25, 2014, states: \n[C]hanges to state laws and the laws of the District of Columbia pertaining \nto marijuana use do not alter the existing National Security Adjudicative \nGuidelines . . . . An individual\u2019s disregard of federal law pertaining to the \nuse, sale, or manufacture of marijuana remains adjudicatively relevant in \nnational security determinations. As always, adjudicative authorities are \nexpected to evaluate claimed or developed use of, or involvement with, \nmarijuana using the current adjudicative criteria. The adjudicative authority \nmust determine if the use of, or involvement with, marijuana raises \nquestions about the individual\u2019s judgment, reliability, trustworthiness, and \nwillingness to comply with law, rules, and regulations, including federal \nlaws, when making eligibility decisions of persons proposed for, or \noccupying, sensitive national security positions. \nSee ISCR Case No. ISCR Case No. 20-01772 (App. Bd. Sept. 14, 2021) (noting \ncontinued relevance of October 15, 2014 DNI Memorandum in the application of \nGuideline H for marijuana cases). \nDuring his August 26, 2019 OPM interview, Applicant said he smoked marijuana \nthree or four times a week when he was in college from 1998 to 2003. He used marijuana \nonce a week from 2008 to 2010 while he was attending the university where he received \nhis master\u2019s degree. From 2012 to 2015, while employed at another university, he used \nmarijuana on a weekly basis, mostly at home. From 2016 to 2017, he used marijuana two \nor three times a week. \nApplicant\u2019s marijuana use before August 2010 and after March 2019 was not \nalleged in the SOR. Applicant\u2019s description of the frequency of his marijuana use at his \nhearing was substantially less than he described during his OPM interview.

Mar. 9, 2022) (citing ISCR Case No. 15-07369 at 3 (App. Bd. Aug. 16, \n2017)). The non-SOR allegations will not be considered except for the four purposes \ndescribed in ISCR Case No. 20-02787 at 4 (App. Bd. Mar. 9, 2022).  \nApplicant used THC-infused CBD in August or September 2020, which was after \nhe completed his March 17, 2019 SCA. \u201cAn applicant who uses marijuana after having \nbeen placed on notice of its security significance, such as using after having completed \na clearance application, may be lacking in the qualities expected of those with access to \nnational secrets.\u201d ISCR Case No. 17-03191 at 3 (App. Bd. Mar. 26, 2019) (citing ISCR \nCase No. 17-04198 at 2 (App. Bd. Jan. 15, 2019) (\u201cAn applicant\u2019s misuse of drugs after \nhaving been placed on notice of the incompatibility of drug abuse with clearance eligibility \nraises questions about his or her judgment and reliability\u201d)). \nApplicant consumed THC-infused CBD gummies as recently as August or \nSeptember 2020. He did not describe any drug-abuse counseling or treatment. At his \nhearing in February 2022, he indicated he does not plan or intend to use CBD and/or \nmarijuana in the future; however, I have lingering concerns about his future marijuana \npossession and use. Guideline H security concerns are not mitigated at this time. \nPersonal Conduct \nAG \u00b6 15 explains why personal conduct is a security concern stating: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. \nAG \u00b6 16 lists conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying including: \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar \nform used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, \naward benefits or status, determine national security eligibility or \ntrustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities.  \n9 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n     \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n      \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant intentionally failed to disclose his illegal marijuana possession and use \non his September 7, 2010 SCA because he wanted to improve his chances of obtaining \nemployment. In his SCA response, he said he intentionally failed to disclose this \ninformation on his SCA to improve his employment opportunities. AG \u00b6 16(a) applies to \nSOR \u00b6 2.e. His claim on his SCA response that he inadvertently failed to disclose his \nmarijuana possession and use on this SCA is not credible. \nApplicant made a misleading and factually incorrect statement on his March 17, \n2019 SCA about limiting his marijuana involvement to states where marijuana possession \nwas legalized. \n\u201cApplicant\u2019s statements about his intent and state of mind when he executed his \nSecurity Clearance Application were relevant evidence, but they were not binding on the \nAdministrative Judge.\u201d ISCR Case No. 04-09488 at 2 (App. Bd. Nov. 29, 2006) (citation \nomitted). In ADP Case No. 17-03932 at 3 (App. Bd. Feb. 14, 2019) the Appeal Board \nrecognized the importance of circumstantial evidence of intent in falsification cases: \nWhen evaluating the deliberate nature of an alleged falsification, a Judge \nshould consider the applicant\u2019s mens rea in light of the entirety of the record \nevidence. See, e.g., ADP Case No. 15-07979 at 5 (App. Bd. May 30, 2017). \nAs a practical matter, a finding regarding an applicant\u2019s intent or state of \nmind may not always be based on an applicant\u2019s statements, but rather may \nrely on circumstantial evidence. Id. \nApplicant\u2019s most accurate statement about his marijuana involvement was during \nhis OPM interview. He described hundreds of possessions and uses of marijuana to the \nOPM investigator. The record evidence establishes AG \u00b6 16(a) in relation to SOR \u00b6 2.b. \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.a and 2.c are essentially duplications of the allegation in SOR \u00b6 2.b, and I find \nfor Applicant for SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.a and 2.c, and against him for SOR \u00b6 2.b. \nSOR \u00b6 2.d alleges Applicant failed to list his use of his spouse\u2019s opioid medication \nto address pain from his molar and knee on two occasions on his March 17, 2019 SCA. I \nfind for Applicant for SOR \u00b6 2.d because Applicant did not think of his prescription abuse \nat the time he was completing his SCA. It is reasonable for him to overlook his misuse of \na prescription drug on two occasions because he was focused on addressing his \nextensive history of marijuana use when he completed his 2019 SCA. \nAG \u00b6 16 has three disqualifying conditions that are relevant in this case to \nassessment of SOR \u00b6 2.f. AG \u00b6\u00b6 16(c), 16(d)(3), and 16(e)(1) read: \n(c) credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is \nnot sufficient for an adverse determination under any other single guideline, \nbut which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-person \nassessment of questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack \nof candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations, or other \ncharacteristics indicating that the person may not properly safeguard \nprotected information; \n10 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(d) credible adverse information that is not explicitly covered under any \nother guideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an adverse \ndetermination, but which, when combined with all available information \nsupports a whole-person assessment of questionable judgment, \nuntrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with \nrules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that the person may \nnot properly safeguard protected information. This includes but is not limited \nto consideration of:  . . . (3) a pattern of dishonesty or rule violations; and \n(e) personal conduct, or concealment of information about one's conduct, \nthat creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress, such as \n(1) engaging in activities which, if known, may affect the person's personal, \nprofessional, or community standing . . . . \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 16(c) and 16(d)(3) do not apply to the allegation in SOR \u00b6 2.f. As indicated \nin the previous section, Guideline H is the most appropriate guideline for Applicant\u2019s \nmarijuana possession and use. The Guideline H discussion indicates sufficient evidence \nfor an adverse determination. Personal conduct security concerns are refuted with \nrespect to SOR \u00b6 2.f. \nAG \u00b6 17 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns in this case: \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; \n(b) the refusal or failure to cooperate, omission, or concealment was caused \nor significantly contributed to by advice of legal counsel or of a person with \nprofessional responsibilities for advising or instructing the individual \nspecifically concerning security processes. Upon being made aware of the \nrequirement to cooperate or provide the information, the individual \ncooperated fully and truthfully; \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, \nunreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to \nrecur; \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate vulnerability \nto exploitation, manipulation, or duress; and \n11 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n     \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(f) the information was unsubstantiated or from a source of questionable \nreliability. \nNone of the mitigating conditions fully apply to Applicant\u2019s failure to disclose his \nmarijuana possession and use on his September 7, 2010 SCA and to his failure to fully \ndisclose his marijuana and THC-infused CBD possession and use on his March 17, 2019 \nSCA. His false statements on his SCAs and his failure to fully describe his marijuana \ninvolvement at his hearing continue to cast doubt on his reliability, trustworthiness, and \ngood judgment. Personal conduct security concerns are not mitigated. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), \u201c[t]he ultimate determination\u201d of whether to grant a security \nclearance \u201cmust be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines\u201d and the whole-person concept. My comments under Guideline H and E \nare incorporated in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were \naddressed under that guideline but some warrant additional comment. \nApplicant is a 42-year-old research scientist who is working for a defense \ncontractor. In 2004, he received a bachelor\u2019s degree in sociology; in 2005, he received a \nbachelor\u2019s degree in natural resource management; and in 2010, he was awarded a \nmaster\u2019s degree in forestry. In 2017, he married, and he has a two-year-old son. \nApplicant\u2019s most accurate description of his marijuana history was to an OPM \ninvestigator. He did not provide accurate and complete information about his marijuana \npossession and use on his SCAs and at his hearing. An honest and candid self-report of \ndrug abuse is an important indication that, if granted security clearance eligibility, the \nindividual would disclose any threats to national security, even if the disclosure involves \nan issue that might damage his or her own career or personal reputation. Moreover, the \nmitigating weight of Applicant\u2019s disclosures is undermined by his THC-infused CBD \nconsumption as recently as August or September 2020 after submission of his March 17, \n2019 SCA. He indicated he did not plan or intend to use marijuana or THC-infused CBD \n12 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n______________________ \nin the future; however, his lack of credibility in his hearing statement undermines his \npromises to comply with drug-related federal law in the future. \nIt is well settled that once a concern arises regarding an applicant\u2019s security \nclearance eligibility, there is a strong presumption against granting a security clearance. \nSee Dorfmont, 913 F. 2d at 1401. \u201c[A] favorable clearance decision means that the record \ndiscloses no basis for doubt about an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified \ninformation.\u201d ISCR Case No. 18-02085 at 7 (App. Bd.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant denied all the allegations in SOR, except for allegation \u00b6 1.l. After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, I make the following findings of fact. Applicant is a 38-year-old employee of a defense contractor. She has been employed by the defense contractor since 2020. She has held a security clearance, off and on, since joining the Navy at the age of 17. She is married a third time, and has one adult child, and three children, by her second marriage. Applicant attributes her current financial difficulties to the divorce from her second husband. (TR at page 12 line 21 to page 15 line 14, at page 29 line 19 to page 30 line 30 line 6, at page 40 line 22 to page 41 line 9, and at page 42 line 14 to page 43 line 15.) She is receiving credit counseling. (AppXs A and Q.) Guideline F - Financial Considerations 1.a. Applicant denies that she has a past-due debt to Creditor A, as the result of a vehicle repossession, in the amount of about $28,874. She avers that this debt was covered by a bankruptcy filed by her second husband, but has submitted nothing in support of her averment.

The SOR further \ninformed Applicant that, based on information available to the government, DoD \nadjudicators could not make the preliminary affirmative finding it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s security clearance. \nApplicant answered the SOR on June 21, 2021, and requested a hearing before \nan administrative judge. (Answer.) The case was assigned to me on March 21, 2022. \nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a notice of hearing on \nApril 7, 2022, scheduling the hearing for July 7, 2022. The hearing was convened as \nscheduled. The Government offered Exhibits (GXs) 1 through 12, which were admitted \ninto evidence. Applicant testified on her own behalf.

After a \nthorough and careful review of the pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, I make the \nfollowing findings of fact. \nApplicant is a 38-year-old employee of a defense contractor. She has been \nemployed by the defense contractor since 2020. She has held a security clearance, off \nand on, since joining the Navy at the age of 17. She is married a third time, and has one \nadult child, and three children, by her second marriage. Applicant attributes her current \nfinancial difficulties to the divorce from her second husband. (TR at page 12 line 21 to \npage 15 line 14, at page 29 line 19 to page 30 line 30 line 6, at page 40 line 22 to page \n41 line 9, and at page 42 line 14 to page 43 line 15.) She is receiving credit counseling. \n(AppXs A and Q.) \n Guideline F - Financial Considerations \n1.a. Applicant denies that she has a past-due debt to Creditor A, as the result of \na vehicle repossession, in the amount of about $28,874. She avers that this debt was \ncovered by a bankruptcy filed by her second husband, but has submitted nothing in \nsupport of her averment. Applicant also admits to receiving $6,500 as a part of this \ntransaction, which she used \u201cto pay off debt . . . and . . . put money into savings.\u201d (TR at \npage 15 line 19 to page 17 line 6, at page 59 lines 7~23, and at page 77 lines 5~24.) \nThe Government\u2019s June 2019 credit report (CR) does not support Applicant\u2019s testimony, \nbut shows this substantial debt is still past-due. (GX 10 at page 3.) This allegation is \nfound against Applicant. \n1.b. and 1.c. Applicant initially denied that she had past-due debts to Creditor B \nin an amount totaling about $8,525. She thought these debts were included in her \nsecond husband\u2019s bankruptcy, but discovered that they still appeared on her credit \nreports. (GX 10 at page 3 and GX 12 at page 6.) Applicant avers she is making \n\u201c$250.00 [payments] every two weeks,\u201d as corroborated by documentation. (TR at page \n17 line 7 to page 18 line 10, and AppX J.) These allegations are found for Applicant. \n1.d. Applicant denies that she has a past-due debt to Creditor D, as the result of \nanother vehicle repossession, in the amount of about $2,741. Applicant avers that she \ndisputed this debt; but has heard nothing as a result of her dispute. She does admit \u201cit\u2019s \nbeen charged off.\u201d (TR at page 18 line 10 to page 19 line 16, and at page 60 lines \n6~24.) As this past-due debt appears on Applicant\u2019s June 2019 CR; and Applicant has \noffered nothing further in this regard, this allegation is found against Applicant.

Applicant denies that she has a second past-due debt to Creditor A in the \namount of about $1,821. She avers that this debt may have been covered by a \nbankruptcy filed by her second husband, but has submitted nothing in support of her \naverment. (TR at page 19 line 17 to page 20 line 14, and at page 61 lines 1~23.) As this \npast-due debt appears on Applicant\u2019s June 2019 CR, this allegation is found against \nApplicant. (GX 10 at page 4.) \n1.f. Applicant denies that she has a past-due debt to Creditor F in the amount of \nabout $1,810. Applicant avers that she \u201ccould not find any information on this debt.\u201d (TR \nat page 20 line 15 to page 21 line 19.) As this past-due debt appears on Applicant\u2019s \nJune 2019 CR, this allegation is found against Applicant. (GX 10 at page 4.) \n1.g. Applicant initially denied that she had a past-due debt to Creditor G in an \namount totaling about $39. She avers that she \u201cpaid that debt in full,\u201d as corroborated by \ndocumentation. (TR at page 21 line 20 to page 22 line 6, and AppX K.) This allegation is \nfound for Applicant. \n1.h. Applicant denies that she has a past-due debt to Creditor H in the amount of \nabout $2,759. Applicant avers that she is \u201cunaware if it\u2019s on . . . [her] Credit Report.\u201d (TR \nat page 22 line 6 to page 23 line 3, and at page 61 line 24 to page 63 line 14.) As this \npast-due debt appears as a collection account on Applicant\u2019s June 2019 CR, this \nallegation is found against Applicant. (GX 10 at page 11.) \n1.i. Applicant denies that she has a second past-due debt to Creditor G in the \namount of about $2,496. Applicant avers, \u201cthat was another account that I had with my \nhusband. It was charged off for him with his Bankruptcy, I\u2019m assuming.\u201d (TR at page 23 \nlines 4~13.) On cross-examination, Applicant admits that \u201cpart of the debt is\u201d her\u2019s. (TR \nat page 63 line 15 to page 64 line 14.) As this past-due debt appears as a collection \naccount on Applicant\u2019s June 2019 CR, this allegation is found against Applicant. (GX 10 \nat page 11.) \n1.j. Applicant denies that she has a past-due debt to Creditor J in the amount of \nabout $1,338. Applicant avers \u201cthis was another account that I had in my marriage . . . \nand it was charged off, I\u2019m assuming, with his Bankruptcy. But, it\u2019s no longer on [her] \nCredit Report.\u201d (TR at page 23 lines 14~25, and at page 64 line 15 to page 65 line 17.) \nAs this past-due debt appears as a collection account on Applicant\u2019s June 2019 CR, this \nallegation is found against Applicant. (GX 10 at page 11.) \n1.k. and 1.n. Applicant initially denied that she had two past-due debts to Creditor \nK in an amount totaling about $1,113. She has contacted this creditor, and is in \ncompliance with a payment plan agreed to with said creditor. (TR at page 25 lines 1~24, \nand AppX L.) These allegations are found for Applicant. \n1.l. Applicant initially denied that she had a past-due debt to Creditor L in an \namount totaling about $628. She has contacted this creditor, a\n nd is in compliance with a \npayment plan agreed to with said creditor. (TR at page 26 lines 1~22, and AppX B.) \nThis allegation is found for Applicant. \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n1.m.

As this past-due debt appears as a collection account on Applicant\u2019s June 2019 \nCR, this allegation is found against Applicant. (GX 10 at page 12.) \n1.n. Has been discussed, above, with 1.k. \n1.o. Applicant denies that she has a past-due debt to Creditor O in the amount of \nabout $119. Applicant avers \u201cit\u2019s paid off.\u201d (TR at page 27 lines 7~18, and at page 66 \nlines 4~23.) As this past-due debt appears on Applicant\u2019s June 2019 CR; and no \nsupporting documentation has been submitted, this allegation is found against \nApplicant. (GX 10 at page 13.) \n1.p. Applicant initially denied that she had a past-due debt to Creditor P in an \namount totaling about $111. She has contacted this creditor, and settled and paid said \ndebt for $89. (TR at page 27 line 19 to page 28 line 5, and AppX N.) This allegation is \nfound for Applicant. \n1.q. Applicant initially denied that she had a past-due debt to Creditor Q in an \namount totaling about $611. She has contacted this creditor, and paid this debt. (TR at\npage 28 lines 6~14, and AppX N.) This allegation is found for Applicant. \n \n1.r. Applicant initially denied that she was in arrears with her child support \npayments in an amount totaling about $54,240. She has submitted evidence showing \npayments of $253 every two weeks towards her arrearage. (TR at page 28 line 15 to \npage 29 line 3, and AppX P.) This allegation is found for Applicant. \nGuideline E - Personal Conduct \n2.a. On February 9, 2015, Applicant received Non-Judicial Punishment (Article \n15) for violating Articles 92 (Mutiny and Sedition), 17 (False Official Statements), 123a \n(Making, Drawing or Uttering Check, or Order without Sufficient Funds), and 134 \n(General Articles) of the Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ). (GX 7.) Applicant \navers that she was never given, or sought, legal counsel prior to accepting punishment \nas a result of the Article 15. (TR at page 78 line 7 to page 80 line 16.) As a result of \naccepting Article 15 punishment, Applicant was reduced in rank to an \u201cE-5 and \nrecommended for Administrative Separation\u201d from the Navy. \nI find that Applicant falsified \u201cSection 15 \u2013 Military History \u2013 Discipline \u2013 In the \nlast 7 years\u201d of her May 25, 2019 e-QIP by answering \u201cNo,\u201d in light of her February 9, \n2015 Article 15, noted above. \n2.b. Applicant falsely told her DoD investigator that when she \u201ctold . . . [her] \ncommander about . . . [her] financial difficulties . . . the commander filed for the\u201d non-\njudicial punishment. As noted above under 2.a., the reason for her non-judicial \npunishment also involved allegations of Mutiny and Sedition, and making False Official  \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \nStatements. (TR at page 26 line 3 to page 27 line 6, and at page 65 line 18 to page 66 \nline 3.) I find this to be a willful falsification. \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility, the administrative \njudge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief introductory \nexplanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially disqualifying \nconditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s \nnational security eligibility. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious \nscrutiny of a number of variables known as the whole-person concept. The \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 states the \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d \nA person who applies for access to classified information seeks to enter into a \nfiduciary relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \nSection 7 of Executive Order (EO) 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall \nbe \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the \nloyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple \nprerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information). \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAnalysis \nGuideline F - Financial Considerations \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. Three are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; \n(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant has a history of significant past-due indebtedness. The evidence is \nsufficient to raise these disqualifying conditions. \nAG \u00b6 20 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. I considered \nall of the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 including: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control; and \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts \nAlthough Applicant can attribute much of her delinquencies to her divorce from \nher second husband, her financial problems are ongoing. She has a long history of \ndelinquencies, and still has yet to address past-due indebtedness in excess of $42,000. \nShe has not demonstrated that future financial problems are unlikely. Mitigation under \nAG \u00b6 20 has not been established. Financial Considerations is found against Applicant. \nGuideline E - Personal Conduct \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Personal Conduct is set out in \nAG \u00b6 15: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. The following will normally result \nin an unfavorable national security eligibility determination, security \nclearance action, or cancellation of further processing for national security \neligibility: \n(a) refusal, or failure without reasonable cause, to undergo \nor cooperate with security processing, including but not \nlimited to meeting with a security investigator for subject \ninterview, completing security forms or releases, cooperation \nwith medical or psychological evaluation, or polygraph \nexamination, if authorized and required; and \n(b) refusal to provide full, frank, and truthful answers to \nlawful questions of investigators, security officials, or other \nofficial representatives in connection with a personnel \nsecurity or trustworthiness determination. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 16. Two are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or \nsimilar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine national security \neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities; and \n(b) deliberately providing false or misleading information; or concealing or \nomitting information, concerning relevant facts to an employer, \ninvestigator, security official, competent medical or mental health \nprofessional involved in making a recommendation relevant to a national \nsecurity \neligibility \ndetermination, \nor \nother \nofficial \ngovernment \nrepresentative. \nApplicant not only falsified her e-QIP, but was not entirely truthful during her \nfollow-up interview. The evidence is sufficient to raise these disqualifying conditions. \nAG \u00b6 17 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. I considered \nall of the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 17 including: \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; \n(b) the refusal or failure to cooperate, omission, or concealment was \ncaused or significantly contributed to by advice of legal counsel or of a \nperson with professional responsibilities for advising or instructing the \nindividual specifically concerning security processes. Upon being made \naware of the requirement to cooperate or provide the information, the \nindividual cooperated fully and truthfully; \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, \nunreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely \nto recur; \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate \nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress; and \n(f) the information was unsubstantiated or from a source of questionable \nreliability. \nNone of these apply. Applicant has shown a pattern of concealment and lack of \ncandor. Personal Conduct is found against Applicant. \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuidelines F and E in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were \naddressed under those guidelines, but some warrant additional comment. Applicant is \nwell respected by her peers, and by her supervisor. She performs well at her job. (AppX \nH.) However, overall, the record evidence leaves me with questions or doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant failed to mitigate the Financial Considerations and Personal \nConduct security concerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 1.a: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.b. and 1.c: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.d~1.f.: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.g: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.h~1.j.: \nAgainst Applicant \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nSubparagraphs 1.k. and 1.l: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.m: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.n: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.o: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.p~1.r.: \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 2.a. and 2.b.: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant national security eligibility \nfor a security clearance.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant is a 30-year-old employee of a U.S. defense contractor for whom he has worked since 2012. He is a U.S. citizen by birth, as are all of his nuclear family members. He has a high school diploma and earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in 2014. Both schools from which Applicant graduated are located in the U.S. He has not been married and has no children. He owns no foreign property, nor does he have any 2 foreign financial interests. He has not had any travel outside of the United States in the last seven years. He was awarded a security clearance in January 2019. (Items 3, 4, 5) Applicant uses social media, including dating applications, in order to communicate with foreign nationals. In about January 2019, a stranger located in what Applicant believes was the Philippines (the Scammer) posed as a female online, and coerced Applicant into exposing himself over a video call. The Scammer video recorded the Skype video call. The Scammer then determined Applicant\u2019s identity through Applicant\u2019s social media presence, and threatened to send a snapshot of the compromising video to Applicant\u2019s friends, co-workers, and family unless Applicant paid him money. Applicant panicked, and over the next two days, sent the Scammer two electronic wire transfers totaling $1,000. When the Scammer refused to destroy the compromising data unless Applicant sent him even more money, Applicant refused to send additional funds and blocked the Scammer from communicating with him.

Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nStatement of the Case \nOn June 18, 2021, the Department of Defense (DOD) issued a Statement of \nReasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing security concerns under Guideline D, sexual \nconduct, and Guideline B, foreign influence. Applicant responded to the SOR on July \n14, 2021, and requested a decision based on the written record in lieu of a hearing. On \nDecember 23, 2021, the Government issued an amendment to the SOR detailing \nadditional security concerns under the aforementioned guidelines and under Guideline \nE, personal conduct. Applicant responded to the SOR amendment on February 7, 2022, \nand indicated that he still wished to have a decision based on the written record in lieu \nof a hearing. \nThe Government\u2019s written case was submitted on March 11, 2022.

Applicant received the FORM on \nApril 4, 2022. As of May 24, 2022, he had not responded. The case was assigned to me \non June 16, 2022. The Government exhibits included in the FORM, marked as Items 1-\n5, are admitted in evidence without objection. Department Counsel made a written \nrequest that I take administrative notice of certain facts about the People\u2019s Republic of \nChina (China). Without objection, I have taken administrative notice of the facts \ncontained in the request, which I have marked as Administrative Notice (AN) I.  \nThe facts in AN I are summarized in the written request and will not be repeated \nverbatim in this decision. Of particular note is the significant threat of espionage, cyber-\nespionage, and cyber-attack threats to the United States.  Also noted is the exploitation\nof Chinese citizens or persons with family ties to China to gain insider access to military\nand defense contract secrets; economic espionage; and the significant ongoing human\nrights problems in China.  \n \n \n \nContrary to common practice in these proceedings, Department Counsel failed to \nprovide a written request for me to take administrative notice of the country conditions of \nother countries implicated under Guideline B in the SOR. On my own motion, I have \ntaken administrative notice of country conditions as set forth in official U.S. Government \ndocuments for the Philippines, Japan, Vietnam, and Thailand that I have marked as AN \nII-V, respectively. Those facts are summarized in the official government documents, so \nI will not recite them verbatim here, but I will note general information with respect to \neach, to wit: \nThe Philippines, while an ally of the United States, suffers a significant threat of \nterrorism, civil unrest, and ongoing human rights problems; \nJapan is a successful democracy whose alliance with the U.S. is the cornerstone \nof U.S. security interests in Asia. Japan has provided political and financial support to \nthe U.S. on a broad range of global issues, including combating terrorism; \nVietnam is an authoritarian state ruled by the Communist Party of Vietnam. \nWhile Vietnamese law prohibits arbitrary interference with human rights, the \nVietnamese government has a history of not respecting these prohibitions; and \nThailand is a constitutional monarchy, with a parliamentary democracy. While a \nmilitary junta seized control of the government following a coup in 2014, in 2019 it held \ndemocratic elections. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant is a 30-year-old employee of a U.S. defense contractor for whom he \nhas worked since 2012.

When the Scammer refused to destroy the \ncompromising data unless Applicant sent him even more money, Applicant refused to \nsend additional funds and blocked the Scammer from communicating with him. \nApplicant also made his profile and friends lists on social media private. In February \n2019, Applicant self-reported this extortion to his security officer at his place of \nemployment. Applicant\u2019s employer created an incident report, but took no further action \nagainst Applicant related to this incident. Applicant\u2019s family, his roommate, and his \nemployer are aware of this incident. Applicant claims that he has learned a valuable \nlesson from being extorted online and claims that he takes more precaution with whom \nhe decides to correspond when he uses dating websites. He also claims that he has not \nbeen the subject of additional instances of online scams or extortion. (Items 1, 2, 4, 5) \nIn July 2016, Applicant met a Chinese national, Ms. A, on an online dating site. \nMs. A was temporarily in the United States working at a theme park.

Applicant believes Ms. B was in the United States on a work visa, and was working \nfor a theme park. They went on two dates together and then only communicated online \nafter those two dates. Applicant believes that Ms. B moved back to China in February \n2017. Applicant has not communicated with Ms. B since February 2017. (Items 1-4) \nIn June 2017, Applicant met a Chinese national, Ms. C, on an online dating site. \nMs. C was temporarily in the United States working at a theme park. Applicant and Ms. \nC dated, communicating in-person and online from June 2017 until September 2018, \nwhen Ms. C moved back to China. Once Ms. C moved back to China, they only \ncommunicated online until they ended their relationship later in September 2018 \nbecause of the difficulty of a long distance relationship. Applicant broke up with Ms. C \nover e-mail and received a response from Ms. C that he has not read. Applicant claimed \nhe did not read the letter from Ms. C to avoid getting back together with her, but \nadmitted that he still has this e-mail and may read it in the future. (Items 1-4) \nIn January 2017, Applicant met a Chinese national, Ms. D, on a social media site. \nThey met in person for three consecutive days and then only communicated online \nafterwards.

It is logical that he would have only suspected that she would use his Netflix \naccount information if he provided it to her. (Items 1-4) \nIn April 2017, Applicant met a Vietnamese national, Ms. E, on an online dating \nsite. They met in person once and then only communicated online. Applicant last \ncommunicated with Ms. E in September 2017. (Items 1-4) \nIn March 2017, Applicant met a Thai national, Ms. F, on an online dating site. He \nmet her in person when he went on two dates with her and then communicated with her \nelectronically. Applicant last communicated with Ms. F in April 2017. (Items 1-4) \nApplicant continued to use social media to communicate with foreign nationals \nafter his 2019 incident where he was scammed and extorted. In June 2019, Applicant \nmet a Japanese national, Ms. G, on an online dating site. Ms. G was temporarily in the \nUnited States working at a theme park. Applicant and Ms. G dated, communicating in-\nperson and online. Applicant and Ms. G maintained a romantic relationship until early \n2020 when they stopped dating, but maintained a platonic relationship. The latest \nevidence provided that Applicant and Ms. G communicate electronically \u201cnearly daily.\u201d \n(Items 1, 2, 4) \nIn April 2019, Applicant met a Japanese national, Ms. H on an online dating site. \nHe developed a platonic online friendship with Ms. H and maintains contact via text and \ntelephone on a weekly to monthly basis. Applicant believes that Ms. H is a resident of \nTokyo. (Items 1, 2, 4) \nApplicant does not believe that any of the foreign nationals with whom he has \ncontact are members of a foreign military or government. He claims that he does not \nfeel vulnerable to coercion or duress to divulge secured or protected information as a \nresult of his aforementioned foreign contacts. He claims that he could not be coerced or \nblackmailed into acting against the interests of the United States and that none of these \nforeign contacts are aware that he has access to secured information as he has never \ndiscussed the topic with them. He claims that he has not developed a preference for \nany foreign country or foreign individuals but that he has simply developed a romantic \npreference for women of Asian descent. With the exception of his romantic and platonic \nrelationships with the aforementioned women, there is no record evidence that \nApplicant has any foreign involvement. \nPolicies \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG), which became \neffective on June 8, 2017. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline D, Sexual Behavior \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe security concern for sexual behavior is set out in AG \u00b6 12: \nSexual behavior that involves a criminal offense; reflects a lack of \njudgment or discretion; or may subject the individual to undue influence of \ncoercion, exploitation, or duress. These issues, together or individually, \nmay \nraise \nquestions \nabout \nan \nindividual\u2019s \njudgment, \nreliability, \ntrustworthiness, and ability to protect classified or sensitive information. \nSexual behavior includes conduct occurring in person or via audio, visual, \nelectronic, or written transmission. No adverse inference concerning the \nstandards in this Guideline may be raised solely on the basis of the sexual \norientation of the individual. \nAG \u00b6 13 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. The following disqualifying conditions are potentially applicable: \n(c) sexual behavior that causes an individual to be vulnerable to coercion, \nexploitation, or duress; and  \n(d) sexual behavior of a public nature and/or that reflects lack of discretion \nor judgment.  \nApplicant engaged in activity of a sexual nature over a video conference call that \nwas recorded with a person he did not know, resulting in him being extorted twice for \napproximately $1,000. His actions made him vulnerable to (and resulted in) coercion, \nexploitation, or duress and reflected a lack of judgment. Both of the above disqualifying \nconditions are applicable and the burden shifts to Applicant to provide evidence in \nmitigation. \nConditions that could mitigate sexual behavior security concerns are provided \nunder AG \u00b6 14. The following are potentially applicable: \n(b) the sexual behavior happened so long ago, so infrequently, or under \nsuch unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment;  \n(c) the behavior no longer serves as a basis for coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and \n(d) the sexual behavior is strictly private, consensual, and discreet. \nApplicant has not provided sufficient evidence of any of the above mitigating \nconditions. Applicant claimed he is more careful with whom he communicates online, \nand that he has made his profile and friends lists on social media private. However, it is \nunclear from the record evidence whether Applicant still engages in videoconferences of \na sexual nature with strangers. Without such evidence, Applicant has failed to show that \nhis behavior is unlikely to recur, that it can no longer serve as a basis for coercion, \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nexploitation or duress, or that it is discreet. Accordingly, his conduct continues to cast \ndoubt on his reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. \nGuideline B, Foreign Influence \nThe security concern for foreign influence is set out in AG \u00b6 6: \nForeign contacts and interests, including, but not limited to, business, \nfinancial, and property interests, are a national security concern if they \nresult in divided allegiance. They may also be a national security concern \nif they create circumstances in which the individual may be manipulated or \ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a \nway inconsistent with U.S. interests or otherwise made vulnerable to \npressure or coercion by any foreign interest. Assessment of foreign \ncontacts and interests should consider the country in which the foreign \ncontact or interest is located, including, but not limited to, considerations \nsuch as whether it is known to target U.S. citizens to obtain classified or \nsensitive information or is associated with a risk of terrorism. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 7. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) contact, regardless of method, with a foreign family member, business \nor professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or \nresident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of \nforeign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion;  \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual\u2019s obligation to \nprotect classified or sensitive information or technology and the \nindividual\u2019s desire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing \nthat information or technology; and \n(i) conduct, especially while traveling or residing outside the U.S., that may \nmake the individual vulnerable to exploitation, pressure, or coercion by a \nforeign person, group, government, or country. \nApplicant has had in-person and online contacts with several foreign women, \nincluding multiple women who are citizens of China. China has an authoritarian \ngovernment, dominated by the Communist Party, with a poor human rights record, and \naggressively targets the U.S. for espionage. Applicant\u2019s Chinese connections create a \npotential conflict of interest and a heightened risk of foreign exploitation, inducement, \nmanipulation, pressure, and coercion. Applicant also had online contact with an \nindividual who he believes is a citizen of the Philippines who successfully exploited and \ncoerced Applicant into substantially acting against his pecuniary interests. The above \ndisqualifying conditions have been raised by the evidence and the burden shifts to \nApplicant to provide evidence in mitigation. \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \nConditions that could mitigate foreign influence security concerns are provided \nunder AG \u00b6 8. The following is potentially applicable: \n(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in \nwhich these persons are located, or the positions or activities of those \npersons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be \nplaced in a position of having to choose between the interests of a foreign \nindividual, group, organization, or government and the interests of the \nUnited States;  \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of \nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, or allegiance to the group, \ngovernment, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such deep and \nlongstanding relationships and loyalties in the United States, that the \nindividual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the \nU.S. interest;  \n(c) contact or communication with foreign nationals is so casual and \ninfrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk of foreign \ninfluence or exploitation; and \n(d) the individual has promptly complied with existing agency requirements \nregarding the reporting of contacts, requests, or threats from persons, \ngroups, or organizations from a foreign country. \nThere are several reasons why Applicant\u2019s disqualifying behavior is partially \nmitigated. He has ceased his contact with all listed foreign individuals, but for citizens of \nJapan. Japan has a stable democracy and is an important ally of the United States. \nThese factors make it unlikely Applicant will be placed in a position of having to choose \nbetween the interests of a citizen of Japan and the interests of the United States. \nApplicant has strong and longstanding ties to the United States. He is a U.S. \ncitizen by birth, has lived in the U.S. all his life, and his entire nuclear family are citizens \nand residents of the United States. Applicant was educated in the U.S. and his job is in \nthe U.S. He holds no foreign financial or property interests. Applicant\u2019s relationships \nwith the foreign individuals that he has dated or had contact with have been short-lived \nand casual. Accordingly, there is some evidence that Applicant can be expected to \nresolve any conflict of interest in favor of the U.S. interest. \nHowever, the allegation in SOR \u00b6 2.d is problematic. A foreign individual was \nsuccessful in significantly manipulating or coercing Applicant. He twice acted against his \nown interests by paying the foreign individual a substantial sum of money. While he \nlater reported this incident to the security officer of his employer, he did so after being \ncoerced into doing the foreign individual\u2019s bidding. The foreign individual was not asking \nfor U.S. secrets or secured information this time, but the fact pattern here is far too \nclose to a scenario that Guideline B seeks to avoid. Applicant has not indicated that he \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nhas stopped engaging in the same, risky behavior with foreign nationals. Despite the \npartial applicability of multiple mitigating factors, there is insufficient evidence for \nApplicant to overcome this incident, especially when there is little to no evidence that he \nhas stopped exposing himself to the risk that caused him to be exploited by a foreign \ncontact in the past. \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct  \nThe security concern for personal conduct is set out in AG \u00b6 15: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during the national \nsecurity investigative or adjudicative processes. \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. The following disqualifying conditions are potentially applicable: \n(c) credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is \nnot sufficient for an adverse determination under any other single \nguideline, but which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-\nperson \nassessment \nof \nquestionable \njudgment, \nuntrustworthiness, \nunreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and \nregulations, or other characteristics indicating that the individual may not \nproperly safeguard classified or sensitive information;  \n(d) credible adverse information that is not explicitly covered under any \nother guideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an adverse \ndetermination, but which, when combined with all available information, \nsupports a whole-person assessment of questionable judgment, \nuntrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply \nwith rules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that the \nindividual may not properly safeguard classified or sensitive information.  \nThis includes, but is not limited to, consideration of: \n(1) untrustworthy or unreliable behavior to include breach of client \nconfidentiality, release of proprietary information, unauthorized \nrelease of sensitive corporate or government protected information; \n(2) any disruptive, violent, or other inappropriate behavior; \n(3) a pattern of dishonesty or rule violations; and \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(e) personal conduct, or concealment of information about one\u2019s conduct, \nthat creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress by a \nforeign intelligence entity or other individual or group. Such conduct \nincludes: \n(1) engaging in activities which, if known, could affect the person's \npersonal, professional, or community standing; \n(2) while in another country, engaging in any activity that is illegal in \nthat country; \n(3) while in another country, engaging in any activity that, while \nlegal there, is illegal in the United States. \nAs discussed herein, Applicant\u2019s aforementioned exploitation because of his risky \nsexual behavior and his relationships with foreign women is sufficient for an adverse \ndetermination under other guidelines. Therefore, AG \u00b6\u00b6 16(c) and 16(d) are not raised. \nApplicant\u2019s activity alleged in SOR \u00b6 3.a can (and did) create a vulnerability to \nexploitation, manipulation, or duress by a foreign intelligence entity or other individual or \ngroup. AG \u00b6 16(e) is raised by Applicant\u2019s online sexual video conferencing that \nresulted in him being exploited. \nApplicant\u2019s contact with foreign women in person and online does not, in and of \nitself, create a vulnerability to extortion, manipulation or duress. This behavior is not \nillegal in the United States and there is no evidence that it is illegal in other countries. If \nknown, Applicant\u2019s contacting foreign women over social media would not likely affect \nApplicant\u2019s personal, professional, or community standing. The information contained in \nSOR \u00b6 3.b is not disqualifying under Guideline E. \nAG \u00b6 17 provides conditions that could mitigate personal conduct security \nconcerns. The following mitigating conditions are potentially applicable: \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, \nunreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely \nto recur; and \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate \nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress.  \n10 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \nApplicant has not proven that he no longer has videoconference calls with \nstrangers (foreign or otherwise) where he engages in acts of a sexual or compromising \nnature. Without such evidence he has not shown that this behavior is unlikely to recur or \nthat he has reduced or eliminated his vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or \nduress. On the record evidence, none of the mitigating factors under AG \u00b6 17 apply. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n(1) The nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guidelines D, B, and E in my whole-person analysis. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude that it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to continue Applicant\u2019s security clearance. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline D:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 1.a: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline B: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 2.a-2.c: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 2.d: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 2.e: \nFor Applicant \n11 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nParagraph 3, Guideline E \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 3.a:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nSubparagraph 3.b:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIt is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for \na security clearance.

(Transcript (Tr.) at 10, 22-23; GE 1, 2) \nApplicant started smoking marijuana in 1992 when he was a freshman in college. \nHe continued to sporadically use marijuana through November 2018. He used \nhallucinogenic mushrooms on one occasion in 2017, but he did not like the experience \nand never used them again. (Tr. at 10, 14-15; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 1, 2) \nApplicant lives in a state that has not legalized marijuana. In 2016, he invested in \na registered marijuana farm in a state that has made marijuana legal under state law. \nHe owned about 12% of the farm. He had no involvement in the operation of the farm. \nHe sold his share of the farm for $75,000 in December 2020. (Tr. at 16-17; Applicant\u2019s \nresponse to SOR; GE 1, 2; AE A) \nApplicant reported his use of marijuana and hallucinogenic mushrooms and his \ninvestment in the marijuana farm on the Questionnaire for National Security Positions \n(SF-86) he submitted in July 2019. He reported that he used marijuana about once a \nyear, with his last use in November 2018. He checked the box indicating that he \nintended to use marijuana in the future, with the explanation: \u201cTHC combined with CBD \nhave proven therapeutic effects on the human body, and THC is legal in two-thirds \n(33/50) of US states plus our nation\u2019s capital. I do not smoke or consume THC in public \nplaces and do not operate a motor vehicle while under the influence.\u201d (GE 1) \nApplicant discussed his drug use during his background interview in July 2019. \nHe stated that he did not intend to use illegal drugs in the future. He repeated that \nposition in his response to interrogatories in November 2020, in his March 2021 \nresponse to the SOR, and at his hearing. (GE 2) \nApplicant has not used any illegal drugs since November 2018, before he started \nwork for a defense contractor and before he submitted his SF-86. He understands that \nmarijuana possession is against federal law, and illegal drug use and investments in the \nmarijuana industry are inconsistent with holding a security clearance. He credibly \ntestified that he does not intend to use marijuana or any other illegal drug in the future. \nHe provided a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, acknowledging that any future involvement or misuse is grounds for \nrevocation of national security eligibility (Tr. at 10-11, 15-20; Applicant\u2019s response to \nSOR; GE 1, 2; AE B) \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \nPolicies \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG), which became \neffective on June 8, 2017. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAnalysis \nGuideline H, Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nThe security concern for drug involvement and substance misuse is set out in AG \n\u00b6 24: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior \nmay lead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. Controlled substance means any \u201ccontrolled substance\u201d \nas defined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term \nadopted in this guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above. \nThe Security Executive Agent (SecEA) promulgated clarifying guidance \nconcerning marijuana-related issues in security clearance adjudications on December \n21, 2021 (Security Executive Agent Clarifying Guidance Concerning Marijuana for \nAgencies Conducting Adjudications of Persons Proposed for Eligibility for Access to \nClassified Information or Eligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position, dated December 21, \n2021 (SecEA Clarifying Guidance)). It states in pertinent part: \n[Federal] agencies are instructed that prior recreational marijuana use by \nan individual may be relevant to adjudications but not determinative. The \nSecEA has provided direction in [the adjudicative guidelines] to agencies \nthat requires them to use a \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d This requires \nadjudicators to carefully weigh a number of variables in an individual\u2019s life \nto determine whether that individual\u2019s behavior raises a security concern, \nif at all, and whether that concern has been mitigated such that the \nindividual may now receive a favorable adjudicative determination. \nRelevant mitigations include, but are not limited to, frequency of use and \nwhether the individual can demonstrate that future use is unlikely to recur, \nincluding by signing an attestation or other such appropriate mitigation. \nAdditionally, in light of the long-standing federal law and policy prohibiting \nillegal drug use while occupying a sensitive position or holding a security \nclearance, agencies are encouraged to advise prospective national \nsecurity workforce employees that they should refrain from any future \nmarijuana use upon initiation of the national security vetting process, \nwhich commences once the individual signs the certification contained in \nthe Standard Form 86 (SF-86), Questionnaire for National Security \nPositions.  \n4 \n        \n \n        \n \n        \n*\n*\n* \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFinally, with regard to the topic of investments, agencies should note that \nan adjudicative determination for an individual\u2019s eligibility for access to \nclassified information or eligibility to hold a sensitive position may be \nimpacted negatively should that individual knowingly and directly invest in \nstocks or business ventures that specifically pertain to marijuana growers \nand retailers while the cultivation and distribution of marijuana remains \nillegal under the Controlled Substances Act. Under [the adjudicative \nguidelines\u2019] guidance for personal conduct (Reference B, Guideline E), a \ndecision to invest in an activity, including a marijuana-related business, \nwhich the individual knows violates federal law could reflect questionable \njudgment and an unwillingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations. \nThat is, it is appropriate for adjudicative personnel to consider whether an \nindividual is knowingly facilitating violations of the Controlled Substances \nAct by engaging in such investments. On the other hand, if the marijuana-\nrelated investment is not direct, such as an investment in a diversified \nmutual fund that is publicly-traded on a United States exchange, \nadjudicators should presume that individual did not knowingly invest in a \nmarijuana-related business; thus, the indirect investment should not be \nconsidered relevant to adjudications. \nIn some instances, the investment itself may be illegal, which is also \nrelevant to [the adjudicative guidelines\u2019] guidance for criminal conduct \n(Reference B, Guideline J), which by its very nature calls into question an \nindividual\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, and \nregulations. However, under the whole-person concept, any mitigating \nfactors should be considered. For example, if an individual holds direct \nstock investments pertaining to marijuana growers and retailers, \ndivestment of such activity or disassociation of such activity should be \nconsidered a mitigating factor when rendering an adjudicative decision. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 25. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) any substance misuse (see above definition);  \n(c) illegal possession of a controlled substance, including cultivation, \nprocessing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of \ndrug paraphernalia; and \n(g) expressed intent to continue drug involvement and substance misuse, \nor failure to clearly and convincingly commit to discontinue such misuse. \nApplicant possessed and used marijuana and hallucinogenic mushrooms. He \nwas part owner of a registered marijuana farm in a state that has made marijuana legal \nunder state law. AG \u00b6\u00b6 25(a) and 25(c) are applicable. He indicated in his SF-86 that he \nintended to continue to use marijuana. He no longer holds that position. AG \u00b6 25(g) was \napplicable at one time. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 26 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. The following \nare potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \nand \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this \nproblem, and has established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not \nlimited to: \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used;\nand \n \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that any future \ninvolvement or misuse is grounds for revocation of national security \neligibility. \nApplicant has not used marijuana since November 2018, more than three years \nago. He used hallucinogenic mushrooms on one occasion in 2017, but he did not like \nthe experience and never used them again. He sold his share of the marijuana farm. He \ncredibly testified that he does not intend to use marijuana or any other illegal drug in the \nfuture. \nApplicant understands that marijuana possession is against federal law, and \nillegal drug use and investments in the marijuana industry are inconsistent with holding \na security clearance. He fully disclosed his drug involvement on his SF-86 and \nthroughout the security clearance proceedings, which bolsters his credibility. His \nconduct no longer casts doubt on his reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. I \nfind that Applicant has abstained from illegal drug use for an appropriate period, and \nthat illegal drug use is unlikely to recur. AG \u00b6\u00b6 26(a) and 26(b) are applicable. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the\nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guideline H in my whole-person analysis. I also considered the SecEA \nClarifying Guidance. I conclude that this decision is consistent with that guidance. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude Applicant \nmitigated the drug involvement and substance misuse security concerns.  \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline H:  \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.d: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIt is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance.

In addition to brief introductory \nexplanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially disqualifying \nconditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s \nnational security eligibility. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious \nscrutiny of a number of variables known as the whole-person concept. The \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 states the \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d \nA person who applies for access to classified information seeks to enter into a \nfiduciary relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \nSection 7 of Executive Order (EO) 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall \nbe \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the\nloyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple\nprerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \n \nAnalysis \nGuideline F - Financial Considerations \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. Three are potentially applicable in this case:   \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; \n(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant had significant past-due indebtedness The evidence is sufficient to \nraise these disqualifying conditions. \nAG \u00b6 20 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. I considered \nall of the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 including: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control; \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \nApplicant\u2019s financial problems are ongoing. He has a history of delinquencies, \nand still owes past-due debts totaling about $20,900. Applicant has not demonstrated \nthat future financial problems are unlikely. Mitigation under AG \u00b6 20 has not been \nestablished. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline F in my whole-person analysis. Overall, the record evidence leaves me with \nquestions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I \nconclude Applicant failed to mitigate the Financial Considerations security concerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a. and 1.b: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.c~1.e: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.f: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.g. and 1.h: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.i. and 1.j: \nFor Applicant \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant national security eligibility \nfor a security clearance.

He reported that he followed a budget, but he had not \nhad credit counseling. He claimed that he was making an effort to communicate with his \ncreditors to resolve his financial delinquencies. (Item 7). \nThe SOR alleges ten delinquent debts totaling $80,631. Seven of these debts are \nstudent loans totaling $79,171. The status of the debts are as follows: \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.g are student loans in collection, totaling $79,171. The October 2020 \ncredit report shows that two loans originated in 2006, three in 2010, and two in 2012. The \ncredit report also shows that these loans first became delinquent in 2104, and the date of \nlast payment for these loans was in March 2020. In his 2019 SCA and background \ninterview, he reported that his student loans were in default. He stated that they were \ndelinquent because of unexpected medical expenses, but he did not provide any further \ninformation. He claimed that he previously arranged to rehabilitate the loans by making \n$411 monthly payments. He claimed that he made nine payments, but failed to follow \nthrough to make the accounts current. In his interrogatory response, he provided a letter \nfrom December 2020 showing correspondence with a collection agency to rehabilitate his \nstudent loans. An unsigned agreement attached to the letter required that he make nine \npayments of $882 to rehabilitate the loans. However, Applicant failed to provide any \ndocumentation showing that he ratified the agreement or made any payments to the \ncollection agency. (Item 3, 4, 5, 7,) \nSOR \u00b6 1.h is a past-due auto loan for $1,207.

Applicant stated that he fell behind on his loan payment for one month, and was \nunable to catch up. This debt is unresolved. (Item 5, 7) \nSOR \u00b6 1.i is a medical debt in collection for $66.

He provided no \nevidence that he has received credit counseling. \nPolicies \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG), which became \neffective on June 8, 2017. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in conjunction \nwith the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation of potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds.  \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nThe SOR allegations evidencing Applicant\u2019s history of financial delinquencies are \nestablished by Applicant\u2019s admissions, and the credit reports in the record. AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) \nand 19(c) apply. \nConditions that could mitigate the financial considerations security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 20. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; and \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nApplicant paid SOR \u00b6 1.j in November 2020. I find that allegation in Applicant\u2019s \nfavor. AG \u00b6 20(a) does not apply to the remaining SOR debts. Applicant failed to provide \nsufficient evidence showing that any of the remaining SOR debts are resolved, or that \nthey became delinquent under circumstances that are unlikely to recur. In his background \ninterview, Applicant attributed unexpected medical expenses as the reason for his \ndelinquencies, however, he failed to provide any further information to asses that claim. \nHe also failed to provide sufficient documentation of his current financial situation, \nevidence which might establish his ability to address his debts responsibly. His failure to \npay his delinquent debt is recent, ongoing, and not isolated. His failure to meet his \nfinancial obligations continues to cast doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, and \ngood judgment. \nAG \u00b6 20(b) could potentially apply. In his background interview, Applicant claimed \nthat the reason for his delinquencies were due to unexpected medical expenses. \nHowever, he failed to provide any further information to asses that claim, or evidence that \nshows that he acted responsibly under the circumstances. AG \u00b6 20(b) does not apply \nAG \u00b6 20(d) could potentially apply to his student loan debts. However, Applicant \ndid not provide sufficient documentation of payment arrangements or of any payments \nmade. AG \u00b6 20(d) does not apply. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the potentially \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and circumstances \nsurrounding this case.

Applicant did not provide \nsufficient evidence to mitigate the security concerns arising out of Applicant\u2019s delinquent \ndebts under Guideline F. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a - 1.h: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.j: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIt is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for \na security clearance.

After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings, testimony, and \nexhibits submitted, I make the following additional findings of fact. \nApplicant is 47 years old. He was awarded a bachelor\u2019s degree. He is married \nand he has two children, ages 14 and 17. He volunteers in his community and has \ncoached youth soccer. He is a consultant to several Government agencies, including \nthe DOD. He has worked for his current employer since 2016 (his current employer \nacquired the company who hired him in 2016). He was granted a security clearance in \n2016, after completing his security clearance application (SCA) in July 2016. (Tr. 6, 21, \n29-30; GE 1) \nThe SOR alleged Applicant used marijuana, with varying frequency, from 2014 to \nabout 2019, and he used marijuana, with varying frequency, from about 2016 to about \n2019, while holding a security clearance. (See SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a - 1.b.) \nApplicant credibly testified that his marijuana use was very limited. While he \nadmitted using recreationally in college, his 2014 to 2019 uses were all due to his \ndecision to use marijuana rather than prescribed opioids to manage his pain after four \noral surgery procedures during that timeframe. His first two oral surgeries were in 2010 \nor 2011 and 2014 timeframe, and he took the prescribed opioid pain medicine. He \nbecame concerned about the addictive effect of these drugs and talked to his doctors \nabout alternative pain management, including using marijuana. His third oral surgery \nwas in 2016, after he filled out his SCA in July 2016. He admitted using marijuana rather \nthan opioids for pain management after this surgery. He lives in a state where marijuana \nuse is legal under state law. He did not list his marijuana use on the SCA because, he \nbelieved his use was legal under state law and the question asked about \u201cillegal\u201d drug \nusage. Even though he did not have to do so, Applicant applied for and received a \nmedical marijuana card. He only used marijuana after the dental surgeries for pain \nmanagement.

Later in 2018, Applicant believed he self-reported to his \nemployer his marijuana pain-management use after his 2016 surgery. (Tr. 39, 42-43; \nGE 2, AE A) \nIn 2019, Applicant had a fourth oral surgery. He once again used marijuana \nrather the opioids for pain management after the surgery. This was the last time \nApplicant used marijuana. While he has not informed his employer about this marijuana \nuse, during his January 2020 background investigation, he disclosed this information to \nthe investigator. Applicant admitted that he was confused as to what his obligations \nwere regarding the prohibition on marijuana use given the legality differences between \nfederal and state jurisdictions. He admitted that he did not seek clarification from his \nfacilities security officer or other company officials. (Tr. 25, 27, 41-42, 44-45) \nApplicant provided a signed statement indicating his intent not to use illegal \ndrugs, including marijuana in the future. He expects to have at least one more oral \nsurgery in the future, but he will not use marijuana for pain management after that \nprocedure. He will talk with his doctors about other pain management options and if he \nhas to, he will take the prescribed opioids. (Tr. 46, 49; AE B) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process.

Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline H, Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nAG \u00b6 24 expresses the security concern pertaining to drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual's reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior \nmay lead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. Controlled substance means any \"controlled substance\" \nas defined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term \nadopted in this guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above. \nAG \u00b6 25 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. Two conditions are potentially applicable in this case, to wit: \n(a) any substance misuse; and \n(f) any illegal drug use while granted access to classified information or \nholding a sensitive position. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant used marijuana on several occasions between 2014 and 2019, some \nuses, after 2016 were when he possessed a security clearance. I find AG \u00b6\u00b6 25(a) and \n(f) apply.  \nAG \u00b6 26 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. Two \npotentially apply in this case: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \nand \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this \nproblem, and has established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not \nlimited to: \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; \nand \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that any future \ninvolvement or misuse is grounds for revocation of national security \neligibility. \nApplicant used marijuana on a limited basis. His uses while holding a security \nclearance occurred after he had two oral surgeries (in 2017 and 2019) and he used \nmarijuana for pain management rather than using prescribed opioids. He has not used \nmarijuana since his 2019 oral surgery. He does not intend to use it in the future, even if \nthat means taking prescription opioids after his next surgery. He signed a written \nstatement in 2021 pledging not to use marijuana in the future. I found Applicant\u2019s \ntestimony credible. He has not been involved with any drug activity since 2019. AG \u00b6 \n26(a) applies. His three years of abstinence and his written commitment are sufficient to \ndemonstrate Applicant\u2019s intent not to use in the future. AG \u00b6 26(b) applies. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and circumstances of the conduct; (2)the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guideline and the whole-person concept. \nOn December 21, 2021, the Director of National Intelligence signed the \nmemorandum, Security Executive Agent Clarifying Guidance Concerning Marijuana for \nAgencies Conducting Adjudications of Persons Proposed for Eligibility for Access to \nClassified Information or Eligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position. It emphasizes that \nfederal law remains unchanged with respect to the illegal use, possession, production \nand distribution of marijuana. Individuals who hold a clearance or occupy a sensitive \nposition are prohibited by law from using controlled substances. Disregard of federal law \npertaining to marijuana (including prior recreational marijuana use) remains relevant, \nbut not determinative, to adjudications of eligibility. Agencies are required to use the \n\u201cwhole-person concept\u201d to determine whether the applicant\u2019s behavior raises a security \nconcern that has not been mitigated. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I considered Applicant\u2019s limited \nmarijuana use for pain management, his written commitment not to use marijuana in the \nfuture, and his three years of marijuana abstinence. Applicant provided sufficient \nevidence to mitigate the security concerns. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant mitigated the security concerns arising under Guideline H, drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline H:  \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.b: \nFor Applicant \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

He is also self-employed as an independent contractor as an executive protection \n(bodyguard) service provider since 2014. He was previously employed in an armed \nsecurity position from January to July 2019; agent-in-charge of special events/field \ntraining officer/site lead from February 2018 to August 2018; executive protection officer \nfrom June 2017 to July 2019 for two other companies; VIP security host lead from \nDecember 2011 to October 2014; and security supervisor from October 2009 to \nDecember 2011.

Under Guideline G, \nthe SOR alleges Applicant was arrested in another state, in about December 2004, \ncharged and convicted of DUI; and he was arrested in about August 2017 and charged \nwith DUI and open container of alcohol in a vehicle. Under Guideline J, the SOR cross-\nalleges the previous SOR allegations, and that he was arrested in about March 2015 and \ncharged with trespassing, a charge in which he pleaded guilty; and in September 2016, \nhe committed domestic battery against his former spouse. This allegation was amended \nto allege that his former spouse accused him of domestic battery on at least three \noccasions in July, August, and September 2016.

Applicant admitted \nto all of the original SOR allegations except SOR \u00b6 3.c (alleging domestic battery against \nhis former spouse), and generally objected to the amended SOR allegations. \nApplicant admitted to using marijuana recreationally and regularly, usually on \nweekends and when socializing, from 1993 to 2019. He both purchased it and it was \nprovided by friends. He purchased marijuana approximately twice per month from about \n1998 to about 2016, and approximately once per month from about 2016 to 2019. Of note, \nhe denied purchasing marijuana when interviewed by a Government investigator in \nDecember 2019. He also declared the accuracy of his personal subject interview (PSI) \nsummary in a January 2021, interrogatory response. (GE 2) \nApplicant testified that he used cocaine recreationally about \u201conce every six \nmonths,\u201d from about 2008 to January 2019, usually at social gatherings. However, he \nalso inconsistently stated in testimony that he only used cocaine three to four times. \nHowever, in his PSI, he stated he used cocaine with his former spouse \u201cweekly to \nquarterly\u201d during social settings at nightclubs. (GE 2) During this period of illegal drug use, \nhe worked in several security and executive protection positions, purchased firearms in \n2009, 2010, and 2020, and held a concealed firearm permit (CFP) for executive protection \nand personal safety, issued by his current state of residence in 2013 and renewed it in \n2018. It remains valid until 2023. The CFP application (Rev 8/19) states: \nYou are not eligible to carry a Concealed Firearm Permit if any of the \nfollowing apply: . . . (6) You have habitually used intoxicating liquor or a \ncontrolled substance to the extent that your normal faculties are impaired, \nincluding DUI convictions within five previous years and Medical Marijuana \nPatients. (AE B) \nIn his answer to the SOR, Applicant claimed his use of marijuana \u201coccurred on my \npersonal time.\u201d However, he admitted that in 2006, he was working security and \nbodyguard jobs in nightclubs and \u201con the entertainment scene\u201d and \u201cwas exposed to the \ngood and the bad that went along with it.\u201d He stated that he initially rejected cocaine that \nwas offered to him, but eventually gave in and used it \u201cto understand the effects and \ncorrelate it with the behaviors [he] experienced as a security/bodyguard.\u201d At times it was \n\u201coffered to [him] from someone [he] or a client of [his] was interacting with.\u201d \nApplicant testified that he stopped using marijuana and cocaine on or about \nJanuary 1, 2019, partly as a result of a new year\u2019s resolution. Coincidentally, he began \nworking in an armed security position in January 2019 that required obtaining a state \nprivate investigator license from a state licensing board to carry a firearm, and he worked \narmed security for several medical marijuana dispensaries as well as jewelry and trade \nshows. He also applied for a security clearance in August 2019. In a post-hearing \nsubmission, Applicant provided a signed notice of intent to abstain from all drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse.

He was convicted in 2005, placed on probation, and required to \ncomplete alcohol-related classes. In his answer to the SOR, he stated that he was driving \nhome from a work-related holiday party. He said he \u201cgained valuable insight from that \nexperience.\u201d \nIn 2017, Applicant was again arrested for DUI and open container of alcohol after \nhe drove into a tree after returning from a bachelor party at 5 a.m. He was the \u201cdesignated \ndriver\u201d for his friends during the evening. He testified that he had a \u201cshot or two\u201d during \nthe evening, but denied that alcohol contributed to the accident. Of note, in his answer to \nthe SOR, he admitted to having \u201ca drink a couple drinks [sic] with dinner\u201d at a casino. \nWhen the police found an open container and a closed beer in his armrest, he stated they \nwere placed there without his knowledge. He said he \u201cdozed off a mile, or less, from home \nassumedly because [he] was in familiar surroundings and [his] body was comfortable.\u201d \nHe was given a field sobriety test at the scene but he refused a breathalyzer test because \nhe \u201cfelt their demeanor and attitude switch towards [him] and [he] no longer trusted the \nprocess.\u201d (Ans.) He was arrested for DUI and open container. The police suspected drunk \ndriving and obtained a warrant to take blood samples, but it was hours after the accident. \nApplicant stated that his subsequent blood tests showed his blood alcohol level was under \nthe legal limit. He was not ultimately charged with drunk driving, but was found guilty of \nfailure to maintain a lane and having an open container of alcohol in his vehicle. \nIn 2015, Applicant was charged with trespassing. He testified that he was at a \ncasino when he had a vocal disagreement with a card dealer and management over \nerrors he perceived were committed by the table dealer. Of note, he did not mention his \ndisagreement with the dealer during his PSI, rather he stated he was drinking while \nplaying a table game \u201cwithout incident\u201d when the table game manager asked him to stop \nplaying and leave. He believed he was being treated unfairly and disrespected, and he \nrefused to leave the casino even though the manager and security officials told him they \nwould call the police. He believed it was a \u201cpeaceful protest\u201d for the way in which he was \ntreated. Applicant was arrested, offered a deal to plead no contest, and was convicted of \ntrespass. In his answer to the SOR, he claimed the incident was a result of racism and \nother factors, was asked \u201cone last time to leave or be arrested,\u201d and that he was \n\u201ccomfortable protesting and standing up for what [he] believed was right.\u201d He noted that \nsince then, he has \u201cmeditated and looked back on the situation and understands that \nthere are some things that are out of [his] control and it is better to remove [himself] from \nthose situations than to add fuel to the fire.\u201d \nApplicant married his former spouse in May 2016, but they lived together before \nmarrying. He moved out in October 2016, and their divorce was final in December 2016. \nIn a September 2016 police report to her local police department, Applicant\u2019s former \nspouse accused him of choking her and shaking her in July 2016 while they were at his \nmother\u2019s home in another state.

She reported the \nSeptember incident about four days after it occurred, apparently after returning to their \nstate of residence. No arrest was made because the incidents occurred in another \njurisdiction. \nIn the same police report, Applicant\u2019s former spouse also alleged an incident in \nAugust 2016, where they were drinking at a bar when he began arguing with her and \nmade a scene. She left the bar and Applicant followed. He blocked her from entering their \nvehicle and continued arguing. He became angry and pulled her hair and yelled without \nletting it go. At some point, he drew his firearm, pointed it at himself, and yelled \u201cwhat do \nyou want me to do, blow my brains out\u201d? She did not report the incident at the time it \noccurred because she thought he would change. Applicant admitted drinking that night \nand taking out his firearm and threatening to kill himself, but denied pulling her hair.

They \ngenerally attested to his reliability and good character, but his wife\u2019s cousin, a military \nmember that has known him for three years, was unaware of any issues with alcohol or \ndrugs. Neither were aware of the SOR allegations. Applicant also submitted character \nletters from co-worker and a training director/apprentice coordinator. Both attest to his \nwork ethic, positive attitude, reliability, accountability, and willingness to take on greater \nresponsibilities and to teach new apprentices, but neither mentioned specific SOR \nallegations. Additionally, Applicant\u2019s current spouse wrote a strong, supportive letter on \nhis behalf, attesting to his judgment, kindness, reliability, and compassion. Applicant also \nnoted that after his divorce in 2016, he enrolled in personal counseling with a licensed \ntherapist to address his emotional and mental concerns. No records of diagnosis or \ntreatment were submitted from these counseling sessions. \nPolicies \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v.

As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527.

This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \n\u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \u201cSubstantial \nevidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. Washington \nMetro.

The guidelines presume a \nnexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria listed \ntherein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 12-01295 at 3 \n(App. Bd.

Controlled substance means any \u201ccontrolled substance\u201d as \ndefined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term adopted in \nthis guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 25. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) any substance misuse (see above definition); and \n(c) illegal possession of a controlled substance, including cultivation, \nprocessing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of \ndrug paraphernalia. \nApplicant purchased and used marijuana between 1993 and 2019, and used \ncocaine between 2008 and 2019. AG \u00b6\u00b6 25(a) and (c) apply. \nAG \u00b6 26 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. I have \nconsidered all of the mitigating conditions, and find the following conditions as \npotentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and substance \nmisuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and \nhas established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not limited to: \n  (1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; \n  (2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; and \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that any future \ninvolvement or misuse is grounds for revocation of national security \neligibility. \nApplicant has a long history of illegal drug use. He claims to have stopped in \nJanuary, 2019, coincident with his new armed security position that required obtaining a \nstate private investigator license from a state licensing board to carry a firearm, and the \nsame year he applied for his first security clearance. However, Applicant did not refrain \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nfrom using illegal drugs while working armed personal security details as a CFP holder. \nDespite his submission of a statement of intent to refrain from further drug use, and claim \nto have disassociated himself from drug using associates, he has not shown sufficient \nevidence of disassociation, a changed environment, or action to overcome his drug usage \nhistory. Of note, he continues to work executive protection contracts, which appears to \nbe the same type of environment in which he used drugs before, and none of his \nwitnesses were able to discuss his past drug use or changes he has made to his lifestyle. \nInsufficient time has passed since he stopped using illegal drugs, and I do not find \nthat the circumstances in which he used drugs in the past are unlikely to recur. Of further \nconcern is Applicant\u2019s drug involvement while working in a security position and while \ncarrying a firearm. Although the requirements in Applicant\u2019s state may be ambiguous as \nto the degree of illegal drug use allowed by individuals applying for a CFP, obtaining \neligibility for a security clearance is not. Also, he falsely denied purchasing marijuana \nwhen interviewed by a Government investigator and falsely declared the accuracy of his \nPSI summary in an interrogatory response. While not alleged in the SOR, this conduct \nmay be considered to decide whether a particular adjudicative guideline is applicable, to \nevaluate evidence of extenuation, mitigation, or changed circumstances, or as part of a \nwhole-person analysis. \nApplicant\u2019s history of drug use continues to cast doubt on his current reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and good judgment. Partial mitigation credit is applied for his promise to \nrefrain from further drug use, however, Applicant has not shown convincing evidence that \nhis drug use is completely behind him. Perhaps with his new marriage and time away \nfrom the environments where drugs where present in the past, along with a lifestyle \nchange, will enable him to make a convincing case in the future. The matters discussed \nunder this Guideline show questionable judgment that has not been overcome by \nmitigating evidence. \nGuideline G, Alcohol Consumption \nAG \u00b6 21 expresses the security concern for alcohol consumption: \nExcessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable \njudgment or the failure to control impulses, and can raise questions about \nan individual's reliability and trustworthiness. \nAG \u00b6 22 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while under \nthe influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or other \nincidents of concern, regardless of the frequency of the individual\u2019s alcohol \nuse or whether the individual has been diagnosed with alcohol use disorder. \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s has two alcohol related driving incidents, including a DUI conviction \nand a suspected alcohol-related accident with a conviction for having an open container \nin the vehicle. These meet the conditions set forth in AG \u00b6\u00b6 22(a). His involvement in an \nargument with his former spouse after drinking, drawing a firearm, and threatening to kill \nhimself; a trespassing arrest after drinking; and his alleged spousal abuse are not alleged \nin the SOR under this guideline. However, conduct not alleged in the SOR may be \nconsidered to decide whether a particular adjudicative guideline is applicable, to evaluate \nevidence of extenuation, mitigation, or changed circumstances, or as part of a whole-\nperson analysis. ISCR Case No. 03-20327 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, 2006). I have \nconsidered Applicant\u2019s conduct where alcohol was involved to any degree, for these \nlimited purposes. \nI have also considered all of the mitigating conditions for alcohol consumption \nunder AG \u00b6 23, including: \n(a) so much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or \njudgment;  \n(c) the individual is participating in counseling or a treatment program, has \nno previous history of treatment and relapse, and is making satisfactory \nprogress in a treatment program; and \n(d) the individual has successfully completed a treatment program along \nwith any required aftercare, and has demonstrated a clear and established \npattern of modified consumption or abstinence in accordance with treatment \nrecommendations. \nApplicant has two alcohol-related arrests, the last in 2017. Although significant time \nmay have passed since these incidents, the fact that Applicant attended alcohol-related \nclasses while on probation from his 2004 DUI, and again drove after drinking alcohol, \ndespite being the designated driver for the evening, raises cause for concern. I am not \npersuaded that his alcohol consumption has changed to the extent that a recurrence of \nalcohol-related incidents is unlikely. There is insufficient evidence demonstrating a clear \nand established pattern of modified consumption; or that he has shown an interest in \nobtaining a medical evaluation or attending an effective alcohol treatment program given \nhis history of alcohol-related driving and personal interactions. Despite Applicant\u2019s \ntestimony, significant doubts remain about his judgment based on his alcohol-related \ndriving offenses, allegations of spousal abuse, arrest for trespassing, and carrying and \ndrawing a firearm with threats of suicide after drinking. His evidence is insufficient to \nmitigate the alcohol consumption security concern. \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for criminal conduct is set out in AG \n\u00b6 30: \nCriminal activity creates doubt about a person\u2019s judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person\u2019s ability or \nwillingness to comply with laws, rules and regulations. \nAG \u00b6 31 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying in this case. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) a pattern of minor offenses, anyone of which on its own would be unlikely\nto affect a national security eligibility decision, but which in combination cast\ndoubt on the individual\u2019s judgment, reliability, or trustworthiness; and \n \n \n(b) evidence (including, but not limited to, a credible allegation, an \nadmission, and matters of official record) of criminal conduct, regardless of \nwhether the individual was formally charged, prosecuted or convicted.  \nApplicant\u2019s admissions, testimony, and the documentary evidence in the record \nconcerning his purchase and use of illegal drugs, driving arrests, trespassing arrest, and \nallegations of abusive conduct with his former spouse, are sufficient to establish the \ndisqualifying conditions above. \nConditions that could mitigate criminal conduct security concerns are provided \nunder AG \u00b6 32. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur and \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; and \n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including, but not limited \nto, the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, restitution, \ncompliance with the terms of parole or probation, job training or higher \neducation, \ngood \nemployment \nrecord, \nor \nconstructive \ncommunity \ninvolvement. \nApplicant has not provided sufficient evidence in mitigation. Given the totality of \nhis involvement with law enforcement over a number of years, I continue to have concerns \nthat this pattern of misconduct may continue given the right circumstances. Despite \nserving probation and alcohol-related driving classes after his first DUI, Applicant had \nanother driving incident where alcohol was involved. Although he has a favorable \nemployment record, there has been insufficient time elapsed to show that he has left \ncriminal activity behind, and changed his lifestyle. Given the totality of his conduct, \nespecially with the combination of drug involvement, alcohol, and firearms, I remain \n10 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ndoubtful about Applicant\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment at this time. No \nmitigation fully applies. \nGuideline E: Personal Conduct \nThe concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 15: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. \nThe relevant disqualifying conditions under AG \u00b616 are: \n(c) credible adverse information in several adjudicative issues areas that is \nnot sufficient for an adverse determination under any other single guideline, \nbut which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-person \nassessment of questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack \nof candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations, or other \ncharacteristics indicating that the individual may not properly safeguard \nclassified or sensitive information; \n(d) credible adverse information that is not explicitly covered under any \nother guideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an adverse \ndetermination, but which, when combined with all available information, \nsupports a whole-person assessment of questionable judgment, \nuntrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with \nrules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that the individual \nmay not properly safeguard classified or sensitive information. This \nincludes, but is not limited to, consideration of: \n(1) untrustworthy or unreliable behavior to include breach of client \nconfidentiality, release of proprietary information, unauthorized \nrelease of sensitive corporate or government protected information; \n(2) any disruptive, violent, or other inappropriate behavior; \n(3) a pattern of dishonesty or rule violations; and \n(4) evidence of significant misuse of Government or other employer's \ntime or resources; \n(e) personal conduct, or concealment of information about one's conduct,\nthat creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress by a\nforeign intelligence entity or other individual or group. Such conduct\nincludes: \n \n \n \n11 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(1) engaging in activities which, if known, could affect the \nperson's personal, professional, or community standing; \n(2) while in another country, engaging in any activity that is \nillegal in that country; \n(3) while in another country, engaging in any activity that, \nwhile legal there, is illegal in the United States; and \n(g) association with persons involved in criminal activity. \nApplicant\u2019s misconduct as established by his admissions, testimony, and record \nthe evidence support a finding of questionable judgment; disruptive, violent, or other \ninappropriate behavior; personal conduct that creates a vulnerability to exploitation, \nmanipulation, or duress; and association with persons involved in criminal activity. AG \u00b6\u00b6 \n16(c), (d), (e), and (g) apply. In addition, although not specified in the SOR, Applicant \nfalsified statements related to purchasing marijuana to a Government investigator, and \ncertified those statements as correct in response to Government interrogatories. This may \nbe considered for the limited purpose to decide whether a particular adjudicative guideline \nis applicable, to evaluate evidence of extenuation, mitigation, or changed circumstances, \nor as part of the whole-person analysis. \nConditions that could mitigate personal conduct security concerns are provided \nunder AG \u00b6 17. The following are potentially applicable: \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that caused untrustworthy, unreliable, \nor other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to recur; \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate vulnerability \nto exploitation, manipulation, or duress; and \n(g) association with persons involved in criminal activities was unwitting, \nhas ceased, or occurs under circumstances that do not cast doubt upon the \nindividual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, judgment, or willingness to comply \nwith rules and regulations. \nApplicant\u2019s conduct taken as a whole, displays an attitude of superiority and being \nabove the law; all of which is incompatible with trustworthiness, good judgment, and \nwillingness to follow rules and regulations expected of security clearance applicants.

He \nhas not submitted sufficient evidence to alleviate those concerns. The allegations are not \nminor, nor did they occur in unique circumstances where they are not likely to recur. He \nhas not accepted full responsibility for his conduct, and appears to downplay the gravity \nof his conduct or the extent of his involvement. I am not clear why the array of incidents \nhave occurred in Applicant\u2019s life, but alcohol, drugs, or anger management seem to be \ncentrally implicated. He is a mature, intelligent adult who has worked and continues to \nwork in a position of trust and reliability, especially while providing armed personal \nsecurity. I continue to question his past judgment and I am not convinced it is appropriate \nat this time to mitigate his history of poor decision making and misconduct. I find no \nmitigating condition is fully applicable. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder AG \u00b6\u00b6 2(a), 2(c), and 2(d), the ultimate determination of whether to grant \nnational security eligibility must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. Under the whole-person \nconcept, the administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security \nclearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process \nfactors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d). \nI considered all of the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my findings of fact \nand comments under Guidelines H, G, J, and E in my whole-person analysis. I considered \nApplicant\u2019s \ndivorce \nand \nremarriage, \ncurrent \nwork \nand \npersonal \ncharacter \nrecommendations, his desire to cease drug use, and his changed personal \ncircumstances. However, I am not yet convinced that Applicant is willing or able to \npermanently put his past misconduct aside and show good judgment in all areas of his \nlife, especially those that are relevant to security eligibility. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. Accordingly, I conclude he \nhas not carried his burden of showing that it is clearly consistent with the national security \ninterests of the United States to grant him eligibility for access to classified information. \n13 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \namended, as required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline H: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline G:  \nAGAINST A\n PPLICANT \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 3, Guideline J: \nAGAINST A\n PPLICANT \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 4, Guideline E:  \nAGAINST A\n PPLICANT \nAgainst Applicant \n Subparagraphs 1.a and 1.b: \n \n \n \n \n \n  Subparagraphs 2.a and 2.b: \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  Subparagraphs 3.a-3.c:  \n \n \n \n \n \n   Subparagraph 1.a  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n_______________________ \nConclusion \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national security interest of the \nUnited States to grant Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nApplicant\u2019s security clearance is denied. \nGregg A.

(HE 3) He provided some information about the current status of \nhis debts: he disputed the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.e; he did not admit or deny the debt in SOR \u00b6 \n1.i; and he paid the debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.h, 1.k, 1.l, and 1.m. (Id.) He also provided mitigating \ninformation. (Id.) His admissions are accepted as findings of fact. \nApplicant is a 61-year-old account manager. (Tr. 17-18; GE 1) In 1979, he received \nan associate\u2019s degree in electronics. (Tr. 17, 33; GE 1 at 13) He attended college for three \nyears. (Tr. 33) He married in 2002, and his two children are ages 12 and 17. (Tr. 17) \nFinancial Considerations \nApplicant and his spouse were partners in the ownership and management of a \nlimited liability corporation (LLC) from 2002 to 2018. (Tr. 19) His LLC sold items totaling \nabout $15,000,000 through Internet-based sales. (Tr. 19-20; SOR response) He has a \npatent and trade marks for various products. (SOR response; AE F) He and his spouse \nobtained multiple credit cards from 2003 to 2005, which he used to fund business \noperations. (Tr. 32) His LLC had financial problems beginning around 2012 to 2013 \nbecause of increased Internet advertising costs to such an extent that his LLC was losing \nmoney. (Tr. 19-20) He unsuccessfully tried several strategies to reduce costs. (Tr. 20-21) \nIn 2018, Applicant and his spouse closed the LLC. (Tr. 21) Applicant contended the debts \nwere the responsibility of the LLC and not his personal responsibility. (Tr. 56) He did not \nprovide the contracts used to obtain the credit or other documentation showing the LLC \nwas responsible for the debts, or that he was not responsible for the debts. (Tr. 58-59) \nApplicant\u2019s SOR alleges 16 delinquent debts totaling $161,160 as follows: \u00b6 1.a \nfor $30,429; \u00b6 1.b for $26,452; \u00b6 1.c for $26,075; \u00b6 1.d for $18,096; \u00b6 1.e for $16,395; \n2 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n  \n   \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n     \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\u00b6 1.f for $12,030; \u00b6 1.g for $6,642; \u00b6 1.h for $4,803; \u00b6 1.i for $3,356; \u00b6 1.j for $3,338; \u00b6 1.k \nfor $3,183; \u00b6 1.l for $3,026; 1.m for $2,900; 1.n for $2,019; 1.o for $1,699; and 1.p for \n$717. (HE 2) According to the SOR, the following debts are charged off: \u00b6 1.a through \u00b6 \n1.e; \u00b6 1.h; \u00b6 1.i; \u00b6 1.l; \u00b6 1.m; \u00b6 1.o; and \u00b6 1.p. The following SOR debts are in collections: \n\u00b6 1.f; \u00b6 1.g; \u00b6 1.j; \u00b6 1.k; and \u00b6 1.n. \nApplicant used multiple credit cards and bank accounts to pay business expenses. \n(Tr. 23; SOR response) He discussed settlements with some creditors; however, they \nsaid he had to be in default a minimum of 120 days before they would negotiate a \nsettlement with him. (Tr. 22, 56) When the LLC was closed, it had about $874,000 in debt, \nand he was able to settle 60 to 70 percent of the debt. (Tr. 22, 29) He used a home equity \nloan for $180,000 to pay some of the LLC-related debts. (SOR response) Other creditors \nwould not discuss a settlement, particularly after the debt was charged off. (Tr. 23) \nApplicant did not retain any documentation about his proposals to settle debts, except for \nthe documentation presented at his hearing and in his SOR response. (Tr. 50-52) Some \nSOR debts, including the debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d, 1.f, 1.g, 1.j, and 1.p, were dropped from \nhis credit report because he was in default more than seven years. (Tr. 24-28) Some \ndebts remain on his credit report in charged-off status, for example, the same creditor is \nlisted in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a ($30,429), 1.b ($26,452), 1.c ($26,075), 1.e ($16,395), and 1.i \n($3,356), and his January 7, 2022 Experian credit report shows three charged-off debts \nfor that creditor in the amounts of $26,075, $26,452, and $30,429 with each debt having \n\u201c66 potentially negative months.\u201d (AE D) Evidently, seven years without payments will \nelapse in mid-2023 (84 negative months), and those three debts will be dropped from his \ncredit report. The SOR \u00b6 1.i account was removed from his credit report, and he did not \nremember whether he paid it. (Tr. 26) \nApplicant said the creditor for the debts in \u00b6\u00b6 1.h ($4,803), 1.k ($3,183), and 1.l \n($3,026) sued his company, and he settled and paid off the debt without litigating the \nmerits of his liability in court. (Tr. 25-26) On April 16, 2018, a state court issued a dismissal \nupon stipulated terms for a lawsuit listing the creditor in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.h, 1.k, and 1.j as the \nplaintiff, and \u201c[Applicant by name], et. al.,\u201d as the defendant(s) (not the LLC). (SOR \nresponse at 4) The settlement terms were that the defendant was required to pay $1,000 \non April 26, 2018, and $404 monthly until $10,690 is paid. (Id.) The LLC\u2019s name appeared \non the bottom of the page, near the name of the defendant, which was Applicant\u2019s name. \n(Id.) Applicant\u2019s counsel signed as attorney for the plaintiff as opposed to attorney for the \nLLC. (Id.) Applicant suggested that maybe they put his name on the heading for the \nlawsuit because he was the party in contact with the creditor about the debt. (Tr. 57-58) \nOn May 12, 2020, the creditor wrote that the settlement amount for the debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 \n1.h, 1.k, and 1.l was paid, and the debt was resolved. (Tr. 47; AE B) The creditor\u2019s \ncorrespondence was addressed to Applicant by name and not to his LLC. (AE B) \nOn June 21, 2017, Applicant agreed to settle the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.m ($2,900) with \na current balance of $4,200 under the following terms: pay $2,500 on July 21, 2017, with \nthe remaining $1,700 balance to be paid in 36 monthly installments of $47. (AE A) \nApplicant paid the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.m. (Tr. 27, 47) Applicant said the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.n \nfor $2,019 was the same debt as the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.m.

Applicant contended the LLC was liable for the unpaid SOR debts, and he\nwas not personally liable for them. (Tr. 28) Applicant did not receive any IRS Form 1099-\nC, cancellation of indebtedness, documents from the creditors. (Tr. 49)    \n \n \nApplicant worked on negotiations with the creditors for about two years after he \ndefaulted, and then he learned about his state\u2019s three-year statute of limitations from a \ncredit counseling service. He waited for the three-year state statute of limitations to expire \nin some instances for debts. (Tr. 52, 54) He explained his rationale for handling of his \ndebts as follows: \n[S]o I was really holding out for those three years for some of these charge \noffs. So once I reached the three years, I thought I was in a good position \nto renegotiate now because they - - you know, I have nothing to lose, and \nthey have everything to gain. So, I did contact them three years afterwards \nbecause I was in a strong position, and they were still not interested in \nmaking a settlement. (Tr. 52-53)   \nApplicant\u2019s federal and state income taxes are current. (Tr. 30) He is not delinquent \non any federal debts. (Tr. 30) His mortgage on his residence is almost paid.

(AE G-J) The general sense of his character \nevidence is that Applicant is honest, thoughtful, diligent, responsible, loyal, generous, \nkind, and exceptionally intelligent. Applicant is not an alcoholic or a gambler, and he does \nnot live beyond his means. (Tr. 61) He is patriotic, and he never does anything that is \ncriminal or illegal. (Tr. 61) \nPolicies \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the Executive \nBranch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security emphasizing, \n\u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v.

The President \nhas authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicant\u2019s eligibility for \naccess to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \nIndustry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nabout potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Clearance \ndecisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a \ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 7. \nThus, nothing in this decision should be construed to suggest that it is based, in whole or \nin part, on any express or implied determination about applicant\u2019s allegiance, loyalty, or \npatriotism. It is merely an indication the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the \nPresident, Secretary of Defense, and Director of National Intelligence have established \nfor issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 at 2 \n(App. Bd. May 2, 1996). \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it \nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his [or her] security \nclearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). The burden of \ndisproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-\n31154 at 5 (App. Bd.

Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nThe Appeal Board explained the scope and rationale for the financial \nconsiderations security concern in ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012) \n(citation omitted) as follows: \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an applicant might \nknowingly compromise classified information in order to raise money in \nsatisfaction of his or her debts. Rather, it requires a Judge to examine the \ntotality of an applicant\u2019s financial history and circumstances. The Judge \nmust consider pertinent evidence regarding the applicant\u2019s self-control, \njudgment, and other qualities essential to protecting the national secrets as \nwell as the vulnerabilities inherent in the circumstances. The Directive \npresumes a nexus between proven conduct under any of the Guidelines \nand an applicant\u2019s security eligibility. \nAG \u00b6 19 includes disqualifying conditions that could raise a security concern and \nmay be disqualifying in this case: \u201c(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the\nability to do so\u201d; and \u201c(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations.\u201d    \n \nIn ISCR Case No. 08-12184 at 7 (App. Bd. Jan. 7, 2010), the Appeal Board \nexplained: \nIt is well-settled that adverse information from a credit report can normally \nmeet the substantial evidence standard and the government\u2019s obligations \nunder [Directive] \u00b6 E3.1.14 for pertinent allegations. At that point, the burden \nshifts to applicant to establish either that [he or] she is not responsible for \nthe debt or that matters in mitigation apply. \n(internal citation omitted). The record establishes the disqualifying conditions in AG \u00b6\u00b6 \n19(a) and 19(c), requiring additional inquiry about the possible applicability of mitigating \n6 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \nconditions. Discussion of the disqualifying conditions is contained in the mitigation \nsection, infra. \nThe financial considerations mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are as follows: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control;  \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and  \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue. \nIn ISCR Case No. 10-04641 at 4 (App. Bd. Sept. 24, 2013), the DOHA Appeal \nBoard explained Applicant\u2019s responsibility for proving the applicability of mitigating \nconditions as follows:  \nOnce a concern arises regarding an Applicant\u2019s security clearance \neligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance of \na security clearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th \nCir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991). After the Government \npresents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the \napplicant to rebut or mitigate those concerns. See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. The \nstandard applicable in security clearance decisions is that articulated in \nEgan, supra. \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access \nto classified information will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nDirective, Enclosure 2 \u00b6 2(b).  \nApplicant described one circumstance beyond his control, which adversely \naffected his finances. He and his spouse owned an LLC, and expenses increased so \nsignificantly they were unable to continue the business. However, \u201c[e]ven if Applicant\u2019s \nfinancial difficulties initially arose, in whole or in part, due to circumstances outside his \n7 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ncontrol, the Judge could still consider whether Applicant has since acted in a reasonable \nmanner when dealing with those financial difficulties.\u201d ISCR Case No. 05-11366 at 4 n.9 \n(App. Bd. Jan. 12, 2007) (citing ISCR Case No. 03-13096 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 29, 2005); \nISCR Case No. 99-0462 at 4 (App. Bd. May 25, 2000); ISCR Case No. 99-0012 at 4 (App. \nBd. Dec. 1, 1999)). \nAnother component under AG \u00b6 20(a) is whether Applicant maintained contact with \ncreditors and attempted to negotiate partial payments to keep debts current. He \nintentionally stopped making payments to cause the debts to go into default to improve \nhis negotiating position. Applicant did not provide supporting documentary evidence that \nhe maintained contact with the SOR creditors except for the two creditors which filed \nlawsuits relating to the five debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.h, 1.k, 1.l, 1.m, and 1.n. He did not provide \nletters or documents proposing settlements or payments to the other SOR creditors. \nApplicant is credited with paying the debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.h ($4,803), 1.k ($3,183), \n1.l ($3,026), and \u00b6 1.m ($2,900). The debt in SOR \u00b6 1.n ($2,019) is the same debt as the \ndebt in SOR \u00b6 1.m. These five debts are mitigated. \nApplicant indicated several of his SOR debts were dropped from his credit report. \n\u201c[T]hat some debts have dropped off his [or her] credit report is not meaningful evidence \nof debt resolution.\u201d ISCR Case No. 14-05803 at 3 (App. Bd. July 7, 2016) (citing ISCR \nCase No. 14-03612 at 3 (App. Bd. Aug. 25, 2015)). The Fair Credit Reporting Act requires \nremoval of most negative financial items from a credit report seven years from the first \ndate of delinquency or the debt becoming collection barred because of a state statute of \nlimitations, whichever is longer. See Title 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1681c. See Federal Trade \nCommission website, Summary of Fair Credit Reporting Act Updates at Section 605, \nhttps://www.consumer.ftc.gov/articles/pdf-0111-fair-credit-reporting-act.pdf. Debts may \nbe dropped from a credit report upon dispute when creditors believe the debt is not going \nto be paid, a creditor fails to timely respond to a credit reporting company\u2019s request for \ninformation, or when the debt has been charged off. \nApplicant received reasonable and accurate financial advice that the state statute \nof limitations for credit card debt is three years. For a revolving line of credit, like a credit \ncard, the clock starts running for statute of limitations purposes when the Applicant failed \nto make his minimum payment. From that point forward the credit card company must file \na lawsuit against him in court within 3-years to enforce the debt or it is considered \ncollection barred. State statutes of limitations for various types of debts range from 2 to \n15 years. See Nolo Law for All website, Chart: Statutes of Limitations in All 50 States, \nhttp://www.nolo.com/legal-encyclopedia/statute-of-limitations-state-laws-chart-\n29941.html. According to the Federal Trade Commission, Consumer Information \nwebpage, it is illegal under the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act for a creditor to threaten \nto sue to collect a time-barred debt. http://www.consumer.ftc.gov/articles/0117-time-\nbarred-debts. The South Carolina Court of Appeals succinctly explained the societal and \njudicial value of application of the statute of limitations: \nStatutes of limitations embody important public policy considerations in that \nthey stimulate activity, punish negligence and promote repose by giving \n8 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nsecurity and stability to human affairs. The cornerstone policy consideration \nunderlying statutes of limitations is the laudable goal of law to promote and \nachieve finality in litigation. Significantly, statutes of limitations provide \npotential defendants with certainty that after a set period of time, they will \nnot be [haled] into court to defend time-barred claims. Moreover, limitations \nperiods discourage plaintiffs from sitting on their rights. Statutes of \nlimitations are, indeed, fundamental to our judicial system. \nCarolina Marine Handling, Inc. v. Lasch, 363 S.C. 169, 175-76, 609 S.E.2d 548, 552 (S.C. \nCt. App. 2005) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted). South Carolina case law \nis not binding on state courts in other states. However, the South Carolina Court of \nAppeals\u2019 description of the basis for this long-standing legal doctrine is instructive. See \nalso Tulsa Professional Collection Services, Inc. v. Pope, 485 U.S. 478, 486 (1988) \n(where the U.S. Supreme Court noted that \u201cThe State\u2019s interest in a self-executing statute \nof limitations is in providing repose for potential defendants and in avoiding stale claims.\u201d). \nOnce Applicant stopped making payments, the creditor had to file suit within the \nstatute of limitations to maintain the collectability of their debt. There is no evidence that \nthe creditors in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.g, 1.i, 1.j, 1.o, and 1.p took judicial action in court \nto pursue collection of these 11 debts totaling $145,229. Assuming these 11 SOR debts \nare collection barred, they are still relevant to financial considerations security concerns: \nApplicant\u2019s argument concerning the unenforceability of the largest debt \ndue to the running of the statute of limitations fails to demonstrate the Judge \nerred. First, security clearance decisions are not controlled or limited by \nstatutes of limitations. Second, absent an explicit act of Congress to the \ncontrary, the Federal Government is not bound by state law in carrying out \nits functions and responsibilities. Applicant does not cite to any Federal \nstatute that requires the Federal Government to be bound by state law in \nmaking security clearance decisions. Third, a security clearance \nadjudication is not a proceeding aimed at collecting an applicant\u2019s personal \ndebts. Rather, it is a proceeding aimed at evaluating an applicant\u2019s \njudgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. Accordingly, even if a delinquent \ndebt is legally unenforceable under state law, has been discharged in a \nbankruptcy, or is paid, the Federal Government is entitled to consider the \nfacts and circumstances surrounding an applicant\u2019s conduct in incurring and \nfailing to satisfy the debt in a timely manner. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 01-\n09691 at 3 (App. Bd. Mar. 27, 2003).

There is no evidence that these 11 \ndebts are being resolved. I have assumed that Applicant could not be held financially \nresponsible for these 11 debts because of the state statute of limitations. However, he \ndid not provide sufficient documentation about why he was unable to make greater \ndocumented progress resolving these 11 debts. He did not show with documentary \nevidence that the creditors would refuse payment notwithstanding the statute of \nlimitations. There is insufficient assurance that this financial problem is being resolved. \nUnder all the circumstances, he failed to establish mitigation of financial considerations \nsecurity concerns. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation\nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct;\n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the\nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), \u201c[t]he ultimate determination\u201d of whether to grant a security \nclearance \u201cmust be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines\u201d and the whole-person concept. My comments under Guideline F are \nincorporated in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were \naddressed under that guideline but some warrant additional comment. \nApplicant is 61-year-old account manager. In 1979, he received an associate\u2019s \ndegree in electronics, and he attended college for three years. He built a successful \nbusiness with income of $15,000,000. His character evidence, award from a previous \nemployer, performance evaluations, and management of a successful business support \ngranting him access to classified information, and are important indicators of his excellent \npotential for important contributions to the national defense.

Applicant is not an alcoholic or a gambler, \nand he does not live beyond his means. He is patriotic, and he never does anything that \nis criminal or illegal. \nApplicant provided important financial mitigating information. His finances were \nharmed by a circumstance beyond his control. All of his debts are current, except for the \n11 debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.g, 1.i, 1.j, 1.o, and 1.p. He is financially successful with \nabout $2,500,000 in net worth. He and his spouse have ample income to pay their debts \nand maintain their financial responsibilities. Aside from his unresolved SOR debts, he is \nan excellent candidate for a security clearance. \nThe evidence against grant of a security clearance is more substantial at this time. \nApplicant did not provide documentation about why he was unable to make greater \ndocumented progress resolving the 11 debts totaling $145,229 in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through \n1.g, 1.i, 1.j, 1.o, and 1.p. He did not provide persuasive documentary evidence showing \nhe made specific and reasonable offers to settle the 11 debts. His lack of documented \nresponsible financial action in regard to these 11 debts for the last five years raises \nunmitigated questions about his reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified \ninformation. See AG \u00b6 18. \nIt is well settled that once a concern arises regarding an applicant\u2019s security \nclearance eligibility, there is a strong presumption against granting a security clearance. \nSee Dorfmont, 913 F. 2d at 1401. \u201c[A] favorable clearance decision means that the record \ndiscloses no basis for doubt about an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified \ninformation.\u201d ISCR Case No. 18-02085 at 7 (App. Bd.

In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines (AG) list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. The entire \nprocess is a conscientious scrutiny of applicable guidelines in the context of a number of \nvariables known as the whole-person concept. The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires, \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. I have not drawn inferences based on mere speculation or \nconjecture. \n \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.14, requires the Government to present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, \u201cThe applicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d  \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants national \nsecurity eligibility. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the \napplicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as \nto potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified or sensitive information. \nFinally, as emphasized in Section 7 of Executive Order 10865, \u201cAny determination under \nthis order adverse to an applicant shall be a determination in terms of the national interest \nand shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d \nSee also Executive Order 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information.) \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAnalysis \nParagraph 1 (Guideline F, Financial Considerations) \nThe security concerns relating to the guideline for financial considerations are set \nout in AG \u00b6 18, which reads in pertinent part: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAG \u00b6 19 describes three conditions that could raise security concerns and may be \ndisqualifying in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired. \nApplicant had five past-due or charged-off debts and one tax lien at the time the \nSOR was issued. These facts establish prima facie support for the foregoing disqualifying \nconditions, and shift the burden to Applicant to mitigate those concerns. \n \nThe guideline includes four conditions in AG \u00b6 20 that could mitigate the security \nconcerns arising from Applicant\u2019s alleged financial difficulties: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority \nto file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \nApplicant\u2019s financial situation occurred because he had difficulties finding a job in \nhis field after leaving the Coast Guard due to an injury. Once he was employed and built \nup sufficient savings he paid all of his debts, including his tax debt. Some he paid in full, \nothers he paid for a lesser, agreed amount. All of the debts in the SOR were resolved in \n2021. All of the mitigating conditions apply. Paragraph 1 is found for Applicant. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s potential for national security eligibility by considering the totality of the \napplicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should \nconsider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant national security \neligibility for a security clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon \ncareful consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \npertinent facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant has mitigated the \nconcerns regarding his past-due indebtedness that he has resolved. Overall, the record \nevidence does not create substantial doubt as to Applicant\u2019s present suitability for national \nsecurity eligibility and a security clearance. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a through 1.f: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s national security \neligibility for a security clearance.

Administrative Judge \nBased upon a review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, \nApplicant mitigated financial consideration concerns. Eligibility for access to classified \ninformation or to hold a sensitive position is granted. \nStatement of the Case \nOn December 7, 2020 the Department of Defense (DoD) Consolidated Central \nAdjudications Facility (CAF) issued a statement of reasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing \nreasons why under the financial considerations guideline the DoD could not make the \npreliminary affirmative determination of eligibility for granting a security clearance, and \nrecommended referral to an administrative judge to determine whether a security \nclearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked. The action was taken \nunder Executive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \nIndustry (February 20, 1960); DoD Directive 5220.6 Defense Industrial Personnel \nSecurity Clearance Review Program, (January 2, 1992) (Directive); and Security \nExecutive Agent Directive 4, establishing in Appendix A the National Security \nAdjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information or \nEligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position (AGs), effective June 8, 2017. \nApplicant responded to the SOR on February 16, 2021, and requested a hearing. \nThis case was assigned to me on October 26, 2021.

At the hearing, the \nGovernment\u2019s case consisted of four exhibits. (GEs 1-4) Applicant relied on nine \nexhibits (AEs A-F) and one witness (himself). The transcript (Tr.) was received by \nDOHA on January 28, 2022. \nProcedural Issues \nBefore the close of the hearing, Applicant requested the record be kept open to \npermit him the opportunity to supplement the record with updated payment, budgeting, \nand credit repair information. For good cause shown, Applicant was granted 14 \ncalendar days to supplement the record. Department Counsel was afforded seven days \nto respond. \nWithin the time permitted, Applicant supplemented the record with documented \ninformation about his progress in addressing his delinquent debts. Applicant\u2019s post-\nhearing submissions were admitted, without objection, for consideration as AEs H-N \nSummary of Pleadings \nUnder Guideline F, Applicant allegedly accumulated 11 delinquent consumer and \nmedical debts exceeding $46,000. Allegedly, these debts remain unresolved and \noutstanding. \nIn his response to the SOR, Applicant admitted several of the allegations with \nexplanations and clarifications. For these admitted allegations, he claimed he had loan \ninsurance to cover the debts incurred preceding his military separation. He claimed he \nhas been working to resolve these debts since 2016, albeit to no avail. He further \nclaimed he has enlisted the help of a law firm to resolve the listed SOR debts alleged to \nbe delinquent and is still in the process of resolving these debts that have increased in \namount since their origination in 2015. \nFor those debts he denied, Applicant claimed these debts are being challenged \nby the law firm he retained to investigate the validity of the SOR-listed debts. He also \nclaimed to have briefed his security manager and her predecessor on the financial \nissues he is working on. He claimed, too, to have created a budget to track his spending \nareas that he can cut back on, engaged credit monitoring firms, and has taken steps to \nreview his credit reports more often to keep better track of his timely paying of his bills. \nApplicant also pledged to enlist the help of reputable credit counseling firms to provide \nfurther credit counseling. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant is a 40-year-old civilian employee of a defense contractor who seeks a \nsecurity clearance.

(GE 1; Tr. \n59) He attended college classes between August 2017 and January 2020, but did not \nearn a diploma. (GE 1) More recently, he completed six on-line credits for his enrolled \nbusiness courses. (AE H; Tr. 56) Applicant enlisted in the Air Force in September 2001 \nand served 15 years of active duty. He received an honorable discharge in January \n2016. (GE 1; Tr. 56) \nSince January 2016, Applicant has been employed by his current employer (who \nhas undergone several name changes since then) as a scheduler. (GE 1 and AE J; Tr. \n62-64) Previously, he worked for other employers in various jobs while he was still on \nactive military duty. (GEs 1-2) He held a security clearance while he was in the Air \nForce and is currently sponsored by his employer for a security clearance. (GE 1; Tr. \n63) \nApplicant\u2019s finances  \nFollowing his active-duty discharge from the Air Force in January 2016, Applicant \nstruggled to keep up with his financial responsibilities due to the reduced income he \nwas earning from his post-military job and his loss of housing, insurance, and food \nexpense coverage. (GE 2) Credit records document that he accumulated in excess of \n$46,000 in consumer debts, in addition to accruing two medical debts exceeding $500 \nbefore his military separation in January 2016. (GEs 2-4) At the time of his military \ndischarge, Applicant estimates he was making around $50,000 a year, in addition to his \nreceipt of valuable housing and other living expenses. \nCiting a pre-military discharge insurance policy to cover many of his pre\u00ad\ndischarge debts while he sought post-discharge employment, Applicant could not obtain \na copy of his insurance policy from the identified carrier, who is no longer in business. \n(AEs B-C; Tr. 43-45). Nor was he able to provide information on the specific lines of \nloans and debts the insurance was designed to cover. (Tr. 58) \nFollowing the hearing, Applicant was able to locate a copy of a letter covering his \n2016 application for debtor\u2019s insurance to meet his payment obligations to SOR creditor \n\u00b6 1.b. (AE M) Without a copy of the policy itself, however, terms and conditions of the \npolicy cannot be identified and validated. Because this insurance carrier never \nreportedly covered any of Applicant\u2019s pre-discharge debts before going out of business \n(AE M), inferences can be drawn of policy payment restrictions and limitations on \npayouts to any of Applicant\u2019s pre-discharge creditors. Before his military discharge, \nApplicant obtained other insurance policies as well to cover other debts that might \nemerge following his anticipated military separation. See GE 2; Tr. 58) \nTo help him repair his credit and establish a budget for addressing his existing \nand future debts, Applicant retained a credit-repair firm in January 2022.

These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe AGs list guidelines to be considered by judges in the decision-making \nprocess covering DOHA cases. These guidelines take into account factors that could \ncreate a potential conflict of interest for the individual applicant, as well as \nconsiderations that could affect the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified information. These guidelines include conditions that could raise a \nsecurity concern and may be disqualifying (disqualifying conditions), if any, and all of \nthe conditions that could mitigate security concerns, if any. \nThese guidelines must be considered before deciding whether or not a security \nclearance should be granted, continued, or denied. Although, the guidelines do not \nrequire judges to place exclusive reliance on the enumerated disqualifying and \nmitigating conditions in the guidelines in arriving at a decision. \nIn addition to the relevant AGs, judges must take into account the pertinent \nconsiderations for assessing extenuation and mitigation set forth in \u00b6 2(a) of the AGs, \nwhich are intended to assist the judges in reaching a fair and impartial, commonsense \ndecision based on a careful consideration of the pertinent guidelines within the context \nof the whole person. The adjudicative process is designed to examine a sufficient period \nof an applicant\u2019s life to enable predictive judgments to be made about whether the \napplicant is an acceptable security risk. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s conduct, the relevant guidelines are to be \nconsidered together with the following \u00b6 2(d) factors: (1) the nature, extent, and \nseriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include \nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which \nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other \npermanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation of the conduct; (8) the potential for \npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or \nrecurrence. \n5 \n\n \n \n                                                                                                                                              \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n     \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nViewing the issues raised and evidence as a whole, the following individual \nguidelines are pertinent herein: \nFinancial Considerations \nThe Concern:  Failure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts\nand meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of\njudgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules or regulations, all of which\ncan raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and\nability to protect classified or sensitive information.

AG \u00b6 18.   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nBurdens of Proof \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nabout potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nClearance decisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be \na determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 7. \nSee also Exec. Or. 12968 (Aug. 2, 1995), \u00a7 3.1. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in \nthe personal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant \nfrom being eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden \nof establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d   See v. \nWashington Metro.

While most of his \nSOR-listed debts covered by the SOR have been charged off or otherwise removed \nfrom his credit reports, they raise trust, reliability, and judgment concerns about her \ncurrent and future ability to manage her finances safely and responsibly. \nFinancial concerns \nApplicant\u2019s accumulation of delinquent debts (comprised of consumer and \nmedical debts) warrant the application of two of the disqualifying conditions (DC) of the \nfinancial consideration guidelines: DC \u00b6\u00b6 19(a), \u201cinability to satisfy debts\u201d; and 19(c), \u201ca \nhistory of not meeting financial obligations.\u201d Each of these DCs apply to Applicant\u2019s \nsituation. \nThe several debts Applicant admitted with explanations require no independent \nproof to substantiate them. See Directive 5220.6 at E3.1.1.14; McCormick on Evidence\n\u00a7 262 (6th  ed. 2006). His admitted debts are fully documented and create judgment\nissues as well over the management of her finances. See ISCR Case No. 03-01059\n(App. Bd. Sept. 24, 2004). Although he qualified his admissions with explanations, his\nadmissions can be weighed along with other evidence developed during the hearing.  \n \n \n \n \nFinancial stability in a person cleared to protect classified information is required \nprecisely to inspire trust and confidence in the holder of a security clearance that \nentitles the person to access classified information. While the principal concern of a \nsecurity clearance holder\u2019s demonstrated difficulties is vulnerability to coercion and \ninfluence, judgment and trust concerns are implicit in cases involving delinquent debts. \nHistorically, the timing of addressing and resolving debt delinquencies are critical to an \nassessment of an applicant\u2019s trustworthiness, reliability, and good judgment in following \nrules and guidelines necessary for those seeking access to classified information or to \nholding a sensitive position. See ISCR Case No. 14-06808 at 3 (App. Bd. Nov. 23. \n2016); ISCR Case No. 14-01894 at 5 (App. Bd.

None of these raised \ndisputes are supported by adequate contemporaneous documentation covering the \nfactual and legal bases of his disputes with these creditors. \nTo apply MC \u00b6 20(e), \u201cthe individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the \nlegitimacy of the past-due debts which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of \nactions to resolve the issue,\u201d it was incumbent upon Applicant to supply documented \nevidence of the nature of the dispute, the substantive basis of his claims and efforts on \nher part to resolve the dispute with the creditor before declining any further payments. \nWithout such evidence, MC \u00b6 20(e) has only limited application to the facts of \nApplicant\u2019s case. Still, Applicant has shown considerable reliance on the credit repair \nfirm he retained in January 2022, and with their assistance in identifying and validating \ndebts listed in the SOR, he has been able to make a good deal of progress in \naddressing his individual debts and resolve them favorably. For these efforts, he is \nentitled to considerable overall credit in addressing and resolving his delinquent \naccounts. \nIn evaluating Guideline F cases, the Appeal Board has stressed the importance \nof a \u201cmeaningful track record\u201d that includes evidence of actual debt reduction through \nthe voluntary payment of accrued debts. ISCR case No. 07-06482 at 2-3 (App. Bd. May \n21, 2008) In Applicant\u2019s case, he has demonstrated considerable personal responsibility \nin addressing his debts and overcoming his misplaced reliance on the debtor\u2019s \ninsurance policy he arranged prior to his military separation in 2016.  \nApplicant\u2019s concerted payment initiatives this past year enable him to take \nadvantage of the mitigating benefits of MC \u00b6 20(d), \u201cthe individual initiated and is \nadhering to a good-faith to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.\u201d His \nefforts to date enable him to satisfy the Appeal Board\u2019s imposed evidentiary burdens on \napplicants to provide documentation corroborating actions taken to resolve financial \nproblems. See ISCR Case No. 19-02593 at 4-5 (App. Bd. Oct. 18, 2021); ISCR Case \nNo. 19-01599 at 3 (App. Bd. Jan. 20, 2020) Although, potentially applicable statutes of \nlimitation and debts removed from credit reports for reasons other than payment or \nresolution by other voluntary means (to include meritorious disputes of debts) may not \nbe equated with good-faith voluntary efforts to repay overdue creditors. Applicant\u2019s \noverall efforts in addressing his delinquent debts enable him to overcome the statutory \nbars applicable to any of the debts that have fallen off his credit reports for reasons \nother than payment and reliance on meritorious disputes.

After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings, testimony, and exhibits submitted, I make the following findings of fact. Applicant is 56 years old. He immigrated to the United States in 1987. He had no family here at the time. He attended college on and off until he graduated in 1998 with a bachelor\u2019s degree. He suspended his college studies due to his finances. Due to learning English while in college, it was more difficult for him. He married in 1993. He became a citizen in 1997 and has a daughter from the marriage who recently completed her college degree. (GE 1; Tr. 39-48) Applicant funded his college studies through student loans. In 1998, he began working at a car rental agency earning approximately $28,000 annually. His wife did not work from 1993 to 1999. She began attending community college in 1999. In 2000, Applicant began getting behind in repaying his student loans. His elderly parents had immigrated to the United States in 2000 and were living with him. They lived with him until 2016. They are now in a senior facility, and he provides monthly support for them. In 2001, Applicant filed bankruptcy and had his debts discharged, except for his student loans.

The Government offered exhibits (GE) 1 through 6. \nApplicant\u2019s attorney objected to GE 5. Her objection was overruled. There were no \nobjections to the other exhibits, and they were admitted into evidence. Applicant and two \nwitnesses testified on his behalf. He offered Applicant Exhibits A through DD, which were \nadmitted without objection. DOHA received the hearing transcript on November 23, 2021. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant admitted all of the allegations in the SOR. After a thorough and careful \nreview of the pleadings, testimony, and exhibits submitted, I make the following findings \nof fact. \nApplicant is 56 years old. He immigrated to the United States in 1987. He had no \nfamily here at the time. He attended college on and off until he graduated in 1998 with a \nbachelor\u2019s degree. He suspended his college studies due to his finances. Due to learning \nEnglish while in college, it was more difficult for him. He married in 1993. He became a \ncitizen in 1997 and has a daughter from the marriage who recently completed her college \ndegree. (GE 1; Tr. 39-48) \nApplicant funded his college studies through student loans. In 1998, he began \nworking at a car rental agency earning approximately $28,000 annually. His wife did not \nwork from 1993 to 1999. She began attending community college in 1999. In 2000, \nApplicant began getting behind in repaying his student loans. His elderly parents had \nimmigrated to the United States in 2000 and were living with him. They lived with him until \n2016. They are now in a senior facility, and he provides monthly support for them. In 2001, \nApplicant filed bankruptcy and had his debts discharged, except for his student loans. No \nother debts are alleged in the SOR, except his student loans. (Tr. 39-50, 111-112; GE 5) \nFrom 1998 to 2010, Applicant continued to work at the car rental agency. He \ncompleted courses and earned certificates in his area of study. In 2010, Applicant found \na job in his field. His wife also graduated from college and started working in 2012. From \n2010 to 2015, Applicant worked for private companies. In 2015, he began working on a \ngovernment contract. (Tr. 48-54; AE AA) \nApplicant credibly testified that after he graduated from college, he made the \nminimum payments towards his student loans for two years. He then continued to make \npayments. The amount was less than the minimum payment required, but was what he \ncould afford at the time. He testified his payments were consistent, but he skipped a \ncouple payments in 2013. In 2015, he began earning more money and increased his \npayments, but was not caught up. He provided documents to show the payments he made \nfrom 2013 through January 2021. (Tr. 54-57, 67-68, 103-105; Answer; AE O. P, Q) \nIn 2017, Applicant\u2019s daughter began attending college.

His daughter graduated this year and will \napply to medical school after taking a gap year. Applicant testified that his daughter will \nbe responsible for her graduate school expenses. (Tr. 61-64) \nIn 2016, Applicant completed a security clearance application (SCA) and did not \ndisclose he was behind on his student loans. He testified that he thought because he was \nmaking payments he did not have to disclose the student loans. He said the financial \nsection of the SCA had things that did not apply to him and because the questions were \ngrouped together he believed he was answering correctly. He was aware that the \nbackground investigation process would access his credit reports. He was not interviewed \nby a government investigator as part of his background investigation. Because he was \ngranted a security clearance, he believed there were no issues regarding his student \nloans and his response. I found his testimony credible. (Tr. 58-61, 64-68, 93-98; AE CC) \nIn April 2019, Applicant completed another SCA. He did not disclose he had any \ndelinquent debts in his SCA. He was interviewed by a government investigator in January \n2020. He explained that he thought he only had to disclose debts that were being \ngarnished. He credibly testified that he believed because he was making payments on \nhis student loans he did not have to disclose them. He explained that there were so many \nsubsections to the different questions he did not have a clear understanding and thought \nif he answered \u201cyes\u201d he was admitting all of the categories. He did not want to say \u201cyes\u201d \nbecause many things did not apply to him. He believed because he was making monthly \npayments, he was not delinquent. English is a second language for Applicant. (Tr. 64-68, \n98-100; GE 1, 4) \nIn his answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted the allegation in \u00b6 2.a that alleged \nhe deliberately failed to disclose his delinquent student loans on her 2019 SCA. Applicant \ntestified that he initially was going to deny the allegation. He then sought advice from his \nemployer\u2019s corporate attorney on how to answer and was advised it was better to respond \n\u201cyes\u201d and then provide an explanation. This attorney did not have experience in security \nclearances. Applicant believed he received incorrect advice. The attorney acknowledged \nher inexperience in the area of security clearances and referred Applicant to his present \nattorney. When he responded, he did not think he was admitting that he deliberately failed \nto provide accurate information. I found Applicant\u2019s explanations credible. I believe he \nmade an honest mistake, received incorrect advice, and did not deliberately fail to \ndisclose the status of his student loans. (Tr. 99-103; Answer to SOR) \nApplicant testified that in February 2020, after his background interview, he \ncontacted the Department of Education (DOE) regarding bringing his loans current. He \nwas told he could pay the total amount owed or participate in a rehabilitation program. It \ntook months for his rehabilitation program to be approved. He continued to make his \npayments while waiting for DOE to respond. His application was approved in January \n2021. He is to make payments of $796 a month. He made his first payment in January \n2021, and also paid an additional $250. He was advised in February 2021 that his loans \nwere rehabilitated and transferred to a new loan servicer. DOE would contact the credit \nbureaus to delete the record of default from his credit report.

It was extended in September 2021 until January 2022. Applicant resumed \npayments in May 2021 and has made them consistently as required, even though he is \nentitled to have the loans in forbearance. (Tr. 69-84; GE 2, 3, 6; AE A, B, C, D, E, F, G, \nH, I, J, K, L, T, V, W, Z) \nApplicant provided a copy of his current budget, which includes his student loan \npayments. He also provided receipts to show he is timely paying his monthly expenses. \n(AE X) He provides his parents $350 to assist with their expense. Applicant recently took \nclasses so he could become certified as a title insurance inspector and earn additional \nincome. He has been working in this part-time capacity for about four or five months. He \nearns about $400 to $600 a month in this job. His wife has about $15,000 in savings and \nhe has a pension account with about $16,000 in it. Now that his daughter has graduated \nfrom college, his expendable income has increased, and he is more secure financially. \nHe intends to repay his student loans and will do so regardless of his security clearance \nstatus. (Tr. 84-92; 114-115; AE X, DD) \nCharacter witnesses testified on Applicant\u2019s behalf. Both have held security \nclearances for many years and have worked with Applicant. They opined that he is honest \nand truthful and is respected by his coworkers. He has a high level of integrity. Both noted \nthat because English is a second language sometimes it takes him longer to understand \ncertain words. (Tr. 22-39) \n \nCharacter letters from people who have known him for many years attest to \nApplicant\u2019s honesty, truthfulness, and integrity. He is a model coworker and employee \nwho is careful and meticulous regarding his work. He is a valued employee who has a \nstrong work ethic and a loyal commitment to his family. (AE BB) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility, the administrative judge \nmust consider the AG. In addition to brief introductory explanations for each guideline, \nthe adjudicative guidelines list potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating \nconditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified \ninformation. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere \nspeculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 states an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for financial considerations is set out \nin AG & 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nAG \u00b6 19 provides conditions that could raise security concerns. The following are \npotentially applicable: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant had two delinquent student loans that he was unable to pay. There is \nsufficient evidence to support the application of the above disqualifying conditions. \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising \nfrom financial difficulties. The following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially \napplicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; and \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nApplicant had two delinquent student loans. After completing college, he made \nminimum payments for two years until he was unable, so he made lesser payments. He \nprovided documents to show he made payments throughout the years and increased \npayments when he got a better paying job. During this time, he supported his parents \nwho were living with him. He did not believe the loans were a security concern because \nhe was making payments, albeit less than required. When he learned his student loans \nwere a security concern, he immediately contacted DOE, completed the application \nprocess to rehabilitate the loans and is in a repayment plan. He has made consistent \npayments as required and made payments during the COVID-19 forbearance period. \nApplicant was underemployed and taking care of his elderly parents. These were \nconditions beyond his control. He was also providing for his daughter\u2019s education, which \nwas within his control, but is hardly a frivolous expenditure. Applicant did not ignore his \nfinancial obligation to repay his student loans, but rather paid what he could afford at the \ntime. He acted responsibly under the circumstances.

AG \u00b6\u00b6 \n20(a) and 20(d) apply. \nGuideline E: Personal Conduct \nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the security concerns for personal conduct: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process. \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. I find the following potentially applicable: \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar \nform used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, \naward benefits or status, determine security clearance eligibility or \ntrustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities. \nBased on the evidence noted above, I find that Applicant did not deliberately omit, \nconceal, or falsify his SCA by failing to disclose the status of his student loans. I find in \nhis favor under the Personal Conduct Guideline. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuidelines E and F in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were \naddressed under those guidelines, but some warrant additional comment. \nApplicant met his burden of persuasion. He has established a reliable financial \ntrack record. The record evidence leaves me with no questions or doubts as to Applicant\u2019s \neligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For these reasons, I conclude Applicant \nmitigated the security concerns arising under Guideline F, financial considerations and \nrefuted the security concerns raised under Guideline E, personal conduct. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.b: \n \nFor Applicant  \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \n \nFor Applicant  \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly \nconsistent with the national security to grant Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance. \nEligibility for access to classified information is granted. \nCarol G.

The SOR is similar in form and purpose to a complaint, which is the initial \npleading that starts a civil action; in some states this pleading is known as a petition; \nand in criminal law it is a formal charge accusing a person of a criminal offense. Here, \nthe SOR detailed the factual reasons for the action under the security guideline known \nas Guideline F for financial considerations and Guideline H for drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse. \nApplicant answered the SOR admitting the factual allegations, provided a four-\npage memorandum in explanation, and provided several supporting documents \nappended to his answer.

Department Counsel indicated they were ready to proceed on July 6, \n2021. Shortly thereafter, the case was received in the Washington Hearing Office. With \nthe assistance of counsel, Applicant filed a supplemental response or answer to the \nSOR on November 24, 2021. It consists of an 18-page memorandum and numerous \ndocumentary matters (at Tabs A-I) in support of Applicant\u2019s case.

Applicant was called as a witness \nand was subject to cross-examination by Department Counsel. \nExhibit C was admitted pending receipt after the hearing.

He started at the state university via an Army ROTC \nscholarship in September 2009, but had a five-year gap from January 2011 until \nJanuary 2016, when he returned to his studies at the university. He was in the ROTC \nprogram from September 2009 until formally discharged in August 2011. He withdrew \nfrom all classes in January 2011, and his academic standing was subsequently \nchanged to mandatory leave. (Exhibit D) \nA. Applicant\u2019s history of financial problems \nIt is this initial period at the university\u2014more than a decade ago now\u2014that \nresulted in the financial issues in this case. The SOR alleges a history of financial \nproblems consisting of the following: (1) Applicant filed a Chapter 7 bankruptcy case in \nabout October 2014, and he received a discharge in about January 2015; and (2) he is \nindebted to the Defense Department for an account placed for collection in the amount \nof about $34,333. He disclosed both matters in his security clearance application. \n(Exhibit 1 at Section 26) Understanding how these two matters came about requires a \nbit more discussion of Applicant\u2019s initial period at the university. What follows below is \nbased primarily on information provided by Applicant. (Exhibit A at Tab C and Exhibit C) \nApplicant was required to take an official Army Physical Fitness Test (APFT) as \npart of the ROTC program during the Winter Semester 2010. (Tr. 26-28) He passed the \nfirst two events but failed the third when he became ill during the two-mile run. He was \nscheduled to retake the APFT the following week but did not due to an injury incurred \nduring an intramural sporting event. He was eventually informed by the ROTC program \nthat he could retake the APFT during the Fall Semester 2010, which he did \nsuccessfully. In about October or November 2010, Applicant learned that he would not \nreceive the ROTC scholarship money, and that he was responsible for about $18,000 in \ncosts. (Exhibit 2) Applicant believes this occurred because he did not pass the APFT \nduring Winter Semester 2010. \nThis was overwhelming news for the then youthful Applicant. He described the \nloss of the ROTC scholarship sent him into a downward spiral. He shut down, did not \ntell his parents, and stopped attending classes. He finished Fall Semester 2010 with a \nGPA of 0.914, which resulted in loss of the ROTC scholarship. (Exhibit D; Tr. 58-59) He \nreceived both the bill for Fall Semester 2010 and Winter Semester 2011 in January \n2011 and promptly withdrew from all classes for Winter Semester 2011 and withdrew \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nfrom the university to prevent financial liability for the additional semester. His official \ndischarge from the Army ROTC program followed August 2011. (Exhibit B at Appendix \nFB1) Shortly thereafter, he was billed by the Defense Department for his first two \nsemesters (Fall 2009 and Winter 2010) in the ROTC program. The bill was to recoup \nmonies paid for educational expenses paid by the ROTC program. He proposed to \nrepay the bill via active duty enlisted service, but was denied. The financial ramifications \nof these circumstances were a total indebtedness of about $80,000 consisting of \n$20,000 in student loans, $25,000 owed to the university, and $35,000 owed to the \nDefense Department. (Tr. 28) He described the indebtedness as \u201cinsurmountable.\u201d (Tr. \n31) \nAfter withdrawing from the university in January 2011, Applicant began working a \nseries of jobs to support himself. (Tr. 30; Exhibit 1 at Section 13a) The jobs were part-\ntime or full-time and were entry-level jobs in the fields of health care/insurance, \nconstruction, and hospitality (waiter and bartender). He relied on the jobs to pay for his \nliving expenses and attempted to repay the university and the Defense Department, \nalthough it was difficult to make much progress with his low wages. In 2013, his total \nincome was $23,287; in 2014, his total income was $17,603; and in 2015, his total \nincome was $23,976. (Exhibit B at Appendix FA4) He lost his job working at the bar in \nabout September 2013 when the bar flooded, which was his only source of income at \nthe time. (Tr. 33-34) He returned to working at the bar in about April 2014, having \npicked up odd jobs here and there in the meantime. \nShortly thereafter, Applicant decided to seek relief in bankruptcy to resolve the \ndebt owed to the university. He did so because he was unable to make any real \nprogress paying down the indebtedness given his low wages, and he wanted to move \non with his life, return to the university, and have a career. (Tr. 32-33) He filed a Chapter \n7 bankruptcy petition in October 2014, and received a discharge in January 2015. The \nbankruptcy court records show his indebtedness was limited to five debts listed on \nSchedule F (for unsecured nonpriority claims) as follows: (1) a water-utility debt for \n$86.50; (2) a government overpayment (the DFAS debt) for $35,413; (3) a debt to the \nuniversity for $25,821; (4) a student loan for $3,051; and (5) a student loan for $2,165. \n(Exhibit 3 and Exhibit B at Appendix FA1 and Appendix FA2) The January 2015 \nbankruptcy discharge provided relief for the water utility bill (presumably) and the \nuniversity debt, as the other three were not dischargeable in bankruptcy. \nThe university acknowledged the bankruptcy discharge and informed Applicant \nthey had written off his student account debts for tuition and housing. (Exhibit B at \nAppendix FA3) Subsequently in April 2015, Applicant was able to finish making \npayment in full for the two student loans listed in the Chapter 7 bankruptcy case. \n(Exhibit B at Appendix FA 5)   \nThe DFAS debt appears in a January 2019 credit report as a $34,333 collection \naccount. (Exhibit 5) It does not appear in a February 2021 credit report, which reflects \nthe Chapter 7 bankruptcy case but no past-due or collection accounts.

(Exhibit G) Given the age of the DFAS debt, it is \nlikely that it aged off the more recent credit reports.  \nApplicant made irregular, sporadic payments on the DFAS debt. Based on \nrecords he provided, he had a monthly payment of about $1,012 on an account balance \nof $36,376 as of April 2012; he made payments of $50, $50, $100, $100, and $200 \nduring 2012-2014; his account was deemed delinquent by July 2013; his account was in \ndefault by August 2013; and the account balance was $36,207 in November 2013. \n(Exhibit E) \nIn March 2014, the Treasury Department informed Applicant that an income tax \nrefund for $742 had been applied to the DFAS debt. (Exhibit B at Appendix FB2) In \nJune 2014, in response to a garnishment action, Applicant requested a hardship \nhearing with the Treasury Department concerning the debt. (Exhibit B at Appendix FB3) \nThe outcome of the hearing was successful, in part, as Treasury determined that his \nwages could not be garnished at that time, but the debt was otherwise fully enforceable \nin the amount of $46,037 as of July 2014. (Exhibit B at Appendix FB4) A few months \nlater in August 2015, Applicant signed a promissory note (for student deferment on \neducation debts only) with DFAS. (Exhibit B at Appendix FB5) Subsequently, Applicant \nhas made payment on the debt via interception of his annual income tax refund but has \notherwise not provided proof of payments. At some point DFAS closed the collection \naccount, and the debt went into the Treasury\u2019s collection system via the offset program, \nwhich collects past-due (delinquent) debts (e.g., child-support payments) that people \nowe to state and federal agencies. \nApplicant is now seeking relief from the DFAS debt. (Tr. 35-36) Specifically, on \nSeptember 8, 2021, he filed a petition with the U.S. Army Board for Correction of \nMilitary Records (ABCMR) seeking a waiver of recoupment of the educational debt \nincurred via his ROTC scholarship or, in the alternative, reduction of the educational \ndebt to a substantial degree. (Exhibit C) The basis of his dispute is that the ROTC \nofficials did not provide him correct or complete information regarding an option to \nwithdraw from the ROTC contract within the first year without financial liability or \nconsequences (the so-called one-and-done rule). (Tr. 36; Exhibit C) The delay in filing a \npetition with the ABCMR is due to Applicant\u2019s ignorance as a layman, and he became \naware of ABCMR process when he retained counsel. (Tr. 35-36) The petition was \npending before the ABCMR at the time of the hearing in this case and it is expected to \ntake some time before the petition is acted upon. \nApplicant\u2019s current financial situation is now much improved. His entry-level \nsalary w\n ith his current employer was $60,000 and it has since increased to $93,000. (Tr. \n67) He\u2019s taken steps to educate himself in the field of personal finance and completed \nonline financial education or counseling courses. (Tr. 37-38; Exhibit A at Tab G) He \nused a motorcycle when he relocated for his current job, which allowed him to delay \nbuying a new car. (Tr. 40-41) He does not carry a balance on credit card accounts. \n(Exhibits G and I) He repaid two student loans before he returned to the university, and \nhe is current with his student loans now. As of March 2021, he had made all required \npayments for 114 consecutive months.

Applicant\u2019s history of drug involvement and substance misuse \nApplicant disclosed a history of drug involvement and substance misuse in his \nsecurity clearance application. (Exhibit 1 at Section 23) He did so because it was the \nright thing to do. (Tr. 75) He provided additional information during his background \ninvestigation. (Exhibit 2) His primary drug of choice was marijuana, which he used from \nabout July 2008 to about September 2018. He was introduced to marijuana through a \nfriend in high school. He denied using marijuana at the university when he was in the \nROTC program. (Tr. 60-61) He explained that before returning to the university, he \nworked in a college bar where people would frequently decompress after work, which \ninvolved using marijuana multiple times per week. After he returned to the university in \nJanuary 2016, he used marijuana almost every day in the evenings as a way to deal \nwith stress, as a sleep aid, and in social settings too. He described himself as a regular \nuser of marijuana during 2016, 2017, and for about half of 2018. (Tr. 50, 68-69) His \ninvolvement with marijuana included purchasing it about once a month, but he never \nsold it. (Tr. 69) \nIn addition to marijuana, Applicant disclosed using cocaine and Ecstasy, and he \nreported misusing (without a prescription) the medications Adderall, Vyvanse, and \nRitalin. (Exhibit 1) He estimated using cocaine about a half a dozen times from about \nMarch 2012 to May 2015. He described his cocaine use as sporadic. It occurred when \nhe was offered cocaine by acquaintances, and he used it by \u201cgumming it\u201d as opposed to \nsnorting it. He never purchased cocaine and he never sought it out. He used Ecstasy \nonce in 2015 when he attended a music festival. He used it with a friend who wanted to \nuse it at the time. He misused the medications during 2010-2018. He used them as a \nstudy aid to help him complete school work and study for exams. \nApplicant\u2019s last instance of illegal drug involvement occurred in September 2018. \nHe used marijuana during that month, but stopped after notified that he had a job \ninterview with his current employer. (Tr. 42-43) He explained that he quickly realized the \npotential of the prospective job and did not want to do anything to ruin or jeopardize it. \nHe has never failed a drug test, including the pre-employment drug test he took for his \ncurrent job. (Tr. 61, 77) He also expressed a good understanding of his employer\u2019s \ndrug-free workplace policy, to include that it prohibits off-duty illegal drug use too. (Tr. \n77-78) He self-referred for a substance-use-disorders evaluation in November 2021. \nThe results were favorable as the evaluation concluded that he did not meet diagnostic \ncriteria for any substance. (Exhibit A at Tab I) \nApplicant noted that his girlfriend, who holds a security clearance, is wholly \nagainst marijuana use as well as illegal drug use in general. (Tr. 78) In addition, he has \ndissociated himself from negative influences, including illegal drugs. (Exhibit A at Tab C, \n\u00b6 6) He also submitted a number of declarations from family, friends, and co-workers. \nThe family members are two younger brothers, one of whom is an active duty Army \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                          \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nofficer and the other is a student enrolled at a U.S. military academy. His supporters \nspeak emphatically about his many favorable character traits and profess that previous \ndrug involvement is a thing of the past. \nApplicant intends to continue to refrain from illegal drug use or substance \nmisuse of any kind. To that end, he executed a signed statement of intent wherein he \npromised not to illegally use any drugs, to include marijuana, in the future; and he \nfurther agreed that any such violation shall be grounds for automatic revocation of any \nsecurity clearance. (Exhibit A at Tab H) \nLaw and Policies \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (E.O.) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of \nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review \nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the National Security \nAdjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information or \nEligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position (AG), effective June 8, 2017. \nIt is well-established law that no one has a right to a security clearance.1 As \nnoted by the Supreme Court in Department of the Navy v. Egan, \u201cthe clearly consistent \nstandard indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the \nside of denials.\u201d2 Under Egan, Executive Order 10865, and the Directive, any doubt \nabout whether an applicant should be allowed access to classified information will be \nresolved in favor of protecting national security. In Egan, the Supreme Court stated that \nthe burden of proof is less than a preponderance of evidence.3 The Appeal Board has \nfollowed the Court\u2019s reasoning, and a judge\u2019s findings of fact are reviewed under the \nsubstantial-evidence standard.4 \nThere is no presumption in favor of granting, renewing, or continuing eligibility for \naccess to classified information.5 Under the Directive, the parties have the following \nburdens: (1) Department Counsel has the burden of presenting evidence to establish \nfacts alleged in the SOR that have been controverted; (2) an applicant is responsible for \npresenting evidence to refute, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts that have been \nadmitted or proven; and (3) an applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain \na favorable clearance decision.6 \n1 Department of the Navy v.

The overall concern is set forth in AG \n\u00b6 18 as follows: \nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. . .. \nThe concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified or sensitive information to obtain money or something else of \nvalue. It encompasses concerns about a person\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other \nimportant qualities. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified or sensitive \ninformation. \nIn analyzing the facts of this case, I considered the following disqualifying \nconditions as most pertinent: \nAG \u00b6 19(a) inability to satisfy debts; and  \nAG \u00b6 19(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations.  \nThe evidence supports a conclusion that Applicant has a history of financial \nproblems or difficulties that is sufficient to raise a security concern under Guideline F. \nThe disqualifying conditions noted above apply. \nLikewise, in analyzing the facts of this case, I considered the following mitigating \nconditions as most pertinent: \nAG \u00b6 20(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not\ncast doubt on the [person\u2019s] current reliability, trustworthiness, or good\njudgment; \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were \nlargely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual act responsibly under the circumstances; and \nAG \u00b6 20(e) the [person] has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy \nof the past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \nThe mitigating condition at AG \u00b6 20(a) applies in Applicant\u2019s favor. His history of \nfinancial problems arose due to his participation in an Army ROTC program during \n2009-2010 and subsequent disenrollment therefrom under circumstances that resulted \nin \u201cinsurmountable\u201d debt, as characterized by Applicant. (Tr. 31) It no longer casts doubt \non his current security suitability in light of the fact that Chapter 7 bankruptcy case \noccurred several years ago (2014-2015) and has not recurred. Applicant is also taking \nlawful, legitimate steps to dispute the DFAS debt. Moreover, Applicant has affirmatively \ndemonstrated that recurrence is a low-probability event by returning to the university in \n2016 and graduating in 2018, which did not result in similar financial problems. \nThe mitigating condition at AG \u00b6 20(b) also applies. The conditions that resulted \nin Applicant\u2019s financial problems during 2009-2010 were largely beyond the control of \nthe then youthful and inexperienced Applicant. He was unaware of the so-called one-\nand-done rule for ROTC cadets and therefore was unable to take advantage of it to \navoid financial liability. Likewise, he has acted responsibly under the circumstances. \nFirst, after withdrawing from the university in January 2011, he had a series of low-wage \njobs to support himself and used any extra money to repay debt (e.g., two student loans \nwere paid off in 2015 and he made irregular payments on the DFAS debt). Second, \npayments were also made on the DFAS debt by interception of Applicant\u2019s annual \nfederal income tax refund, which is not considered a purely voluntary payment. Still, \nApplicant deserves a bit of credit; after all, he earned the money that was intercepted. \nThird, he used a Chapter 7 bankruptcy to resolve a large debt owed to the university \nafter concluding he had no other viable options given his low wages. This provided him \nwith a \u201cfresh start\u201d as contemplated by bankruptcy law, although the DFAS debt was not \ndischargeable. Fourth, he then put himself in a position to return to the university in \nJanuary 2016, continued working part-time jobs, and earned an engineering degree in \nDecember 2018. Given these circumstances, I conclude Applicant acted responsibly. \nThe mitigating condition at AG \u00b6 20(e) applies to the outstanding DFAS debt. As \ndetailed in the petition to the ABCMR, Applicant is disputing the debt, or seeking a \nsubstantial reduction of the debt, because he claims he should have been permitted to \nwithdraw from the ROTC program within the first year without financial consequences, \nbut he was not informed of that fact. (Exhibit C). I make no findings or conclusions \nconcerning the procedural correctness or merits of his ABCMR petition, which are \nbeyond the scope of this case. But his petition is sufficient establish a reasonable basis \nto dispute the DFAS debt within the meaning of AG \u00b6 20(e). \nOverall, I was impressed by Applicant\u2019s grit and persistence to overcome a \ndifficult situation. Some people would have simply given up. Applicant buckled down \nand worked low-wage jobs, paid what he was able to pay, used the lawful process of \nbankruptcy to resolve one debt, and then returned to the same university where his \nfinancial problems began. He earned an engineering degree allowing him to transition \nfrom low-wage jobs to the white-collar workforce. It is also apparent that Applicant is \nconducting his current financial affairs responsibly.

And this case is an example of why that is so. Overall, there is \nsufficient evidence to explain and mitigate his history of financial problems. Accordingly, \nthe matters under Guideline F are decided for Applicant. \nUnder Guideline H for drug involvement and substance misuse, the concern as \nset forth in AG \u00b6 24 is that: \n[t]he illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescriptions and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose, can raise questions about an \nindividual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior \nmay lead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. . . .  \nIn addition to the above matters, I note that the Director of National Intelligence \n(DNI), acting in his capacity as the Security Executive Agent (SecEA), issued an \nOctober 25, 2014 memorandum concerning adherence to federal laws prohibiting \nmarijuana use. In doing so, the DNI emphasized three things. First, no state can \nauthorize violations of federal law, including violations of the Controlled Substances Act, \nwhich identifies marijuana as a Schedule I controlled drug. Second, changes to state \nlaws (and the laws of the District of Columbia) concerning marijuana use do not alter the \nnational security adjudicative guidelines. And third, a person\u2019s disregard of federal law \nconcerning the use, sale, or manufacture of marijuana remains relevant when making \neligibility decisions for sensitive national security positions. \nThe DNI recently updated or clarified guidance for marijuana-related issues in \nsecurity clearance adjudications via a December 21, 2021 memorandum, which states \nin pertinent part the following: \n[Federal] agencies are instructed that prior recreational marijuana \nuse by an individual may be relevant to adjudications but not \ndeterminative. The SecEA has provided direction in [the adjudicative \nguidelines] to agencies that requires them to use a \"whole-person \nconcept.\" This requires adjudicators to carefully weigh a number of \nvariables in an individual's life to determine whether that individual's \nbehavior raises a security concern, if at all, and whether that concern has \nbeen mitigated such that the individual may now receive a favorable \nadjudicative determination. Relevant mitigations include, but are not \nlimited to, frequency of use and whether the individual can demonstrate \nthat future use is unlikely to recur, including by signing an attestation or \nother such appropriate mitigation. Additionally, in light of the long-standing \nfederal law and policy prohibiting illegal drug use while occupying a \nsensitive position or holding a security clearance, agencies are \nencouraged to advise prospective national security workforce employees \nthat they should refrain from any future marijuana use upon initiation of the \n10 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                          \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \nnational security vetting process, which commences once the individual \nsigns the certification contained in the Standard Form 86 (SF 86), \nQuestionnaire for National Security Positions.7   \nIn analyzing the facts of this case, I considered the following disqualifying and \nmitigating conditions as most pertinent: \nAG \u00b6 25(a) any substance misuse; \nAG \u00b6 25(c) illegal possession of a controlled substance, including \ncultivation, processing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or \npossession of drug paraphernalia; \nAG \u00b6 26(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \nhappened under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not\ncast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good\njudgment; and  \n \n \nAG \u00b6 26(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this \nproblem, and has established a pattern of abstinence, including but not \nlimited to: (1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; (2) \nchanging or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; and (3) \nproviding a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug involvement \nand substance misuse, acknowledging that any future involvement or \nmisuse is grounds of revocation of national security eligibility. \nI have considered the totality of Applicant\u2019s drug involvement and substance \nmisuse as outlined in the findings of fact, including his last known marijuana usage in \nSeptember 2018. The date is significant because it preceded his entry into the defense-\nindustry workforce, and it preceded his application for a security clearance, in which he \ndisclosed his drug involvement. Had his drug involvement continued after submitting his \nDecember 2018 SF 86, I probably would have decided the Guideline H matters \ndifferently. \nAddressing the individual drugs, Applicant misused the prescription medications \nas a study aid and that misuse ended in about April 2018. His illegal use of Ecstasy \noccurred once in 2015, which is more than five years ago. His sporadic use of cocaine \nwas limited to about a half a dozen times during 2012-2015, which was also more than \nfive years ago. His illegal use of marijuana was prolonged over about a decade until it \nended in September 2018. He was a frequent or regular user of marijuana during 2016, \n2017, and for about half of 2018. He also purchased marijuana. I view his prolonged \n7 SecEA Clarifying Guidance Concerning Marijuana for Agencies Conducting Adjudications of Persons \nProposed for Eligibility for Access to Classified Information or Eligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position, dated \nDecember 21, 2021, at page 2.  \n11 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                          \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \ninvolvement with marijuana as the most serious matter. The disqualifying conditions \nnoted above apply. \nAlthough Applicant\u2019s past use of marijuana and other drug misconduct raise a \nsecurity concern, these matters should be put in perspective. The Appeal Board has \nmade multiple favorable decisions in cases involving applicants with long-term or \nsignificant histories of marijuana involvement. For example, in 1998, the Appeal Board \naffirmed a favorable decision for a 41-year-old applicant with a 24-year history of \nmarijuana use, who had used marijuana during his military service, and who had used \nmarijuana after being granted a security clearance.8 Second, in 1999, the Appeal Board \naffirmed a favorable decision for a 37-year-old applicant who started using marijuana at \na party in 1996, and used marijuana one to two times daily for three months in 1998.9  \nThird, again in 1999, the Appeal Board affirmed a favorable decision for a 28-year-old \napplicant who smoked marijuana nine months before the record closed, who smoked \nmarijuana over a ten-year-period, and who smoked marijuana while working as a \nsecurity professional in violation of his employer\u2019s policy.10  And fourth, in 2004, the \nAppeal Board reversed an unfavorable decision against a 50-year-old applicant with a \n28-year history (1996 to December 1997) of regular, although occasional, marijuana \nuse culminating in his arrest for drug-related criminal conduct.11  Applicant\u2019s marijuana \ninvolvement and other drug misconduct, while a 20-something student or working in the \nsame college town, does not rise to the same level or degree of seriousness as noted in \nthe four cases above.   \nThe DNI\u2019s clarified guidance is also informative, as the facts and circumstances \nhere appear to align with that guidance. To review, Applicant smoked marijuana for a \nprolonged period; he was a frequent or regular marijuana user for two to three years; he \nstopped using marijuana in September 2018 upon notification of a job interview in the \ndefense industry; he disclosed his marijuana use and other drug involvement in his \nsecurity clearance application; he cooperated during the security-clearance process; \nand, significantly, he has abstained from marijuana use or other drug misconduct for \nmore than three years (September 2018-January 2022). \nConsistent with the DNI\u2019s guidance, Applicant refrained from any future \nmarijuana use upon initiation of the national security vetting process, which commences \nonce the individual signs the certification contained in the SF 86. Actually, his drug \nmisconduct ceased a couple of months before he signed the SF 86. He is now working \n8 ISCR Case No. 97-0803 (App. Bd.

He also \nsigned an appropriate attestation of non-use. Overall, Applicant persuaded me that he \nwill continue to refrain from marijuana use and any other substance misuse and that his \ndrug misconduct is safely in the past. The mitigating conditions noted above apply. \nAccordingly, the matters under Guideline H are decided for Applicant. \nFollowing Egan and the clearly consistent standard, I have no doubts or \nconcerns about Applicant\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, good judgment, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. In reaching this conclusion, I weighed the \nevidence as a whole and considered if the favorable evidence outweighed the \nunfavorable evidence or vice versa. I also considered the whole-person concept. I \nconclude that he has met his ultimate burden of persuasion to show that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant him eligibility for access to classified \ninformation. \nFormal Findings \nThe formal findings on the SOR allegations are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.b: \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline H: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 2.a \u2013 2.f: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIt is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for \naccess to classified information.

His employer has sponsored \nApplicant for a top secret security clearance in order that he may perform specific job \nduties. (Tr. 9-10, 16-20; GE 1) \nIn his January 2018 SCA, Applicant disclosed that he had previously used \nmarijuana intermittently from June 1973 to September 2013, approximately a few times \na year. He listed that he did not intend to use marijuana in the future because he did not \nlike marijuana and his lifestyle had changed when he remarried in 2013. (Tr. 19-21; GE \n2) \nIn Applicant\u2019s April 2020 SCA, he disclosed that he continued his use of \nmarijuana a couple times a year from 2013 to December 2019. He also listed that he \nhad smoked marijuana with friends after a mass shooting took place in August 2019. At \nthe hearing, Applicant testified that he continued to use marijuana due to certain \nemotional triggers; such as the anniversary of 9/11, and after a mass shooting took \nplace near his residence in 2019. He and his friends have consistently visited a historic \narea of bars and restaurants for more than 30 years where the mass shooting occurred, \nand they were traumatized by the event. From August 2019 to December 2019, he used \nmarijuana more frequently with friends and family to deal with the trauma. In December \n2019, he purchased marijuana at a bar in this historic district. (Tr. 21-25; GE 1) \nOn May 8, 2018, Applicant participated in a background interview with an \nauthorized DOD investigator. Applicant provided details about his use of marijuana up \nto January 2013.

He \nadmitted marijuana use, on a yearly basis, from June 1973 to December 2019. He \nclarified, however, that he used marijuana on a \u201cweekly\u201d basis from August 2019 \nthrough December 2019. He used marijuana more frequently with friends following the \nmass shooting near his residence. He stated that he purchased marijuana from a \nstranger in late 2019. He reported that he did not intend to use marijuana in the future. \n(Tr. 27; GE 4) \nDuring the March 2022 hearing, Applicant admitted that he had most recently \nused marijuana a \u201chandful\u201d of times between his May 2020 interview and early 2022. He \nhad also purchased marijuana once since 2019. Applicant acknowledged that he was \naware, at the time of his conduct, that using and purchasing illegal drugs while \npossessing a security clearance was prohibited. In January 2021, Applicant submitted a \nstatement of intent to abstain from future marijuana use; however, Applicant candidly \ntestified that he had used marijuana as recently as early 2022 and it was unlikely he \nwould abstain from using marijuana in the future. He has never participated in a drug \ncounseling or treatment program. (Tr. 24-29; GE 3) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the AG. In addition to brief introductory explanations \nfor each guideline, the AG list potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating \nconditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified \ninformation. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 an \u201capplicant is responsible \nfor presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate \nfacts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the ultimate \nburden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk that an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline H: Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse is set out in AG \u00b6 24: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior \nmay lead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations.  \nAG \u00b6 25 provides three conditions that could raise a security concern and may \nbe disqualifying in this case: \u201c(a) any substance misuse (see above definition);\u201d \u201c(c) \nillegal possession of a controlled substance, including cultivation, processing, \nmanufacture, purchase, . . . .;\u201d and \u201c(f) any illegal drug use while granted access to \nclassified information or holding a sensitive position.\u201d The record establishes AG \u00b6\u00b6 \n25(a), 25(c), and 25(f). \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns \narising from drug involvement and substance misuse. The following mitigating \nconditions under AG \u00b6 26 are potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \nand \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, provides evidence of actions to overcome the problem, \nand has established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not limited to: \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were being \nused; and \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that any future \ninvolvement or misuse is grounds for revocation of national security \neligibility. \nNone of the mitigating conditions apply. Applicant\u2019s last use of marijuana \noccurred in early 2022 while he possessed a DOD security clearance. He failed to \nabstain from marijuana involvement despite acknowledging using or purchasing illegal \ndrugs is conduct in violation of Federal law. He has not changed his environment or \ndisassociated from friends and family who use marijuana. In January 2021, he \nsubmitted a \u201cstatement of intent\u201d to abstain from all drug involvement and substance \nmisuse in the future, but he testified that he had continued to use marijuana until early \n2022. He candidly admitted that it was unlikely he would abstain from using marijuana in \nthe future. Applicant failed to mitigate the drug involvement and substance misuse \nsecurity concerns. \nGuideline E: Personal Conduct \nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the security concern for personal conduct: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. . . .  \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. The following disqualifying conditions are potentially applicable: \n(e) personal conduct\u2026 that creates a vulnerability to exploitation, \nmanipulation, or duress, such as \n(1) engaging in activities which, if known, may affect the \nperson's personal, professional, or community standing . . .; \nand \n(g) association with persons involved in criminal activity. \nGuideline H allegations \u00b6\u00b6 1.b and 1.d are cross-alleged under Guideline E \u00b6 2.a. \nEach of them is established by the record evidence. Applicant has continued to use and \npurchase marijuana while in possession of a security clearance, despite acknowledging \nsuch conduct is in violation of Federal law. He has not disassociated with friends or \nfamily members who use marijuana. AG \u00b6\u00b6 16(e)(1), and 16(g) apply. \nAG \u00b6 17 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns in this case: \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, \nunreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely \nto recur; and \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate \nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress. \nNone of the mitigating conditions apply to Applicant\u2019s continued use and \npurchase of marijuana while possessing a DOD security clearance. Applicant\u2019s \nmarijuana use, despite knowing such use violated Federal law, continues to cast doubt \non his reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. The personal conduct security \nconcerns are not mitigated. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments \nunder Guidelines H and E in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 \n2(d) were addressed under that guideline, but some warrant additional comment. \nApplicant\u2019s use of marijuana while holding a security clearance places a heavy \nburden on him to establish mitigation. It is well settled that once a concern arises \nregarding an applicant\u2019s security clearance eligibility, there is a strong presumption \nagainst granting a security clearance. See Dorfmont, 913 F. 2d at 1401. \u201c[A] favorable \nclearance decision means that the record discloses no basis for doubt about an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\u201d ISCR Case No. 18-02085 at 7 \n(App. Bd. Jan. 3, 2020) (citing ISCR Case No. 12-00270 at 3 (App. Bd. Jan. 17, 2014)). \nAfter considering the record as a whole, to include the circumstances \nsurrounding Applicant\u2019s use and purchase of marijuana, I conclude that Applicant has \nnot met his heavy burden of proof and persuasion due to the recency of his last use of \nmarijuana while holding a DOD security clearance. He is uncertain whether he will be \nable to abstain from marijuana use in the future, which continues to cast doubt on his \nreliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. For all these reasons, I conclude \nApplicant failed to mitigate the security concerns arising under Guideline H and \nGuideline E. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline H:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.d: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline E: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n                                            \n \n \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.a: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national security to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for \na security clearance.

Based on the \nresults of the ensuing background investigation, adjudicators for the Defense \nCounterintelligence and Security Agency Consolidated Adjudications Facility (DCSA \nCAF) could not make an affirmative determination that it is clearly consistent with the \ninterests of national security for Applicant to continue to have access to classified \ninformation.

Adjudicators \napplied the adjudicative guidelines (AG) issued by the Director of National Intelligence \n(DNI) on December 10, 2016, and effective for all adjudications on or after June 8, 2017. \nApplicant timely responded to the SOR (Answer) and requested a decision without \na hearing. On March 15, 2022, as provided for by paragraph E3.1.7 of the Directive, \nDepartment Counsel for the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a \nFile of Relevant Material (FORM) containing nine exhibits (Items 1 \u2013 9) on which the \nGovernment relies to support the SOR allegations. \nApplicant received the FORM on May 2, 2022, and was informed she had 30 days \nfrom receipt of the FORM to submit additional information. She did not submit anything \nfurther, and the record closed on June 1, 2022. I received the case for decision on August \n4, 2022. \nFindings of Fact \nUnder Guideline F, the SOR alleged that Applicant owes $112,860 for 26 \ndelinquent debts (SOR 1.a \u2013 1.z). In response to the SOR, she admitted with explanation \nthe allegations at 1.a \u2013 1.v, and denied with explanations the debts at 1.x \u2013 1.z. (FORM, \nItems 1 and 2) In addition to the facts established by Applicant\u2019s admissions, I make the \nfollowing findings of fact. \nApplicant is 57 years old and is sponsored for a security clearance by a prospective \nemployer, a federal contractor. Since October 2018, she has worked for a different \ncompany; however, it is not clear from the record if that company is also a federal \ncontractor. She is single, but was previously married eight times between May 1984 and \nNovember 2014, when she and her most recent husband divorced. One marriage ended \nwhen she was widowed in April 2004. She has three adult children. (FORM, Items 3 and \n4) \nWith the exception of SOR 1.x and 1.y, available information supports all of the \nallegations in the SOR. (FORM, Items 2 \u2013 7) Credit reports show that most of the debts \nlisted in the SOR have been delinquent since 2016 or 2017. Applicant asserted in \nresponse to the SOR that her financial problems stem from her most recent divorce in \n2014. During her personal subject interview (PSI) on March 30, 2020, she stated her \nfinances also were adversely impacted between June and October 2018, when she had \nto leave her job in State A and travel to State B to care for her mother. Applicant had little \nor no income during that time, but was rehired when she returned to State A. \nApplicant also averred that she is now getting her finances in order. To that end, \nshe claims she had multiple properties voluntarily repossessed. She did not specify what \nthose properties were. Additionally, on January 22, 2021, she filed a Chapter 7 \nbankruptcy petition through which she declared $104,259 in liabilities against $9,750 in \nassets. She listed the creditors from SOR 1.a \u2013 1.w, and 1.z in her petition, and she was \ndischarged of debts totaling $104,259.

(FORM, \nItems 8 and 9) \nSOR 1.x and 1.y allege Applicant has two State A tax liens filed against her in \nAugust 2017 ($1,012) and September 2012 ($859), respectively. She denied both \nallegations, claiming they both have been paid in full, SOR 1.x since 2017. To establish \nthese controverted issues of fact, the Government presented undated printouts from the \nLexisNexis reporting system. It is not clear from that information what type of taxes were \nthe subject of the liens. The LexisNexis documents also include a disclaimer regarding \nthe accuracy of the information being reported: \nImportant: The Public Records and commercially available data sources \nused on reports have errors. Data is sometimes entered poorly, processed \nincorrectly and is generally not free from defect. This system should not be \nrelied upon as definitively accurate. Before relying on any data this system \nsupplies, it should be independently verified. For Secretary of State \ndocuments, the following data is for information purposes only and is not an \nofficial record. Certified copies may be obtained from that individual state\u2019s \nDepartment of State. (FORM, Item 7) \nThe debts at SOR 1.x and 1.y do not appear in either the March or December 2020 \ncredit reports included in the FORM. Further, the tax liens were not discussed, as were \nall of the other debts (including the civil judgment at SOR 1.z, which Applicant also denied) \nat issue here, during the PSI. Finally, after the trustee in Applicant\u2019s bankruptcy completed \nhis due diligence review of Applicant\u2019s liabilities and assets, the State A tax liens were not \nlisted in the Chapter 7 bankruptcy petition. On balance, I conclude the FORM does not \ncontain sufficient information to establish SOR 1.x and 1.y. (FORM, Items 2 and 4 \u2013 9) \nThe civil judgment at SOR 1.z was included in Applicant\u2019s bankruptcy petition. \nDuring her PSI ten months earlier, Applicant stated that she did not intend to pay that \njudgment. (FORM, Items 4, 8 and 9) \nApplicant did not provide any current information about her income and expenses. \nShe also did not provide information showing that she has sought financial counseling or \nother assistance in managing her personal finances. She completed financial counseling \nonly as a prerequisite of filing for bankruptcy protection; however, she did not show how \nthat counseling may have helped her correct her financial problems. (FORM, Items 8 and \n9) \nPolicies \nEach security clearance decision must be a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndetermination based on examination of all available relevant and material information, \nand consideration of the pertinent criteria and adjudication policy in the adjudicative \nguidelines (AG). (See Directive, 6.3) Decisions must also reflect consideration of the \nfactors listed in AG \u00b6 2(d). Commonly referred to as the \u201cwhole-person\u201d concept, those \nfactors are: \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(1) The nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nThe presence or absence of a disqualifying or mitigating condition is not \ndeterminative of a conclusion for or against an applicant. However, specific applicable \nguidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against them as they \nrepresent policy guidance governing the grant or denial of access to classified \ninformation. A security clearance decision is intended only to resolve whether it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest for an applicant to either receive or continue to have \naccess to classified information. (Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518 (1988)) \nThe Government bears the initial burden of producing admissible information on \nwhich it based the preliminary decision to deny or revoke a security clearance for an \napplicant. Additionally, the Government must be able to prove controverted facts alleged \nin the SOR. If the Government meets its burden, it then falls to the applicant to refute, \nextenuate or mitigate the Government\u2019s case. Because no one has a \u201cright\u201d to a security \nclearance, an applicant bears a heavy burden of persuasion. (See Egan, 484 U.S. at 528, \n531) A person who has access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship \nwith the Government based on trust and confidence. Thus, the Government has a \ncompelling interest in ensuring each applicant possesses the requisite judgment, \nreliability and trustworthiness of one who will protect the national interests as his or her \nown. The \u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d standard compels resolution of any \nreasonable doubt about an applicant\u2019s suitability for access in favor of the Government. \n(See Egan; AG \u00b6 2(b)) \nAnalysis \nFinancial Considerations \nAvailable information supports the allegations that Applicant accumulated \nsignificant personal debt that has been past-due or delinquent since at least 2016. This \ninformation reasonably raises the security concerns articulated, in relevant part, at AG \u00b6 \n18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. . . . An individual who is financially \noverextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or otherwise \nquestionable acts to generate funds. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAs noted, the tax liens alleged at SOR 1.x and 1.y are resolved for Applicant. The \nrecord evidence as a whole shows she did not take any discernable action to resolve her \ndebts until January 2021. As to one of her larger debts \u2013 the $39,000 civil judgment \naddressed at SOR 1.z \u2013 she told a government investigator in 2020 that she did not intend \nto pay that debt. \nThe Government\u2019s information requires application of the following AG \u00b6 19 \ndisqualifying conditions: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts;  \n(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nI also have considered the following pertinent AG \u00b6 20 mitigating conditions: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; and \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nApplicant\u2019s admissions in response to the SOR, as well as the rest of the \nGovernment\u2019s information, presented a prima facie case for disqualification based on the \nremaining 24 of the 26 allegations of delinquent debt. Accordingly, it was incumbent on \nApplicant to present sufficient reliable information on which application of available \nmitigating conditions could be based. She did not do so. The record does not support any \nof the cited mitigating conditions. Applicant claims her latest divorce in 2014 and a four-\nmonth period of unemployment four years ago are to blame for her financial problems. \nShe did not show how those events caused her to amass such a large amount of debt. \nFurther, even if those events are accepted as circumstances beyond her control, she did \nnot establish that she acted responsibly in the face of those circumstances. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                             \n \n \n \nTo show what she has done to resolve her debts, Applicant relies mainly on the \ndischarge of more than $104,000 of debt through Chapter 7 bankruptcy. While such a \nresponse may, in some circumstances, be reasonable, it should only be undertaken after \nall other reasonable options have been exhausted. Applicant did not establish that, from \nthe time her debts became delinquent (between 2016 and 2018) and the filing of her \nbankruptcy petition in 2021, she made any good-faith efforts to resolve any of her debts. \nIndeed, she expressed her unwillingness to pay or otherwise resolve the civil judgment \nat SOR 1.z. Her debts are multiple and recent, insofar as they went unaddressed until \njust over a year ago. She has not shown that her current finances are sound or that she \nis managing her finances so as to avoid similar financial problems in the future. \nIn summary, Applicant did not meet her burden of persuasion to overcome the \nGovernment\u2019s case for disqualification from access to classified information. I also have \nreviewed the record before me in the context of the whole-person factors listed in AG \u00b6 \n2(d). Applicant\u2019s financial problems and her failure to respond thereto until early 2021, \nwell after she was interviewed about her debts in 2020, reinforce the doubts about her \njudgment, reliability, and trustworthiness that stem from her history of indebtedness. \nBecause protection of the national interest is the principal focus in these adjudications, \nany remaining doubts must be resolved against allowing access to sensitive information. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required by section \nE3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 1.a \u2013 1.w, 1.z: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.x and 1.y: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all available information, it is not clearly consistent with the interests of \nnational security for Applicant to have access to classified information. Applicant\u2019s request \nfor security clearance eligibility is denied. \nMATTHEW E. MALONE \nAdministrative Judge \n6 \n",

(Tr. at 6, 17-18; GE 1) \nThe SOR alleged that Applicant failed to timely file his 2012-2019 federal income \ntax returns, his 2012-2018 state income tax returns for state A, and his 2018-2019 state \nincome tax returns for state B. (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.c). \nApplicant admitted all allegations in his SOR answer. He also disclosed his non-\nfiling of income tax returns to a defense investigator during his May 2020 background\ninvestigation interview. At some point, Applicant submitted to the Government\ndocuments showing that he hired a tax preparation service (TPS) to prepare his non-\nfiled federal and state income tax returns. A July 2020 letter from the TPS indicates that\nit had prepared Applicant\u2019s 2018 federal and both state returns and instructed him on\nthe filing procedure he was to follow. There is no further documentation showing that\nthe 2018 returns were filed. Neither Applicant nor the TPS provided documentation\nconcerning the filing status of the remaining tax years, i.e., 2012-2017, 2019. (Tr. at 19-\n20, 27-28; GE 2; SOR answer)  \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant explained that his tax situation really began in 2008-2009, when he \nrealized he had a tax problem. This was during the time he was either unemployed or \nhe was working low-paying temporary jobs. In 2011, he was hired by a defense \ncontractor for an information technology position. During tax year 2012, he failed to file \nhis federal or state tax returns because he did not have the money to pay his tax debt. \nOnce he did not file for tax year 2012, he continued not to file in succeeding years \nbecause he did not know how to make up for the earlier non-filed years\u2019 returns.

In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(a), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk that an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n3 \n\n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nAG \u00b6 18 expresses the security concerns for financial considerations: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. I have \nconsidered all of them under AG \u00b6 19 and the following potentially applies: \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired. \nApplicant failed to timely file his 2012-2019 federal and two state\u2019s income tax \nreturns. I find the above disqualifying condition is raised. \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns \narising from financial difficulties. I have considered all of the mitigating conditions under \nAG \u00b6 20 and the following potentially apply: \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; and \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n       \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax \nauthority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \nApplicant stated that he failed to file his 2012 tax returns because he could not \nafford the tax debt. From there things snowballed on him. He did not file the succeeding \nyears\u2019 returns because he had not filed the previous returns. He claimed that part of the \nreason he had tax problems was because of his years of underemployment and \nunemployment. However, he failed to establish how that directly impacted his decision \nnot to file multiple years of federal and state tax returns. He provided documentation \nshowing that he hired a TPS to prepare his delinquent federal and state tax returns, but \nhis documentation only showed that tax year 2018 had been prepared, not filed. There \nwas no documentation concerning the remaining tax returns. His non-filing and delay in \nfiling show a lack of reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(b) and \n20(g) do not apply. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guideline and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nrelevant facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 \n2(d) were addressed under that guideline, but some warrant additional comment. \nI considered Applicant\u2019s work history, including his periods of underemployment \nand unemployment, his voluntary disclosure of his unfiled tax returns to the defense \ninvestigator, and his intention to timely file his returns in the future. However, his \nhandling of his tax issues over a multi-year period causes me to question his \ntrustworthiness, reliability, and good judgment. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant has not mitigated the financial considerations. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs: 1.a - 1.c:  \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

He told \nthe investigator that he had recently in the past week filed his 2014, 2015 and 2017 \ndelinquent tax returns. He said he owed approximately $25,000 in federal income taxes \nand was current on his state income taxes. He intended on setting up a payment plan \nwith the IRS to resolve his delinquent taxes and was waiting for his tax returns to be \nprocessed. He explained he failed to timely file his tax returns because he knew he did \nnot have the money to pay what he owed. He reiterated this explanation at his hearing. \nHe said he failed to disclose all of this information on his SCA because he did not think \nabout it when he was completing the questionnaire. (Tr. 61-64, 118; GE 2). \nDuring the interview, Applicant confirmed the bill to the cable company was \nbecause he failed to pay the final bill (SOR \u00b6 1.g). In January 2021, Applicant paid the\namount owed. Regarding the telecommunication bill, he acknowledged he owed the\namount because he terminated his contract (SOR \u00b6 1.f). He had not paid the final balance,\nwhich was owed since 2014, because he did not have the money. At the time of the\ninterview, he had made no effort to pay the account. In January 2021, Applicant paid the\namount owed. Applicant had also not been able to pay the delinquent credit card\ncollection account and had not made any effort to do so at that point. This debt had been\ndelinquent since 2015. (SOR \u00b6 1.a). At his hearing, he provided documents to show in\nJanuary 2021, he reached a settlement with the creditor in SOR \u00b6 1.a. He paid the\nsettlement and received an IRS cancelation of debt FORM 1099C for $671 for tax year\n2020. He was asked if he filed this with his tax return and he responded \u201cno.\u201d He said he\ndid not know he had to file this form with his tax return.

He acknowledged owing the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.e ($3,200) with a past-due balance \nat the time of $800. This debt was for a personal loan he obtained in 2015 to help pay for \nnecessities. He made payments for a period and then in 2016 he was unable to continue \nmaking payments. He made no further effort to resolve it until approximately January \n2021, when he researched the debt and learned the company was no longer in business. \nApplicant provided documents to show he cannot pay the debt due to the company going \nout of business. (Tr. 96, 100-102; AE H) \nDuring Applicant\u2019s interview he acknowledged the charged-off credit card debt in \nSOR \u00b6 1.c ($896). It became delinquent in 2015. He paid the debt in January 2021. The \ndebt in SOR \u00b6 1.b ($1,792) is a credit card collection account. Applicant used this card \nfor a business he was going to start, but did not follow through. He had not made an effort \nto repay the debt at the time of his interview.

(Tr. \n67, 88-90; GE 2, AE L) \nApplicant disclosed in government interrogatories that his 2014 federal tax return \nwas filed in July 2019 and he owed $4,694; 2015 federal tax return was filed in August \n2019 and he owed $4,753; 2016 federal tax return was filed in November 2017 and he \nowed $16.85; 2017 federal tax return was filed in July 2019 and he owed $12,158; 2018 \nfederal tax return was filed in Jun 2019 and he owed $4,593; and 2020 federal income \ntax return was filed in October 2021 and he owed $8,296. At that time, he was not in a \npayment plan with the IRS, but TRS was negotiating with the IRS on his behalf. He \nintended to amend possibly his 2016 and 2018 tax returns because he was living \noverseas and might be entitled to a foreign exemption. It is noted he told the government \ninvestigator during his June 6, 2019 interview that he had already filed his 2014, 2015 \nand 2017 federal income tax returns. It is unknown if Applicant would have received an \nautomatic extension for filing because he was overseas.

In addition, \nhe provided a transcript for payments that were being processed by the IRS for tax years \n2019 and 2018 through a direct deposit made on February 25, 2022, for presumably the \ncurrent balances owed ($9,454 and $2,521, respectively). Also being processed through \nan online account were payments made on February 24, 2022, for tax years 2015 and \n2014 ($4,938 and $4,878 respectively). Presumably, he obtained the funds from the \nequity secured from refinancing his house.

(AE R, S, T) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility, the administrative judge \nmust consider the AG. In addition to brief introductory explanations for each guideline, \nthe adjudicative guidelines list potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating \nconditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified \ninformation. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere \nspeculation or conjecture. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 states an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information).  \nAnalysis \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for financial considerations is set out \nin AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nAG \u00b6 19 provides conditions that could raise security concerns. The following are \npotentially applicable: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts;  \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of ability to do so;  \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and  \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income\ntax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as\nrequired.  \n \n \nApplicant began accumulating delinquent debts in 2014. He failed to timely file his \n2014, 2015 and 2017 federal and state income tax returns. He failed to pay his state \nincome taxes for tax year 2015. He failed to pay his federal income taxes and was \nindebted to the IRS for tax years 2014, 2015, 2017, 2018 and 2019. He did not prioritize \npaying his debts and taxes over other non-necessity expenditures, which shows an \nunwillingness to pay his debts. Applicant filed Chapter 7 bankruptcy in 2005 and had his \ndebts discharged in 2006. There is sufficient evidence to support the application of the \nabove disqualifying conditions. \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising \nfrom financial difficulties. The following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially \napplicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred\nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt\non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control;  \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and  \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority \nto file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \nApplicant attributed his financial problems to a period of unemployment in 2014. \nApplicant repeatedly failed to timely file his federal and state income tax returns for \nmultiple tax years.

He anticipated receiving a foreign exemption for some tax years, but when he \nreturned to the United States, they were negated. He said he lived beyond his means and \nhad become accustomed to receiving the exemption, which allowed him more \nexpendable income. It appears, after working with TRS, he was entitled to an exemption \nand refund for tax year 2017. I have found in his favor for that year. \nApplicant ignored his delinquent debts for six to seven years. He was confronted \nwith these debts during his June 2019 background interview and acknowledged not taking \nany action on them at that time. In a flurry of activity, he eventually paid most of the alleged \ndebts alleged in the SOR in 2021, due to his pending security clearance issues. One of \nthe creditors he owed money went out of business. \nApplicant completed his SCA in April 2019 and disclosed he failed to file and pay \nhis 2014 and 2017 federal and state income tax returns. However, he also failed to timely \nfile his 2015 federal and state income tax return. After completing his SCA, he failed to \ntimely pay his 2018 and 2019 federal taxes. Applicant contracted with TRS in January \n2020, to assist him in resolving his tax issues. The evidence is sufficient to conclude that \nTRS negotiated an installment agreement with the IRS, and Applicant made the required \npayments. Post-hearing, Applicant provided documents to show he had sent payments \nto the IRS to pay what presumably was the balance owed. Those payments were being \nprocessed and it is unknown if they resulted in a zero balance owed on all of Applicant\u2019s \ndelinquent federal taxes. \nThe facts support that Applicant was aware of his delinquent federal and state \nincome tax filings and payments when he completed his SCA in April 2019. There is \ninsufficient evidence that he took any action to resolve these matters before then. He then \nfailed to timely pay his 2018 and 2019 federal income taxes. His conduct shows a pattern \nof irresponsibility regarding his tax obligations. \nApplicant repeatedly failed to pay his delinquent debts and timely file and pay his \nfederal and state income taxes for multiple years. His financial irresponsibility was \nongoing, frequent, and casts doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, and good \njudgment. AG \u00b6 20(a) does not apply. \nApplicant attributed his financial issues to a period of unemployment in 2014 and \nhis belief he was to receive a foreign exemption for certain tax years. His unemployment \nwas beyond his control. I also find that his confusion over his foreign exemption status \nwas complicated, and he had difficulty understanding its applicability. For the full \napplication of AG \u00b6 20(b), Applicant must have acted responsibly under the \ncircumstances. He did not. He failed to pay any of his debts that became delinquent in \n2014 and 2015 until 2021. He also continued to ignore his responsibility to timely file his \ntax returns and, if he was unable to pay, to contact the IRS to participate in a repayment \nplan. AG \u00b6 20(b) has minimal application. \nApplicant sought the assistance of TRS to help him resolve his tax issues. In 2021, \nhe participated in a repayment plan with the IRS.

However, \nI do not know if Applicant no longer has any delinquent tax debts with the IRS, but I believe \nif he does, based on the large payments he recently made, they likely will be minimal. AG \n\u00b6\u00b6 20(c) and 20(g) apply. Applicant\u2019s failure to address his delinquent debts for years and \nthen finally paying them does not constitute a good-faith effort to repay his overdue \ncreditors, but rather reflects a last ditch effort to resolve them after receiving the SOR. AG \n\u00b6 20(d) does not apply. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline F in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were \naddressed under that guideline, but some warrant additional comment. \nApplicant is responsible for ensuring his federal and state income taxes are timely \nfiled and paid. He failed to do so for multiple tax years. After he completed his SCA, he \nagain failed to timely pay his federal income taxes. His explanation was that he did not \nhave the money. He did nothing to address most of his delinquent debts for six to seven \nyears, finally paying them in 2021, after receipt of the SOR. From 2017 to 2019, he \npartially paid for a wedding, purchased a $7,000 ring, and took a vacation to Jamaica. \nApplicant had the resources to pay his debts, but chose not to do so. Applicant\u2019s \ndelinquent tax returns are filed and after his hearing he provided documents to show he \nhas paid his delinquent taxes. \n10 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAn applicant who begins to resolve security concerns only after having been \nplaced on notice that his or her clearance is in jeopardy may lack the judgment and \nwillingness to follow rules and regulations when his or her personal interests are not \nthreatened. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 17-04110 at 3 (App. Bd. Sep. 26, 2019). \nFailure to comply with tax laws suggests that an applicant has a problem with \nabiding by well-established government rules and systems. Voluntary compliance with \nrules and systems is essential for protecting classified information. See, e.g., ISCR Case \nNo. 16-01726 at 5 (App. Bd. Feb. 28, 2018). A person who fails repeatedly to fulfill his or \nher legal obligations, such as filing tax returns and paying taxes when due, does not \ndemonstrate the high degree of good judgment and reliability required of those granted \naccess to classified information. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 17-01382 at 4 (App. Bd. May \n16, 2018). \nApplicant has a long history of financial problems beginning when he filed Chapter \n7 bankruptcy and had his debts discharged in 2006. It is noted that his bankruptcy \ndocuments reflected a tax liability of more than $15,000 at the time. Applicant\u2019s 2014 \nunemployment impacted his finances, but his repeated failure to timely file and address \nhis tax debts continued beyond that period. After completing his SCA in April 2019, he \nbegan to address them. \nApplicant\u2019s history of non-compliance with a fundamental legal obligation to timely \nfile and pay his federal income taxes raises serious concerns. The evidence shows that \nApplicant has likely paid all or most of his tax debts and his delinquent debts. However, \nhe also has an unreliable financial track record. His failure to address his delinquent debts \nfor years and failure to comply with timely filing and paying his income taxes is a serious \nconcern. Although it appears his delinquent debts and federal and state taxes are now \npaid, it does not negate his past irresponsible conduct and noncompliance with his legal \nobligations. These facts cannot be ignored. Therefore, considering all of the evidence, \nand despite some mitigation, it is insufficient to fully mitigate the financial considerations \nsecurity concerns. The record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude Applicant failed to \nmitigate the security concerns arising under Guideline F, financial considerations. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.i: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph   1.j:  \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.k-1.p: \nAgainst Applicant \n11 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national security to grant Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security \nclearance.

She is 50 years old. \nShe is married and she has seven children--five adults and two minors--and six step-\nchildren--all adults. (Items 1, 2) \nApplicant graduated from high school in 1990.

(Items 2, 3, 4) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(a), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based \non the evidence contained in the record. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk that an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. Section 7 of Exec. Or. 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also Exec. Or. 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple \nprerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations  \nAG \u00b6 18 expresses the security concern pertaining to financial considerations: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nAG \u00b6 19 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. AG \u00b6 19(a), an \u201cinability to satisfy debts\u201d and AG \u00b6 19(c), \u201ca history of not \nmeeting financial obligations\u201d apply. Applicant was unable to pay her debts accumulated \nover several years. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nI have considered all of the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 and find the \nfollowing relevant: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; and, \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nConditions beyond Applicant\u2019s control, as previously discussed, contributed to \nher financial problems. For the full application of AG \u00b6 20(b), Applicant must have \nacted responsibly under her circumstances. As previously discussed, Applicant \nprovided documentation of her efforts to resolve her delinquent debts through the FDR \nprogram, which she enrolled in before the SOR. A security clearance adjudication is an \nevaluation of an individual\u2019s judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. It is not a debt-\ncollection procedure. ISCR Case No. 09-02160 (App. Bd. Jun. 21, 2010). The \nadjudicative guidelines do not require that an individual make payments on all \ndelinquent debts simultaneously, pay the debts alleged in the SOR first, or establish \nresolution of every debt alleged in the SOR. He or she need only establish a plan to \nresolve financial problems and take significant actions to implement the plan. See \nISCR Case No. 07-06482 at 2-3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008). I find that AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a) \n20(b), and 20(d) are established. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the \npotentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and \ncircumstances surrounding this case. Overall, the record evidence leaves me without \nquestions or doubts about Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. \nFor all these reasons, I conclude that Applicant has mitigated the financial \nconsiderations security concerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a - 1.l: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant Applicant\u2019s eligibility for \na security clearance.

Early in his testimony, he declared that he \nwas not a drug user and did not know why he should be at the September 2021 security \nclearance hearing. He based the amount he used, which he posted in his e-QIP, on the \nnumber of times he ingested a puff of marijuana from a vape pen, a device that \nproduces vapor from different types of substances, including marijuana. He perceived a \ndifference between smoking the marijuana from a joint or a pipe, as opposed to \ningesting the substance from a pen. (Tr. 23) Applicant noted that he did not inhale \nmarijuana seven to ten times (over the period identified in the SOR). Rather, it was \nseven to ten puffs from a vape pen on two separate occasions, once at a motorcycle \nrace in March 2019 and once at a motorcycle race in September 2019. On both \noccasions, a stranger asked Applicant whether he wanted to inhale a puff from the pen, \nand he acquiesced rather than considering the adverse impact on his security \nclearance. Furthermore, ingesting the drug had no effect on him. (Tr. 22-24, 28, 30) \nDuring the two times Applicant ingested the substance from the pen, he really \ncould not identify the substance (vapor), taking a position at odds with his February \n2021 answer to the SOR. It could have been nicotine or another chemical found in \nmarijuana. Applicant listed marijuana in his December 2019 e-QIP because he wanted \nto be honest and cover himself if he was given a polygraph examination or if the subject \nwas discussed in other subsequent security investigation venues. When he inhaled the \nsubstance in the two circumstances, he was not thinking about his job. In both \nsituations, he had a security clearance. (Tr. 24-26) \nRegardless of the legality of marijuana use from one state to another, Applicant \nknows he should not have used the drug. He is sure that he received security briefings \nor training in the last eight years about marijuana use being against federal law. \nHowever, he suggested there should be more frequent training to remind individuals \nwith security clearances not to engage in any illegal drug use under any circumstances, \nexposing their clearance to immediate jeopardy. (Tr. 26-2, 40) \nApplicant\u2019s resolve not to use marijuana in the future is reinforced by his signed \nstatement of intent to abstain from all drug use in the future, recognizing any future drug \ninvolvement is grounds for revocation of national security clearance eligibility. (AE D) \nApplicant has undergone hair follicle drug testing in January, April, and September \n2021, with consistently negative test results. (Tr. 28-29; AE E, G1, G2) An article \npublished by a well-known drug laboratory explains the benefits of drug testing through \n3 \n\n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nan examination of hair follicles. (AE F) This laboratory administered the tests described \nin AE E, G1, and G2, using this technique. \nThe loss of close friends due to drug use during Applicant\u2019s formative years has \ngalvanized his determination to steer clear of illegal drugs always. He does not \nassociate with drug users. (Tr. 46-47) He has not been to motorcycle races since \nSeptember 2019, and he keeps his motorcycle in the garage. In addition to his work as \na cybersecurity analyst, Applicant has worked in his brother\u2019s landscaping business \nsince 2008. Finally, Applicant\u2019s ongoing compliance with security regulations is critical \nto his continuing obligations of support to his fianc\u00e9 and her daughter. (Tr. 28-29, 41-42) \nAt the present time, Applicant is closely involved in the sporting events of his \nfianc\u00e9\u2019s daughter, his nieces, and his nephews. These events occur on the weekends, \nwhich means that Applicant is attending a softball game or a football game almost every \nweekend. (Tr. 45-46) \nCharacter Evidence \nA character reference recommends Applicant for a security clearance based on \nhis 11-year relationship with Applicant, particularly in 2018 or 2019 when they were \ncoworkers. (C-1) \nA second character reference has known Applicant for 13 years because their \nfamilies lived close to one another at an earlier period in their lives. The reference has \nnever seen Applicant under the influence of drugs. He vouches for Applicant\u2019s security \nclearance eligibility. (C-2) \nThe third character reference (C-3) is a former Judge Advocate General \n(JAG) officer from the United States Air Force (USAF), with extensive experience \nprosecuting drug cases. Reference C-3 has a security clearance. He met Applicant \nthree years ago when Applicant began dating his niece, who is Applicant\u2019s fianc\u00e9. He \ntestified that he was shocked to learn that Applicant used marijuana while holding a \nsecurity clearance. However, based on his interaction with Applicant and his niece over \nthe last three years, C-3 does not believe that Applicant will not resume illegal drug use \nin the future. (Tr. 53-55) \nThe fourth character reference indicated that Applicant\u2019s aberrant display of \npoor judgment is not representative of his stable character. She joins C-3 in \nrecommending Applicant for a security clearance. (C-4) Applicant\u2019s performance \nreviews for 2019 \u201cexceeded expectations.\u201d (B-1, 2) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines, which should be applied \n4 \n\n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nwith common sense and the general factors of the whole-person concept. All available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, \nshould be carefully reviewed before rendering a decision. The protection of the national \nsecurity is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(d) requires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning \npersonnel being considered for national security eligibility will be resolved in favor of the \nnational security.\u201d Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to \nestablish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the \napplicant is responsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, \nextenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d \nThe applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion in seeking a favorable security \ndecision. \nAnalysis \nDrug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nThe security concern under the Drug Involvement/Substance Abuse Guideline \nis set forth in AG \u00b6 24: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual's reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior \nmay lead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. Controlled substance means any \"controlled substance\" \nas defined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term \nadopted in this guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above. \nAG \u00b6 25. Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying include: \n(a) any substance misuse (see above definition); and  \n(c) illegal possession of a controlled substance, including cultivation, \nprocessing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution, or possession \nof drug paraphernalia; and  \n(f) any illegal drug use while granted access to classified information or \nholding a sensitive position. \nApplicant used marijuana once during a motorcycle race in March and once \nduring a race in September 2019. His use of the illegal drug equates to possession of \nthe drug. The display of poor judgment is aggravated by the fact that he used the drug \n5 \n\n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nafter receiving his security clearance in 2013. The three disqualifying conditions above \nhave been established. Applicant\u2019s burden is to submit sufficient evidence in mitigation \nor extenuation. \nAG \u00b6 26. Conditions that could mitigate security concerns include: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast \ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; and \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this \nproblem, and has established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not \nlimited to: \n1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; \nand \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that any \nfuture involvement or misuse is grounds for revocation of national \nsecurity eligibility. \nApplicant\u2019s overall marijuana use was limited to once in March and once in \nSeptember 2019, with his last use occurring more than two years ago. His use was not \ncontinuous throughout the six-month period as alleged in the SOR. He never purchased \nthe drug. He voluntarily reported his September marijuana use on his December 2019 \ne-QIP, and he submitted evidence that he no longer associates with drug users. I am \nconvinced that Applicant fully comprehends that marijuana use continues to be against \nfederal law. The depth of his commitment to abstain in the future is reinforced by his \nsigned statement of intent. All prongs of AG \u00b6\u00b6 26(a) and 26(b) \nWhole-Person Concept \nI \nhave \nexamined \nthe \nevidence \nunder \nthe \nguideline \nfor \ndrug \ninvolvement/substance misuse in the context of the nine general factors of the whole-\nperson concept listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \n6 \n\n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n____________ \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the \nmotivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, \nexploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or \nrecurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for \naccess to classified information must be an overall common-sense judgment based \nupon careful consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. The \nsafeguarding of classified information, together with complying with security regulations \nand the federal law, is an around-the-clock responsibility that does not end when an \napplicant leaves a secured facility at the end of a work day, or when an applicant is on \nvacation. \nApplicant\u2019s illegal use of marijuana stopped in September 2019. Regardless of \nwhether he used marijuana or some other illegal drug on both occasions, he does not \nassociate with persons who do drugs. He no longer attends motorcycle races. He is \nfocused on supporting his future family. He spectates in weekly softball games of his \nwife\u2019s daughter. He regularly watches the sporting events of his nieces and nephews. \nGiven the favorable character references who endorse his security clearance \napplication, and the positive changes in his lifestyle, Applicant\u2019s evidence in mitigation \novercomes the security concerns arising from the drug involvement guideline. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline H: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 1.a: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with the national security interests of the United States to grant \nApplicant eligibility for access to classified information.

(Tr. 66) In December 2019, Applicant paid a debt-\nsettlement company (DSC) a $1,500 retainer because he had difficulty determining which \ncreditor held these four debts. (Tr. 35, 67; AE B) He asked DSC to attempt to reach \nsettlement agreements for these four debts on his behalf. (Tr. 27) In December 2019, \nDSC sent letters to the four creditors indicating he had a significantly reduced income; he \nwas considering filing for bankruptcy; and payment was \u201cinfeasible.\u201d (Tr. 69; AE C) \nApplicant did not review the letters DSC sent to his creditors before they were sent. (Tr. \n76, 77-79) Applicant suggested the language of the letters to the creditors was DSC \nattempting to negotiate a favorable settlement. (Tr. 69) DSC offered to settle the debts \nfor about 10 percent of the amount owed. (Tr. 67; AE C) In December 2019, he was \nconcerned about losing his employment. (Tr. 68) The creditors did not reply to DSC\u2019s \nsettlement offers. (Tr. 28, 30-32) DSC said the debt might be collection barred due to the \nstatute of limitations. (Tr. 30, 32) DSC changed the lawyer who was supposed to \nrepresent Applicant several times. (Tr. 75) Applicant contacted DSC the week before his \nhearing to check the status of the negotiations with his creditors, and DSC advised him \nthat there were no responses. (Tr. 71. 76) DSC recommended that he not contact his \ncreditors because if he \u201cappeared too eager, they would not negotiate very well.\u201d (Tr. 71) \nApplicant did not intend to directly contact the SOR creditors. (Tr. 77) If DSC was \nunable to make progress resolving his debts, he may consider hiring a different lawyer to \nassist him. (Tr. 77) \nOn April 24, 2020, Applicant told an Office of Personnel Management (OPM) \ninvestigator that he hoped to get a payment plan in place for each of his creditors, and he \nhad sufficient income and an inheritance which would enable him to pay his debts. (Tr. \n71; GE 5 at 10) At his hearing, he said he is willing to pay his debts, and he wanted to \nestablish payment plans with his creditors. (Tr. 35) However, he did not want to \nexcessively reduce his reserves. (Tr. 35) He intends to pay his debts. (Tr. 38) He has \nabout $125,000 available from an inheritance available to pay his debts.

(Tr. 25, 57; AE A1) He failed to timely file his federal income tax \nreturns for those four TYs because of fear, uncertainty, procrastination, and laziness. (Tr. \n56) He was concerned about the complication of computing IRS penalties and about the \namount of additional taxes he might owe. (Tr. 56) Applicant used some of the $200,000 \nhe inherited from his mother to pay his $75,000 federal income tax debt in July of 2019. \n(Tr. 25, 58-59; AE A1) He timely filed his federal income tax returns for TYs 2018, 2019, \nand 2020, and he filed his TY 2021 federal income tax return in June 2022. (Tr. 61) He \ndoes not owe any taxes to the IRS. (Tr. 62) His state does not have a state income tax. \nSOR \u00b6 1.b alleges a debt placed for collection for $5,313. Applicant signed a lease \non behalf of his girlfriend and her daughter. His girlfriend and her daughter damaged an \napartment and failed to pay rent.

(Tr. 34; AE E; AE J) \nPolicies \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the Executive \nBranch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security emphasizing, \n\u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. \n518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to control \naccess to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual \nis sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The President \nhas authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicant\u2019s eligibility for \naccess to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \nIndustry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nabout potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Clearance \ndecisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a \ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 7. \nThus, nothing in this decision should be construed to suggest that it is based, in whole or \nin part, on any express or implied determination about applicant\u2019s allegiance, loyalty, or \npatriotism. It is merely an indication the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the \nPresident, Secretary of Defense, and Director of National Intelligence have established \nfor issuing a clearance. \n5 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 at 2 \n(App. Bd. May 2, 1996). \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it \nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d \nISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). The burden of disproving a \nmitigating condition never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 \n(App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if they must, \non the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b).  \nAnalysis \nFinancial Considerations \nAG \u00b6 18 articulates the security concern for financial problems: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds.    \nThe Appeal Board explained the scope and rationale for the financial \nconsiderations security concern in ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012) \n(citation omitted) as follows: \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an applicant might \nknowingly compromise classified information in order to raise money in \nsatisfaction of his or her debts. Rather, it requires a Judge to examine the \ntotality of an applicant\u2019s financial history and circumstances. The Judge \nmust consider pertinent evidence regarding the applicant\u2019s self-control, \njudgment, and other qualities essential to protecting the national secrets as \nwell as the vulnerabilities inherent in the circumstances. The Directive \n6 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \npresumes a nexus between proven conduct under any of the Guidelines \nand an applicant\u2019s security eligibility. \nAG \u00b6 19 includes disqualifying conditions that could raise a security concern and \nmay be disqualifying in this case: \u201c(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the \nability to do so\u201d; \u201c(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations\u201d; and \u201c(f) failure to file \nor fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income tax returns or failure to pay \nannual Federal, state, or local income tax as required.\u201d The record establishes AG \u00b6\u00b6 \n19(b), 19(c), and 19(f). Further discussion of the disqualifying conditions and the \napplicability of mitigating conditions is contained in the mitigation section, infra.  \nThe financial considerations mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are as follows: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control;  \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts;   \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue; \n(f) the affluence resulted from a legal source of income; and \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority \nto file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements.  \nIn ISCR Case No. 10-04641 at 4 (App. Bd. Sept. 24, 2013), the DOHA Appeal \nBoard explained an applicant\u2019s responsibility for proving the applicability of mitigating \nconditions as follows: \n7 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \nOnce a concern arises regarding an applicant\u2019s security clearance eligibility, \nthere is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance of a security \nclearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th Cir. 1990), \ncert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991). After the Government presents evidence \nraising security concerns, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut or \nmitigate those concerns. See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. The standard applicable \nin security clearance decisions is that articulated in Egan, supra. \u201cAny doubt \nconcerning personnel being considered for access to classified information \nwill be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d Directive, Enclosure 2 \u00b6 \n2(b).  \nApplicant indicated a circumstance beyond his control which adversely affected \nhis finances. His girlfriend was addicted to illegal drugs, and she said her drug dealer \nthreatened to kill her unless she paid him. However, \u201c[e]ven if [an applicant\u2019s] financial \ndifficulties initially arose, in whole or in part, due to circumstances outside his [or her] \ncontrol, the [administrative judge] could still consider whether [the applicant] has since \nacted in a reasonable manner when dealing with those financial difficulties.\u201d ISCR Case \nNo. 05-11366 at 4 n.9 (App. Bd. Jan. 12, 2007) (citing ISCR Case No. 03-13096 at 4 \n(App. Bd. Nov. 29, 2005); ISCR Case No. 99-0462 at 4 (App. Bd. May 25, 2000); ISCR \nCase No. 99-0012 at 4 (App. Bd. Dec. 1, 1999)). A component is whether he or she \nmaintained contact with creditors and attempted to negotiate partial payments to keep \ndebts current. Applicant did not provide supporting documentary evidence that he \nmaintained contact with the IRS and the majority of his SOR creditors from 2015 or 2016 \nto 2019. He did not indicate how much he paid his girlfriend. He did not describe \nprecautions he took to ensure he was not providing funds used that she used to purchase \nillegal drugs. \nApplicant failed to timely file his federal income tax returns for TYs 2014 through \n2017 and to timely pay any taxes due. A willful failure to timely make (means complete \nand file with the IRS) a federal income tax return is a misdemeanor-level federal criminal \noffense. Title 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7203, willful failure to file return or supply information, reads: \nAny person . . . required by this title or by regulations made under authority \nthereof to make a return, keep any records, or supply any information, who \nwillfully fails to . . .  make such return, keep such records, or supply such \ninformation, at the time or times required by law or regulations, shall, in \naddition to other penalties provided by law, be guilty of a misdemeanor . . . . \nA willful failure to make return, keep records, or supply information when required, \nis a misdemeanor without regard to the existence of any tax liability. Spies v. United \nStates, 317 U.S. 492 (1943); United States v. Walker, 479 F.2d 407 (9th  Cir. 1973); United \nStates v. McCabe, 416 F.2d 957 (7th  Cir. 1969); O\u2019Brien v. United States, 51 F.2d 193 (7th  \nCir. 1931). For purposes of this decision, I am not weighing Applicant\u2019s failure to timely \nfile his federal income tax returns against him as a crime. In regard to the failure to timely \nfile his federal income tax returns for TYs 2014 through 2017, the DOHA Appeal Board \nhas commented: \n8 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFailure to file tax returns suggests that an applicant has a problem with \ncomplying with well-established governmental rules and systems. Voluntary \ncompliance with such rules and systems is essential for protecting classified \ninformation. ISCR Case No. 01-05340 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 20, 2002). As we \nhave noted in the past, a clearance adjudication is not directed at collecting \ndebts. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 07-08049 at 5 (App. Bd. Jul. 22, 2008). By \nthe same token, neither is it directed toward inducing an applicant to file tax \nreturns. Rather, it is a proceeding aimed at evaluating an applicant\u2019s \njudgment and reliability. Id. A person who fails repeatedly to fulfill his or her \nlegal obligations does not demonstrate the high degree of good judgment \nand reliability required of those granted access to classified information. \nSee, e.g., ISCR Case No. 14-01894 at 5 (App. Bd. Aug. 18, 2015). See \nCafeteria & Restaurant Workers Union Local 473 v. McElroy, 284 F.2d 173, \n183 (D.C. Cir. 1960), aff\u2019d, 367 U.S. 886 (1961). \nISCR Case No. 14-04437 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 15, 2016) (emphasis in original). See ISCR \nCase No. 15-01031 at 4 (App. Bd. June 15, 2016) (citations omitted); ISCR Case No. 14-\n05476 at 5 (App. Bd. Mar. 25, 2016) (citing ISCR Case No. 01-05340 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. \n20, 2002)); ISCR Case No. 14-01894 at 4-5 (App. Bd. Aug. 18, 2015). The Appeal Board \nclarified that even in instances where an \u201c[a]pplicant has purportedly corrected [his or her] \nfederal tax problem, and the fact that [applicant] is now motivated to prevent such \nproblems in the future, does not preclude careful consideration of [a]pplicant\u2019s security \nworthiness in light of [his or her] longstanding prior behavior evidencing irresponsibility\u201d \nincluding a failure to timely file federal income tax returns. See ISCR Case No. 15-01031 \nat 3 & n.3 (App. Bd. June 15, 2016) (characterizing \u201cno harm, no foul\u201d approach to an \napplicant\u2019s course of conduct and employing an \u201call\u2019s well that ends well\u201d analysis as \ninadequate to support approval of access to classified information with focus on timing of \nfiling of tax returns after receipt of the SOR).   \nIn ISCR Case No. 15-01031 (App. Bd. June 15, 2016), the Appeal Board explained \nthat in some situations, even if no taxes are owed when tax returns are not timely filed, \ngrant of access to classified information is inappropriate. In ISCR Case No. 15-1031 (App. \nBd. June 15, 2016) the applicant filed his 2011 federal income tax return in December \n2013, his 2012 federal tax return in September 2014, and his 2013 federal tax return in \nOctober 2015. He received federal tax refunds of at least $1,000 for each year. \nNevertheless, the Appeal Board reversed the administrative judge\u2019s decision to grant \naccess to classified information. \nIn ISCR Case No. 15-06440 at 4 (App. Bd. Dec. 26, 2017) the Appeal Board \nreversed the grant of a security clearance, discussed how AG \u00b6 20(g) applied, and noted: \nThe timing of the resolution of financial problems is an important factor in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s case for mitigation because an applicant who \nbegins to resolve financial problems only after being placed on notice that \nhis clearance was in jeopardy may lack the judgment and self-discipline to \nfollow rules and regulations over time or when there is no immediate threat \nto his own interests. In this case, applicant\u2019s filing of his Federal income tax \n9 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n     \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nreturns for 2009-2014 after submitting his SCA, undergoing his background \ninterview, or receiving the SOR undercuts the weight such remedial action \nmight otherwise merit. \nIn this instance, Applicant filed his overdue federal income tax returns and paid his \nfederal income tax debt before he completed his SCA. SOR \u00b6 1.a is mitigated. He \nestablished a payment plan in 2019 to address the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.b, and this debt is \nmitigated. \nThe debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b ($5,313), 1.d ($13,983), 1.e ($2,714), and 1.f ($8,494) \nbecame delinquent in 2015 and 2016. In December 2019, Applicant retained DSC to \nsettle the debts. After December 2019, he failed to take reasonable and responsible \nactions to ensure DSC acted in good faith in the resolution of the four debts. The letters \nDSC sent to the four creditors about his being unable to pay the debts because of the \nlack of financial resources were misleading. Applicant and DSC waited until after his \nhearing to establish payment plans designed to resolve the four debts in two years. In \nlight of his income and financial resources, his actions are insufficient to mitigate security \nconcerns. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), \u201c[t]he ultimate determination\u201d of whether to grant a security \nclearance \u201cmust be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines\u201d and the whole-person concept. My comments under Guideline F are \nincorporated in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were \naddressed under that guideline but some warrant additional comment. \nApplicant is a 74-year-old electronics engineer, who has worked for the same \ndefense contractor since 1985. He has 37 years of experience as an electronics engineer. \nHe honorably served on active duty in the Army from 1969 to 1971, and in the Army \nReserve from 1971 to 1975. He received a bachelor\u2019s degree in 1972. He has held a \nsecurity clearance for 37 years as a contractor and while he was in the Army. There is no \n10 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nevidence of security violations. His resume provides additional details about his \nprofessional background. \nApplicant\u2019s friend and former coworker, and his two sisters provided statements \nlauding his honesty and good character. His former coworker also emphasized his \nprofessionalism and contributions to his company. Their statements support his continued \naccess to classified information. He received excellent performance evaluations from his \nemployer.  \nThe Appeal Board has addressed a key element in the whole-person analysis in \nfinancial cases stating: \n. . . the concept of meaningful track record necessarily includes evidence of\nactual debt reduction through payment of debts. However, an applicant is \nnot required, as a matter of law, to establish that he has paid off each and \nevery debt listed in the SOR. All that is required is that an applicant \ndemonstrate that he has . . . established a plan to resolve his financial \nproblems and taken significant actions to implement that plan. The Judge \ncan reasonably consider the entirety of an applicant\u2019s financial situation and\nhis actions in evaluating the extent to which that applicant\u2019s plan for the \nreduction of his outstanding indebtedness is credible and realistic. See\nDirective \u00b6 E2.2(a) (Available, reliable information about the person, past \nand present, favorable and unfavorable, should be considered in reaching \na determination.) There is no requirement that a plan provide for payments \non all outstanding debts simultaneously. Rather, a reasonable plan (and \nconcomitant conduct) may provide for the payment of such debts one at a\ntime. Likewise, there is no requirement that the first debts actually paid in \nfurtherance of a reasonable debt plan be the ones listed in the SOR.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \nISCR Case No. 07-06482 at 2-3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008) (internal citations and quotation \nmarks omitted). \nApplicant did not provide a good reason for his procrastination in failing to pay or \nestablish payment plans for several years for the debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b., 1.d, 1.e, and 1.f. \nHis payment plans established in August 2022 to pay the four creditors, in light of his \nfinancial resources, is too little too late to mitigate security concerns. \nIt is well settled that once a concern arises regarding an applicant\u2019s security \nclearance eligibility, there is a strong presumption against granting a security clearance. \nSee Dorfmont, 913 F. 2d at 1401. Applicant\u2019s evidence did not overcome the Dorfmont \npresumption. \nThis decision should not be construed as a determination that Applicant cannot or \nwill not attain the state of reform necessary for award of a security clearance in the future. \nWith more effort towards establishing a track record of timely filing and paying his taxes, \nand a better record of behavior consistent with his obligations, he may well be able to \ndemonstrate persuasive evidence of his security clearance worthiness. \n11 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_________________________ \nI have carefully applied the law, as set forth in Egan, Exec.

(Tr. 39, 43) \nPolicies \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG), which became \neffective on June 8, 2017. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious \nscrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance \ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \n4 \n\n \n \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nFinancial Considerations \nAG \u00b6 18 articulates the security concern for financial problems: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nAG \u00b6 19 provides two disqualifying conditions that could raise a security concern \nand may be disqualifying in this case: \u201c(a) inability to satisfy debts;\u201d and \u201c(c) a history of \nnot meeting financial obligations.\u201d The evidence of record establishes security concerns \nunder AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and 19(c). Further review is necessary. \nAG \u00b6 20 lists five potentially applicable mitigating conditions: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \n5 \n\n \n \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control; \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \nThe Appeal Board concisely explained Applicant\u2019s responsibility for proving the \napplicability of mitigating conditions as follows:  \nOnce a concern arises regarding an Applicant\u2019s security clearance \neligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance \nof a securit\n \ny clearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th \nCir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991). After the Government \npresents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the \napplicant to rebut or mitigate those concerns. See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. The \nstandard applicable in security clearance decisions is that articulated in \nEgan, supra. \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for \naccess to classified information will be resolved in favor of the national \nsecurity.\u201d Directive, Enclosure 2 \u00b6 2(b).  \nISCR Case No. 10-04641 at 4 (App. Bd. Sep. 24, 2013). \nApplicant\u2019s conduct does not warrant full application of AG \u00b6 20(a) because there \nis more than one delinquent debt and his financial problems are not isolated. His debt \nremains a \u201ccontinuing course of conduct\u201d under the Appeal Board\u2019s jurisprudence. See \nISCR Case No. 07-11814 at 3 (App. Bd. Aug. 29, 2008) (citing ISCR Case No. 01-\n03695 (App. Bd. Oct. 16, 2002)). AG \u00b6 20(e) is not applicable. Although Applicant stated \nthe debt is SOR \u00b6 1.f was the result of identity theft, he apparently chose to pay off the \ndebt rather than dispute it. \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 20(b) and 20(d) are fully applicable and 20(c) is partially applicable. \nApplicant\u2019s financial situation deteriorated significantly in approximately 2019 when he \nseparated from his former girlfriend and mother of his second child. His SOR debts in \nlarge part stem from this breakup. In addition to the SOR debts, he is required to pay \n$500 in monthly child support to the mother of his second child in addition to the $500 \nhe is paying to the mother of his first child. As noted supra, Applicant has limited \ndisposable income. That said, he contacted the creditor in SOR \u00b6 1.a (charged-off \n6 \n\n \n \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ndeficiency balance of $11,829 for girlfriend\u2019s truck) and set up a payment plan. Post-\nhearing, he contacted all of his creditors and paid off or settled all of his remaining SOR \ndebts, as well as the two non-SOR debts Department Counsel identified during cross-\nexamination. \nShortly after Applicant began working for his current employer in January 2020, \nhe recognized that his finances were out of control and contacted a credit specialist. \nHowever, he was unable to afford the $100 monthly fee charged by the credit specialist \ngiven his income and expenses. It is unclear from Applicant\u2019s post-hearing documents \nwhether he sold his house to generate the money to pay off his creditors or whether he \nused the $5,000 he had in savings or was able to generate more income by working \novertime. Regardless, he knew that regaining financial responsibility was essential to \nqualify for a security clearance and took reasonable steps to resolve his debts. \nApplicant entered into payment plans for the truck deficiency account in SOR \u00b6 \n1.a as we\n \nll as the non-alleged medical debt Department Counsel identified during cross-\nexamination. Given the financial resources available to the Applicant, it appears that he \ndid his level best to pay off the creditors when he could. The Appeal Board has \nestablished the following basic guidance for adjudications in cases such as this: \nan applicant is not required, as a matter of law, to establish that he has \npaid off each and every debt listed in the SOR. All that is required is that \nan applicant demonstrate that he has established a plan to resolve his \nfinancial problems and taken significant actions to implement that plan. \nThe Judge can reasonably consider the entirety of an applicant\u2019s financial \nsituation and his actions in evaluating the extent to which that applicant\u2019s \nplan for the reduction of his outstanding indebtedness is credible and \nrealistic. There is no requirement that a plan provide for payments on all \noutstanding debts simultaneously. Rather, a reasonable plan (and \nconcomitant conduct) may provide for the payments of such debts one at \na time. \nISCR Case No. 07-06482 at 3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008) (citations 32) and \nquotations omitted). \nWhen considering the entirety of Applicant\u2019s financial situation, I view Applicant\u2019s \ncorrective action to be reasonable. He set up payment plans to pay off two of his larger \ndebts and settled and/or paid his remaining debts. If the pay-off forecasts provided by \nthe two creditors are accurate, Applicant should be debt-free by the time this decision is \npublished. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \n7 \n\n \n \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n     \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \nThe ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security clearance \nmust be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the \nguidelines and the whole-person concept. AG \u00b6 2(c). The discussion in the Analysis \nsection under Guideline F is incorporated in this whole-person section. However, further \ncomments are warranted. \nBoth the mitigating conditions under Guideline F and the whole-person analysis \nsupport a favorable decision. To review, Applicant is a 31-year-old senior composite \nfabricator, who has been employed by a defense contractor since January 2020. At a \nrelatively young age, he found himself responsible for paying $1,000 in monthly child \nsupport for two minor children with two different mothers. He broke up with the mother \nof his second child in 2019, at a time when he could ill afford to take on any additional \ndebt. He accepted responsibility for those debts. I was impressed with his demeanor \nand willingness to go so far as to sell his house to generate the funds to pay off his \ncreditors. It is unclear whether that is what happened, but suffice it to say Applicant \nutilized his post-hearing time to live up to his word to regain financial responsibility. \nThis experience has not been lost on Applicant. He has a job that will provide him \nwith upward mobility and an income level to maintain a reasonable living standard. He \nunderstands what he needs to do to maintain financial responsibility. His efforts at debt \nresolution have established a \u201cmeaningful track record\u201d of debt repayment. \nI take this position based on the law, as set forth in Department of Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518 (1988), my careful consideration of the whole-person factors and \nsupporting evidence, my application of the pertinent factors under the adjudicative \nprocess, and my interpretation of my responsibilities under the adjudicative guidelines. \nFormal Findings \nThe formal findings on the SOR are as follows: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.f: \nFor Applicant \n8 \n\n \n \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nConclusion \nIt is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for \naccess to classified information.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant is 41 years old. He is a high school graduate and has no children. Since February 2020, he has worked for a defense contractor. (Item 4.) Under Guideline F, the SOR alleged that Applicant has eight delinquent debts totaling approximately $245,284. Under Guideline E, the SOR alleged that Applicant deliberately failed to disclose those debts in his security clearance application. (Item 1.) Applicant admitted all allegations in the SOR. (Item 3.)

The SOR debts are currently \ndelinquent. (Item 6.) \nLaw and Policies \nIt is well-established law that no one has a right to a security clearance. As noted \nby the Supreme Court in Department of the Navy v. Egan, \u201cthe clearly consistent standard\nindicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of\ndenials.\u201d Department of Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988) (\u201cit should be obvious\nthat no one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance\u201d); Duane v. Department of Defense, 275\nF.3d 988, 994 (10th  Cir. 2002) (no right to a security clearance).  \n \n \n \n \nUnder Egan, Executive Order 10865, and the Directive, any doubt about whether \nan applicant should be allowed access to classified information will be resolved in favor \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \nof protecting national security. A favorable clearance decision establishes eligibility of an \napplicant to be granted a security clearance for access to confidential, secret, or top-\nsecret information. An unfavorable clearance decision (1) denies any application, (2) \nrevokes any existing security clearance, and (3) prevents access to classified information \nat any level Directive, \u00b6 3.2. \nThere is no presumption in favor of granting, renewing, or continuing eligibility for \naccess to classified information. ISCR Case No. 02-18663 (App. Bd. Mar. 23, 2004). The \nGovernment has the burden of presenting evidence to establish facts alleged in the SOR \nthat have been controverted. An applicant is responsible for presenting evidence to refute, \nexplain, extenuate, or mitigate facts that have been admitted or proven. In addition, an \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision. \nDirective, \u00b6 E3.1.14; Directive, Enclosure 3, \u00b6 E3.1.15. \nIn Egan, the Supreme Court stated that the burden of proof is less than a \npreponderance of evidence. Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.The Appeal Board has followed the \nCourt\u2019s reasoning, and a judge\u2019s findings of fact are reviewed under the substantial-\nevidence standard. ISCR Case No. 01-20700 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002) (citations omitted). \nDiscussion \nGuideline F - Financial Considerations \nUnder Guideline F for financial considerations, the suitability of an applicant may \nbe questioned or put into doubt when that applicant has a history of excessive \nindebtedness or financial problems or difficulties. AG \u00b6\u00b6 18, 19, and 20 (setting forth the \nconcern and the disqualifying and mitigating conditions). \nThe overall concern is: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. AG \u00b6 18. \nThe concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified information to obtain money or something else of value. It \nencompasses concerns about a person\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other important \nqualities. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information. \nIn analyzing the facts of this case, I considered the following disqualifying and \nmitigating conditions or factors: \nAG \u00b6 19(a) inability to satisfy debts; \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 19(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; \nAG \u00b6 20(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not \ncast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \nAG \u00b6 20(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \nThe evidence, including Applicant\u2019s admissions, supports a conclusion that \nApplicant has had a problematic financial history as alleged. Facts admitted by an\napplicant in an answer to a SOR require no further proof by the Government. ISCR Case\nNo. 94-1159 at 4 (App. Bd. Dec. 4, 1995) (\u201cany admissions [applicant] made to the SOR\nallegations . . . relieve Department Counsel of its burden of proof\u201d); ISCR Case No. 94-\n0569 at 4 and n.1 (App. Bd. Mar. 30, 1995) (\u201c[a]n applicant\u2019s admissions, whether\ntestimonial or written, can provide a legal basis for an Administrative Judge\u2019s findings\u201d).\nThe record raises security concerns under disqualifying factors AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and (c).  \n \n \n \n \n \nThe next inquiry is whether any potentially mitigating conditions apply. Applicant\u2019s \ndelinquent debts are numerous and persist to this day. AG \u00b6 20(a) does not apply. \nApplicant alludes to his toxic relationship and divorce as contributing to his financial \nstraits. The Government argues that this contention is too vague to support a mitigating \nfactor in Applicant\u2019s favor. On the one hand, that is a fair point. On the other hand, \nseparations and divorces are fertile grounds for sowing financial hardship between the \nparties. AG \u00b6 20(b) expressly recognizes divorce and separation as factors largely \nbeyond an applicant\u2019s control in financial cases. AG \u00b6 20(b)\u2019s first prong is satisfied. \nThat does not, however, end the inquiry. Faced with adverse circumstances, \nApplicant must show that he acted responsibly to address the financial adversity he \nconfronted. In this case, Applicant wrote letters disputing six of the SOR debts. Those \nletters were written on December 28, 2020, merely a week after the SOR was issued to \nApplicant on December 20, 2020. Applicant\u2019s dispute letters to SOR creditors were \nundoubtedly prompted by his receipt of the SOR. Post-SOR remedial efforts by an \napplicant are often viewed as not being in good faith. The timing of such efforts undercuts \nthe weight of remedial actions. ISCR Case No. 15-06440 at 4 (App. Bd. Dec.8 26, 2017). \nAnd so it is here. AG \u00b6 20(b) does not apply. \nGuideline E - Personal Conduct \nIn assessing an allegation of deliberate falsification, I consider not only the \nallegation and applicant\u2019s answer but all relevant circumstances. AG \u00b6\u00b6 2(d)(1)-(9) and \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n     \n \n \n       \n \n  \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n         \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n2(f)(1)-(6) (explaining the whole person concept). Under Guideline E for personal conduct,\nthe concern is that \u201c[c]onduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, \nor unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions about an \nindividual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability classified or sensitive information.\u201d A\nstatement is false or dishonest when it is made deliberately (knowingly and willfully). An \nomission of relevant and material information is not deliberate if, for example, the person \ngenuinely forgot about it, inadvertently overlooked it, misunderstood the question,\nreasonably did not know the information, or genuinely thought the information did not \nneed to be reported. \n \n \n \nThe record evidence on Applicant\u2019s financial condition and his personal conduct \nraises doubts about Applicant\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, good judgment, and ability to \nprotect classified information. In reaching this conclusion, I weighed the evidence as a \nwhole and considered if the favorable evidence outweighed the unfavorable evidence or \nvice versa. I also gave due consideration to the whole-person concept. Accordingly, I \nconclude that Applicant has not met his ultimate burden of persuasion to show that it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant him eligibility for access to classified \ninformation. \nFormal Findings \nAs required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, I make the following \nformal findings on the SOR allegations: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.f and 1.h: \n Against Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.g: \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline E    \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 2.a.   \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of the record as a whole, it is not clearly consistent with the national \ninterest to grant Applicant access to classified information. \nPhilip J.

They are detailed in the Government\u2019s administrative notice filings (AN I, \nAN II, and AN III) and addressed in the Findings of Fact. \nOfficial pronouncements by the President, the State Department, the Defense \nDepartment, or other appropriate federal agencies on matters of national security are \nlegislative facts for purposes of DOHA adjudications and must govern the judge\u2019s \nanalysis. See ISCR Case No. 17-04208 at 3 (App. Bd.

Nevertheless, the \npleadings in the case concern SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.i, as written and as alleged. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant admitted all of allegations (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.i) without comment. Her \nadmissions are incorporated into the findings of fact. After a thorough and careful review \nof the pleadings and exhibits submitted, I make the following findings of fact. \nApplicant is 42 years old. She was born in the PRC in 1979. She earned her \nundergraduate degree at a university in China in 2001. (Item 4 at 2) She came to the \nUnited States in 2002, at the age of 23, to pursue a graduate education. She earned a \nmaster\u2019s degree in 2004 and a doctorate in 2011, both from a public university in the \nUnited States. She became a naturalized U.S. citizen in 2017. (Item 3 at 7-16) \nApplicant\u2019s husband is a U.S. citizen by birth. They married in 2013 and have a young \ndaughter. (Item 3 at 25, 29) \nApplicant worked as a graduate assistant and adjunct lecturer while pursuing her \ndoctorate. She then worked as a professor at another state university from 2011 to \n2014. From June 2014 to December 2015, she worked as a data scientist for a social \nmedia company. Since January 2016, she has worked as a senior research scientist for \na defense contractor. (Item 3 at 17-22) She has never held a clearance before. (Item 3 \nat 76) \nOn her SCA, Applicant disclosed foreign family members who are citizens and \nresidents of the PRC. She also disclosed various friends who are citizens and residents \nof either the PRC, Hong Kong, or Taiwan. (Item 3) \nApplicant\u2019s parents are citizens and residents of China. They are retired and in \ntheir mid-70s. Her mother worked at a hospital and her father worked for the local \ngovernment in food and drug administration. Applicant has weekly contact with her \nparents. (Item 3 at 28-29) (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b) \nApplicant\u2019s sister is also a citizen and resident of China, along with her sister\u2019s \nhusband (Applicant\u2019s brother-in-law) and their teenage son (Applicant\u2019s nephew). (SOR \n\u00b6\u00b6 1.c, 1.d, 1.e) Her sister works for a bank. Her husband works for a pharmaceutical \ncompany. Applicant has weekly contact with her sister and less frequent contact with \nher nephew and brother-in-law. (Item 3 at 30, 32-35) \nApplicant travelled to China annually from 2011 to 2018. She visited her family \nmembers and friends. (Items 3, 4) There is no record evidence of Applicant\u2019s more \nrecent travel to the PRC, either before (2019) or during the COVID-19 pandemic (2020 \nand later).

(Item 3 at 54-55)  \nSOR \u00b6 1.g, which Applicant admitted, alleges that her \u201cfriends are citizens and \nresidents of Taiwan.\u201d (Items 1, 2) She disclosed two friends in Taiwan on her SCA: \n\uf0b7 J.W. a graduate school friend and roommate who now lives and works in \nTaiwan as a university professor. They maintain occasional contact over \nsocial media (Item 3 at 40-41); and  \n\uf0b7 Y.C., a friend who now lives and works in Taiwan for an insurance company\nThey have quarterly contact. (Item 3 at 44-46)  \n. \nSOR \u00b6 1.h, which Applicant admitted, alleged that she has a friend who is a \ncitizen of China and resident of Hong Kong. This is likely Y.S., a friend of Applicant\u2019s \nfrom graduate school who was born in China and lives in Hong Kong. They maintain \nquarterly contact. (Item 3 at 35-36) \nSOR \u00b6 1.i, which Applicant admitted, alleged that she has a friend who is a \ncitizen and resident of Hong Kong. This may be J.W., a friend who is a citizen of Hong \nKong and New Zealand. He lives in Hong Kong and works for a financial organization. \nThey have quarterly contact. (Item 34 at 50-51) \nApplicant did not provide any additional information in her answer beyond her \nadmissions. She did not respond to the FORM. She offered no additional evidence in \nexplanation or mitigation of the Guideline B security concerns, or under the whole-\nperson concept. \nChina (PRC) \nThe PRC is an authoritarian state in which the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) \nis the paramount authority. China is the world\u2019s most active and persistent perpetrator of \neconomic espionage. China presents a persistent cyber-espionage threat to the United \nStates. China is the most aggressive country conducting espionage against the United \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nStates, and U.S corporations. China has expansive programs in place to acquire U.S. \ntechnology, including sensitive trade secrets and proprietary information to enhance its \nglobal strategic, military, diplomatic, and economic influence. China\u2019s focus is on \nobtaining U.S. information and technologies beneficial to China\u2019s military modernization \nand economic development. China\u2019s intelligence services, as well as private companies \nand entities, frequently seek to exploit Chinese citizens or persons with family ties to \nChina who can use their insider information to access intellectual property and sensitive \ntrade secrets. About 80 percent of all economic espionage prosecutions brought by the \nU.S. Department of Justice allege conduct that would benefit China and at least 60 \npercent of all trade secret theft cases have at least some nexus to China. Recent \ncriminal cases that were prosecuted and involve actual or attempted espionage and \nillegal export of sensitive military technology to China. In addition, China has significant \nhuman rights problems, including the repression of freedom of speech, religion, and \nassociation. (AN I) \nHong Kong \nIn 1997, after centuries in the British Empire, Hong Kong became the Hong \nKong Special Administrative Region of the PRC. Under the PRC\u2019s \u201cone country, two \nsystems\u201d formula, Hong Kong was to enjoy a \u201chigh degree of autonomy in all maters \nexcept foreign and defense affairs for the next 50 years. The people of have traditionally \nenjoyed substantial civil liberties and the rule of law under their local constitution. \nHowever, those freedoms have come under threat in recent years as the Chinese \ngovernment has exerted increased control over the government and people of Hong \nKong. (AN II) \nIn June 2020, the Chinese government announced a sweeping national security \nlaw that brought Hong Kong\u2019s 7.5 million residents under the direct authority of the \nCCP. Since the law\u2019s imposition, the PRC has unilaterally and arbitrarily exercised \npolice and security power in Hong Kong. The PRC has demonstrated an intention to \nuse this authority to target a broad range of activities it defines as acts of secession, \nsubversion, terrorism, and collusion with foreign entities, including participation in \ndemonstrations. The National Security Law also covers offenses committed by non-\nHong Kong residents or organizations outside of Hong Kong, which could subject U.S. \ncitizens who have been publicly critical of the PRC to a heightened risk of arrest, \ndetention, expulsion, or prosecution. (See U.S. State Department Travel Advisory for \nChina: \nhttps://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/traveladvisories/traveladvisories/china-\ntravel-advisory.html (updated January 19, 2022)) \nTaiwan \nTaiwan is a democracy with a democratically elected president and parliament. \nThe PRC is a large economic trading partner.

The U.S. maintains robust cultural, commercial, and other unofficial relations \nwith Taiwan, but the U.S. does not support Taiwanese independence. \nIn recent years, the PRC has adopted a more coercive policy towards Taiwan, \nseeking to isolate and intimidate Taiwan into unification with the PRC on their terms. \nThe PRC has sharply escalated its military, diplomatic, and economic pressure on \nTaiwan. The United States has noted this shift with concern, and has urged the PRC to \nengage in meaningful dialogue with Taiwan\u2019s democratically elected representatives. In \nrecent years, there have been multiple cases involving the illegal export, or attempted \nlegal export, of U.S. restricted, dual use, or military technology to Taiwan, or by \nTaiwanese companies or nationals. (AN III) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe whole-person concept. The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based \non the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk that an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. Section 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin \nterms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty \nof the applicant concerned.\u201d \nAnalysis \nGuideline B, Foreign Influence \nAG \u00b6 6 expresses the security concern regarding foreign influence: \nForeign contacts and interests may be a security concern if the individual \nhas divided loyalties or foreign financial interests, may be manipulated or \ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a \nway that is not in U.S. interests, or is vulnerable to pressure or coercion by \nany foreign interest. Adjudication under this Guideline can and should \nconsider the identity of the foreign country in which the foreign contact or \nfinancial interest is located, including, but not limited to, such \nconsiderations as whether the foreign country is known to target United \nStates citizens to obtain protected information and/or is associated with a \nrisk of terrorism. \nAG \u00b6 7 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. I have considered all of them and the following are potentially applicable: \n(a) contact with a foreign family member, business or professional \nassociate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or resident in a \nforeign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of foreign \nexploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; and \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual\u2019s obligation to \nprotect sensitive information or technology and the individual\u2019s desire to \nhelp a foreign person, group, or country by providing that information. \nAG \u00b6 7(a) requires evidence of a \u201cheightened risk.\u201d The \u201cheightened risk\u201d \nrequired to raise this disqualifying condition is a relatively low standard. \u201cHeightened\nrisk\u201d denotes a risk greater than the normal risk inherent in having a family member\nliving under a foreign government or owning property in a foreign country. The totality of\nApplicant\u2019s family ties to a foreign country as well as each individual family tie must be\nconsidered.  \n \n \n \n \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAs detailed in the administrative notice documents, the PRC is actively and \npersistently engaged in espionage efforts against U.S. strategic, military, diplomatic, \nand economic interests. The PRC uses its intelligence services, as well as private \ncompanies and entities, to exploit Chinese citizens or persons with family ties to China \nto gain information and trade secrets, and the PRC has significant human rights \nproblems. A heightened risk of foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, \nor coercion is established. The same analysis applies for Hong Kong and Taiwan, since \nthey are considered part of the PRC even though Applicant\u2019s connections are limited to \na few friends there. The PRC is also considered a hostile country for purposes of \nGuideline B analysis. An applicant who has relatives in a hostile country has a very \nheavy burden of persuasion as to mitigation. ISCR Case No. 17-04208 at 5 (App. Bd., \nAug. 7, 2019) \nApplicant\u2019s parents are citizens and residents of the PRC, as are her sister, \nbrother-in-law and nephew. She has visited her family in China annually from 2011 to \n2018. Applicant also has friends in PRC, Hong Kong, and Taiwan with whom she \nmaintains contact. These family members and other connections create a heightened \nrisk of foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, and coercion. They also \ncreate a potential conflict of interest. AG \u00b6\u00b6 7(a) and 7(b) have been raised by the \nevidence. \nI have analyzed the facts and considered all of the mitigating conditions under \nAG \u00b6 8 and conclude the following are potentially applicable: \n(a) the nature of the relationship with foreign persons, the country in which \nthese persons are located, or the positions or activities of those persons in \nthat country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be placed in a \nposition of having to choose between the interests of a foreign individual, \ngroup, organization and interests of the U.S.;  \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of \nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, group, government, or country is \nso minimal, or the individual has such deep and longstanding relationships \nand loyalties in the U.S., that the individual can be expected to resolve any \nconflict of interests in favor of the U.S. interests; and \n(c) contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and \ninfrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign \ninfluence or exploitation. \nAG \u00b6 8(c) applies to Applicant\u2019s friends in Hong Kong and Taiwan (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.g, \n1.h, and 1.i). She has no record of visiting Hong Kong or Taiwan, and her contact with \nfriends who now live there is casual and fairly infrequent. Similarly, AG \u00b6 8(c) also \napplies to Applicant\u2019s friends in China (SOR \u00b6 1.f), even though she may see some of \nthem on visits there to see her family. \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant has regular, frequent contact with her parents, sister, brother-in-law, \nand nephew in China, including regular visits there as recently as 2018. Applicant\u2019s \ncontact with her family in China is not infrequent or casual. AG \u00b6 8(c) does not apply to \nthem. \nThe foreign influence concerns are increased because China aggressively and \nactively engages in foreign economic collection and industrial espionage against the \nUnited States. There is insufficient evidence to conclude that the Applicant\u2019s familial \nconnections in China would make it unlikely that she would be placed in a position of \nhaving to choose between his family interests and the interests of the United States. \nApplicant was raised and educated in China but she continued her advanced \neducation in the U.S., has remained here for many years, became a U.S. citizen, and \nshe has married and is raising a family here. She understandably has close ties to her \nfamily in China, has visited them regularly, and maintains close contact. There is \ninsufficient evidence to conclude there is no conflict of interest, either because \nApplicant\u2019s sense of loyalty or obligation to the foreign person, group, government, or \ncountry is so minimal, or because Applicant has such deep and longstanding \nrelationships and loyalties in the U.S., that she can be expected to resolve any conflict \nof interests in favor of the U.S. interests. \nThe nature of a nation\u2019s government and its relationship with the United States is \nrelevant in assessing the likelihood that an applicant\u2019s family members are vulnerable to \ngovernment coercion. The risk of coercion, persuasion, or duress is significantly greater \nif a family member is associated with or dependent upon the foreign government or the \ncountry is known to conduct intelligence operations against the United States. Applicant \ntherefore has a heavy burden to overcome the security concerns established by her \nunderstandably close connections to her family in China. Applicant did not provide \nsufficient information to find that mitigating conditions are applicable. AG \u00b6\u00b6 8(a) and \n8(b) do not apply. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments \nunder Guideline B in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(a) were \naddressed under those guidelines, but some warrant additional comment. \nAs noted, Applicant offered no evidence in mitigation, as she merely admitted \neach SOR allegation without further comment. She also did not answer the FORM, and \ntherefore did not submit any updated evidence about her family connections to China, \nor any other evidence which might have been considered under the whole-person \nconcept. Since she elected a decision on the written record, in lieu of a hearing, I did not \nhave the opportunity to question her about her family circumstances to learn more \ninformation. I also had no opportunity to observe Applicant\u2019s demeanor, and thus, to \nassess her credibility. \nApplicant came to the United States to further her education. She earned a \nmaster\u2019s degree and a doctorate. She has chosen to live and work here, and to marry\nand to raise a family here. She understandably has close, ongoing ties with her family in\nChina. However, I cannot ignore the strong evidence of an ongoing, hostile relationship\nbetween the United States and the PRC, and the Chinese government\u2019s persistent and\nongoing intelligence efforts against the United States and its interests. There is a strong\nheightened risk shown by the Chinese government\u2019s relationship with the United States\nand with the Chinese people through their poor human rights record. Given Applicant\u2019s\nfamily connections to the PRC, I conclude that she did not present sufficient evidence to\nmeet her very heavy burden of persuasion as to mitigation. This is not a commentary on\nher loyalty to the United States. It is merely a conclusion that she did not provide\nsufficient evidence to mitigate foreign influence security concerns under Guideline B.\nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s\neligibility for access to classified information. For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant\nfailed to mitigate the security concerns arising under Guideline B, foreign influence.   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline B:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.e: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.f-1.i:  \nFor Applicant \n10 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security \nclearance.

The action was taken under Executive Order (EO) 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; \nDepartment of Defense (DOD) Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security \nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the \nadjudicative guidelines (AG) effective within the DOD on June 8, 2017. \nOn April 29, 2021, Applicant answered the SOR, and elected to have his case \ndecided on the written record in lieu of a hearing.

The Government\u2019s \nevidence is identified as Items 2 through 9. (Item 1 is the SOR.) Applicant did not provide \na response to the FORM, object to the Government\u2019s evidence, or submit documents. \nItems 2 through 9 are admitted into evidence. The case was assigned to me on November \n4, 2021.1 \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant admitted the three SOR allegations with explanations. After a thorough \nand careful review of the pleadings and exhibits submitted, I make the following findings \nof fact. \nApplicant is 32 years old. He is a high school graduate. He served in the military \nfrom 2009 until he was honorably discharged in December 2014. He attended college \nfrom December 2014 until March 2017. He did not earn a degree. He was employed from \nMarch 2017 until August 2018, then began working with his present employer. Applicant \nmarried in March 2015. In his security clearance application (SCA), completed in June \n2019, he disclosed he and his wife have been separated since November 2016. He \nconfirmed to the government investigator during his background interview in August 2019 \nthat they remain separated and are not divorced. (Items 3, 5) \nIn his SCA, Applicant disclosed that he had a delinquent credit card debt that he \nwas \u201cunable to pay due to divorce, other obligations.\u201d (Item 3) He stated the card became \ndelinquent in May 2018, and he was working on a resolution with an agency. He further \nstated, \u201cno action on repayment, due to recent job and obligations with divorce.\u201d During \nhis background interview he confirmed to the government investigator that the debt in \nSOR \u00b6 1.a ($16,814) that he previously disclosed, was incurred while he was in the \nmilitary. He said he was young and immature and overspent on his credit card. When he \nwas discharged his income was reduced and the account became delinquent. He could \nnot recall how much he owed or information about the account. He said he was working \non a payment plan with the creditor and intended to pay the account. (Item 3, 5) \nThe government investigator confronted Applicant with other delinquent debts, \nincluding those alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b ($8,373) and 1.c ($5,553). Applicant told the \ninvestigator that the credit card debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.b belonged to his wife, and he \nwas only an authorized user. He did not know what type of payment arrangements she \nhad for this account, but he stated if he was liable for the account, he intended to pay it. \nApplicant\u2019s credit reports from July 2019, October 2020, and July 2021, indicate that \nApplicant is the individual account owner for this credit card. (Items 5, 6, 7, 8) \n1 The Government\u2019s Memorandum for the Administrative Judge indicated that Applicant submitted \ninformation, but there was none in the file. I contacted the Department Counsel, who confirmed this was an\nadministrative error and that Applicant did not submit a response to the FORM or additional information.

(Item 5) \nOn March 13, 2020, Applicant received financial interrogatories from the DOD \nConsolidated Adjudications Facility (CAF). On that same day, Applicant contracted with \na debt relief company (DRC) to settle the three debts alleged in the SOR. In response to \nthe interrogatories, Applicant provided payment receipts for debts that were not alleged. \nHe also provided a copy of the debt resolution agreement that reflected that the three \nalleged debts in the SOR were enrolled ($30,720) in it. He is required to make bi-weekly \npayments of $238 for 48 months. (Item 4) (Any derogatory information that was not \nalleged will not be considered for disqualifying purposes, but may be considered when \napplying mitigating conditions and in a whole-person analysis.) \nApplicant\u2019s April 2021 answer to the SOR was a year after he indicated he had an \nagreement with the DRC. In it, he stated for SOR \u00b6 1.a, \u201cI admit, and I also have \ndocuments that support proof of payments.\u201d For SOR \u00b6 1.b he said \u201cI admit, and have \nproof of payment.\u201d For SOR \u00b6 1.c he said, \u201cI admit, and have proof of payment in full.\u201d In \nthe FORM sent to Applicant, the Department Counsel noted that Applicant had yet to \nprovide proof of satisfaction for his delinquent debt. Applicant did not respond to the \nFORM or provide any updated documents to support his statements. (Item 2) \nA review of Applicant\u2019s July 2021 credit report reflects that the balance owed in \nSOR \u00b6 1.a has been reduced by $250 and the balance in SOR \u00b6 1.b has been reduced \nby $200. In addition, this credit report no longer shows the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.c. No \ndocumentary evidence was provided to show this debt was paid, but based on his credit \nreport, I find it is no longer an issue and find for Applicant on this allegation. (Item 8) \nApplicant did not provide information about whether he has received financial \ncounseling. In response to the interrogatories from March 2020, he provided a financial \nstatement that included a list of his income and expenses, which included the payment to \nDRC. His expendable income at the end of each month was $90. His financial statement \ndid not reflect any payments to his estranged wife. He had no savings. (Item 2, 4). \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for national security eligibility, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere \nspeculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 states an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for financial considerations is set out \nin AG & 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling mental \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an individual might knowingly \ncompromise classified information in order to raise money. It encompasses concerns \nabout an individual\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting \nclassified information. An individual who is financially irresponsible may also be \nirresponsible, unconcerned, or negligent in handing and safeguarding classified \ninformation. See ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \nAG \u00b6 19 provides conditions that could raise security concerns. The following are \npotentially applicable: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant had three large debts alleged that are supported by his admissions and \ncredit reports. There is sufficient evidence to support the application of the above \ndisqualifying conditions. \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising \nfrom financial difficulties. The following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially \napplicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; and \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant was aware that he had defaulted on the credit card in SOR \u00b6 1.a. He \nindicated he was only an authorized user on the credit card in SOR \u00b6 1.b, which was \nincorrect. He was the individual account holder. He said he was unaware of the third debt \nalleged in the SOR. In his SCA, he said his financial problems were the result of his \ndivorce. According to his SCA, and Applicant\u2019s statement to the government investigator, \nhe is not divorced, but is separated. His financial statement does not reflect that he is \nproviding his wife support. He did not explain how his separation specifically impacted his \nfinances. Applicant has been employed by his present employer since August 2018. He \nindicated in his SCA that he was working to resolve the credit card debt he disclosed. He \nreiterated this later when he was questioned by the government investigator. It was not \nuntil Applicant received government interrogatories, that he made an agreement with \nDRC. Applicant did not provide an explanation for his failure to address his delinquent \ndebts until after he received the government interrogatories, despite being on notice that \nhis finances were a concern. The timing of resolution of financial problems is an important \nfactor in evaluating an applicant\u2019s case for mitigation because an applicant who takes \naction to resolve financial problems only after being placed on notice his or her clearance \nis in jeopardy may lack the judgment, and self-discipline to follow rules and regulations \nover time or when there is no immediate threat to his or her own interests. See, e.g., ISCR \nCase No. 17-03229 at 4 (App. Bd. Jun. 7, 2019). \nApplicant did not provide a response to the FORM that might shed light on his \nbehavior and did not provide current documents to show that he is in compliance with the \nDRC. There is insufficient evidence that Applicant has participated in financial counseling. \nAt this juncture, I cannot find that financial issues are unlikely to recur and that his \nbehavior does not cast doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, and good \njudgment. AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a) and 20(c) do not apply. \nApplicant\u2019s financial problems may have been somewhat beyond his control, but \nhe failed to provide sufficient evidence to conclude his separation impacted his ability to \npay his debts. He told the government investigator that his failure to pay his credit card \nwas because he was young, immature, and overspent. This was within his control. AG \u00b6 \n20(b) has limited application. \nApplicant\u2019s most recent credit report does not show the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.c. The \nFORM specifically notes that he had not yet provided proof of its satisfaction, highlighting \nApplicant\u2019s responsibility to provide evidence of his actions, if any. It is unknown if the \ndebt was disputed and removed from the credit report, settled, or paid. After considering \nall of the evidence and that this debt was not over seven years old and would not have \nbeen removed from the credit report due to the statute of limitations, I find it is resolved \nand no longer a security concern. \nI conclude that although there is some mitigation, it is insufficient to resolve the \nsecurity concerns in Applicant\u2019s favor. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline F in my whole-person analysis. \nApplicant failed to meet his burden of persuasion. The record evidence leaves me \nwith questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security \nclearance. For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant failed to mitigate the security \nconcerns raised under Guideline F, financial considerations. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.b: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph   1.c:  \nFor Applicant \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national security to grant Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security \nclearance.

(Tr. \n22) \nPolicies \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the Executive \nBranch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security emphasizing, \n\u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. \n518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to control \naccess to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual \nis sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The President \nhas authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicant\u2019s eligibility for \naccess to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \nIndustry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nabout potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Clearance \ndecisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a \ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 7. \nThus, nothing in this decision should be construed to suggest that it is based, in whole or \nin part, on any express or implied determination about applicant\u2019s allegiance, loyalty, or \npatriotism. It is merely an indication the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the \n3 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nPresident, Secretary of Defense, and Director of National Intelligence have established \nfor issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro.

See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 at 2 \n(App. Bd.

Controlled substance means any \u201ccontrolled substance\u201d as \ndefined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term adopted in \nthis guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above. \nDNI Memorandum ES 2014-00674, \u201cAdherence to Federal Laws Prohibiting \nMarijuana Use,\u201d October 25, 2014, states: \n[C]hanges to state laws and the laws of the District of Columbia pertaining \nto marijuana use do not alter the existing National Security Adjudicative \nGuidelines . . . . An individual\u2019s disregard of federal law pertaining to the \nuse, sale, or manufacture of marijuana remains adjudicatively relevant in \n4 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                            \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nnational security determinations. As always, adjudicative authorities are \nexpected to evaluate claimed or developed use of, or involvement with, \nmarijuana using the current adjudicative criteria. The adjudicative authority \nmust determine if the use of, or involvement with, marijuana raises \nquestions about the individual\u2019s judgment, reliability, trustworthiness, and \nwillingness to comply with law, rules, and regulations, including federal \nlaws, when making eligibility decisions of persons proposed for, or \noccupying, sensitive national security positions. \nRecently, the Security Executive Agent (SecEA) promulgated clarifying guidance \nconcerning marijuana-related issues in security clearance adjudications. It states in \npertinent part: \n[Federal] agencies are instructed that prior recreational marijuana use by an \nindividual may be relevant to adjudications but not determinative. The \nSecEA has provided direction in [the adjudicative guidelines] to agencies \nthat requires them to use a \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d This requires \nadjudicators to carefully weigh a number of variables in an individual's life to \ndetermine whether that individual's behavior raises a security concern, if at \nall, and whether that concern has been mitigated such that the individual \nmay now receive a favorable adjudicative determination. Relevant \nmitigations include, but are not limited to, frequency of use and whether the \nindividual can demonstrate that future use is unlikely to recur, including by \nsigning an attestation or other such appropriate mitigation. Additionally, in \nlight of the long-standing federal law and policy prohibiting illegal drug use \nwhile occupying a sensitive position or holding a security clearance, \nagencies are encouraged to advise prospective national security workforce \nemployees that they should refrain from any future marijuana use upon \ninitiation of the national security vetting process, which commences once \nthe individual signs the certification contained in the Standard Form 86 (SF-\n86), Questionnaire for National Security Positions.1 \nAG \u00b6 25 provides two conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying in this case: \u201c(a) any substance misuse (see above definition)\u201d; and \u201c(c) \nillegal possession of a controlled substance. . . .\u201d The record establishes AG \u00b6\u00b6 25(a) and \n25(c). Additional information is contained in the mitigation section, infra. \nAG \u00b6 26 lists four conditions that could mitigate security concerns: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened\nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt\non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n \nSecurity Executive Agent Clarifying Guidance Concerning Marijuana for Agencies Conducting \nAdjudications of Persons Proposed for Eligibility for Access to Classified Information or Eligibility to Hold a \nSensitive Position, dated December 21, 2021 (SecEA Clarifying Guidance), at page 2. \n5 \n1 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and substance \nmisuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and \nhas established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not limited to: \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; and \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that any future \ninvolvement or misuse is grounds for revocation of national security \neligibility; \n(c) abuse of prescription drugs was after a severe or prolonged illness \nduring which these drugs were prescribed, and abuse has since ended; and \n(d) satisfactory completion of a prescribed drug treatment program, \nincluding, but not limited to, rehabilitation and aftercare requirements, \nwithout recurrence of abuse, and a favorable prognosis by a duly qualified \nmedical professional. \nIn ISCR Case No. 10-04641 at 4 (App. Bd. Sept. 24, 2013), the DOHA Appeal \nBoard concisely explained Applicant\u2019s responsibility for proving the applicability of \nmitigating conditions as follows: \nOnce a concern arises regarding an Applicant\u2019s security clearance \neligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance of \na security clearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th \nCir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991). After the Government \npresents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the \napplicant to rebut or mitigate those concerns. See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. The \nstandard applicable in security clearance decisions is that articulated in \nEgan, supra. \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access \nto classified information will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nDirective, Enclosure 2, [App. A] \u00b6 2(b).   \nNone of the mitigating conditions fully apply; however, Applicant provided some \nimportant mitigating information. He voluntarily disclosed his marijuana and cocaine \npossession and use on his SCA, during his OPM interview, in his SOR response, and at \nhis hearing. He has never tested positive for use of illegal drugs. He has never been \narrested for a drug-related offense. He indicated he was willing to abstain from future \nmarijuana and cocaine possession and use. \nThe evidence against mitigation is more persuasive at this time. In ISCR Case No. \n16-03460 at 4 (App. Bd. May 24, 2018), the applicant had a history of marijuana use, and \nthe Appeal Board said: \n6 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \nA clearance adjudication is aimed at determining if an applicant has the \nrequisite judgment and reliability to abide by rules designed to protect \nclassified information. . . . [Security concerns arise if] there is doubt as to \nwhether he [or she] will follow the regulatory requirements for handling \nclassified information, which might, in the event, appear burdensome. \nAccess to national secrets entails a fiduciary duty to the U.S. A person who \nenters into such a fiduciary relationship is charged with abiding by legal and \nregulatory guidance regardless of whether he or she believes that guidance \nto be wise. \nPossession of a Schedule I or II controlled substance is a federal criminal offense. \nSchedules I, II, III, IV, and V, as referred to in the Controlled Substances Act are contained \nin 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 812(c). Marijuana is a Schedule I controlled substance, and cocaine is a \nSchedule II controlled substance. See Drug Enforcement Administration, Drug Scheduling \nlisting at https://www.dea.gov/drug-information/drug-scheduling/. See also Gonzales v. \nRaish, 545 U.S. 1 (2005) (discussing placement of marijuana on Schedule I). \nApplicant possessed and used marijuana and cocaine even though he was aware \nthat his defense contractor employer had a rule prohibiting involvement with illegal drugs. \nHe knew possession of marijuana and cocaine were illegal. An applicant who uses illegal \ndrugs after having been placed on notice of its employment or security significance \u201cmay \nbe lacking in the qualities expected of those with access to national secrets.\u201d See \ngenerally ISCR Case No. 17-03191 at 3 (App. Bd. Mar. 26, 2019) (citing ISCR Case No. \n17-04198 at 2 (App. Bd. Jan. 15, 2019) (\u201cAn applicant\u2019s misuse of drugs after having been \nplaced on notice of the incompatibility of drug abuse with clearance eligibility raises \nquestions about his or her judgment and reliability\u201d)). Applicant has family and friends \nwho use marijuana, and it is likely that he will be in the vicinity of marijuana in the future. \nApplicant used cocaine once in December 2015 and once in April 2019. His \ncocaine use is not recent. He used marijuana from August 2008, to about June 2020. His \nmarijuana use is recent. More time without marijuana use must elapse before I will be \nable to confidently rule out future marijuana use. Guideline H security concerns are not \nmitigated at this time. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n7 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), \u201c[t]he ultimate determination\u201d of whether to grant a security \nclearance \u201cmust be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines\u201d and the whole-person concept. My comments under Guideline H are \nincorporated in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were \naddressed under that guideline but some warrant additional comment. \nApplicant is a 32-year-old manufacturing engineer. In 2012, he was awarded a \nbachelor\u2019s degree in mechanical engineering. In 2018, he married, and he has a four-\nmonth-old son. He has worked for a defense contractor for five years. He has never held \na security clearance. \nApplicant disclosed his marijuana and cocaine possession and use on his SCA, \nduring his OPM interview, on his SOR response, and at his hearing. An honest and candid \nself-report of drug abuse is an important indication that, if granted security clearance \neligibility, the individual would disclose any threats to national security, even if the \ndisclosure involves an issue that might damage his or her own career or personal \nreputation. However, the mitigating weight of Applicant\u2019s disclosures is undermined by \nhis marijuana and cocaine possession and use after going to work for a defense \ncontractor with a policy against illegal drug use. His marijuana use as recently as June \n2020 is too recent to be fully mitigated at this time. \nIt is well settled that once a concern arises regarding an applicant\u2019s security \nclearance eligibility, there is a strong presumption against granting a security clearance. \nSee Dorfmont, 913 F. 2d at 1401. \u201c[A] favorable clearance decision means that the record \ndiscloses no basis for doubt about an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified \ninformation.\u201d ISCR Case No. 18-02085 at 7 (App. Bd. Jan. 3, 2020) (citing ISCR Case \nNo. 12-00270 at 3 (App. Bd. Jan. 17, 2014)). \nI have carefully applied the law, as set forth in Egan, Exec. Or. 10865, the Directive, \nthe AGs, and the Appeal Board\u2019s jurisprudence to the facts and circumstances in the \ncontext of the whole person. Applicant failed to mitigate drug involvement and substance \nmisuse security concerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline H:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 1.a: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.b: \nFor Applicant \n8 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n______________________ \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant Applicant\u2019s eligibility for \naccess to classified information.

The case was assigned to me on \nOctober 6, 2021. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant is 35 years old. He is married and has one child (four years old). \nApplicant has a bachelor\u2019s degree. Since September 2017, he has been employed by a \ndefense contractor. (Item 3.) \nThe SOR alleged that Applicant: (1) purchased and used marijuana with varying \nfrequency from about January 2017 until February 2020; and (2) intends to continue using \nmarijuana in the future. (Item 1.) Applicant admitted the SOR allegations. (Item 2.) He \nlater qualified those admissions. In his Personal Subject Interview (PSI), Applicant said \nthat marijuana purchase and use is legal in his state\u2019s law. He purchases the drug legally \nat a \u201crecreational dispensary.\u201d Applicant said, \u201che will stop using and purchasing \nmarijuana if he is granted a Federal security clearance.\u201d Applicant was aware that \npurchase and use of marijuana is illegal under Federal law. (Item 4.) \nDiscussion \nGuideline H \u2013 Drug Involvement and Substance Abuse \n \nUnder AG H for drug use, suitability of an applicant may be questioned or put into \ndoubt because drug use can both impair judgment and raise questions about a person\u2019s \nability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations. AG \u00b6\u00b6 24, 25 and 26 \n(setting forth the concern and the disqualifying and mitigating conditions). \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of prescription \nand non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances that cause \nphysical or mental impairment or are used in a manner inconsistent with their \nintended purpose can raise questions about an individual's reliability and \ntrustworthiness, both because such behavior may lead to physical or \npsychological impairment and because it raises questions about a person's \nability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations. Controlled \nsubstance means any \"controlled substance\" as defined in 21 U.S.C. 802. \nSubstance misuse is the generic term adopted in this guideline to describe any \nof the behaviors listed above. \nIn analyzing the facts of this case, I considered the following disqualifying and \nmitigating conditions or factors: \nAG \u00b6 25(a) any substance misuse (see above definition); \nAG \u00b6 25(c) illegal possession of a controlled substance; \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n  AG \u00b6 25(g)\n \n \n \n \n \n     \n \n \n \n expressed intent to continue drug involvement . . . or failure to \nclearly and convincingly commit to discontinue such misuse; \nAG \u00b6 26(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or         \nhappened under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not \ncast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \nApplicant admitted to legally purchasing and using marijuana from January 2017 \nto February 2020. Applicant also admitted that he will continue to use marijuana, unless \nhe is granted a security clearance. Facts admitted by an applicant in an answer to an \nSOR or in an interview require no further proof from the Government. ISCR Case No. 94-\n1159 at 4 (App. Bd. Dec. 4, 1995) (\u201cany admissions [applicant] made to the SOR \nallegations . . . relieve Department Counsel of its burden of proof\u201d); ISCR Case No. 94-\n0569 at 4 and n.1 (App. Bd.

In an October 25, 2014 \nmemorandum, the Director of National Intelligence affirmed that the use of marijuana is \na security concern. James R. Clapper, Director of National Intelligence, Memorandum: \nAdherence to Federal Laws Prohibiting Marijuana Use (October 25, 2014). See also \nhttp://www.dea.gov/druginfo/ds.shtml. \nMore recently, on December 21, 2021, the Director of National Intelligence signed \nthe memorandum, Security Executive Agent Clarifying Guidance Concerning Marijuana \nfor Agencies Conducting Adjudications of Persons Proposed for Eligibility for Access to \nClassified Information or Eligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position. It emphasizes that federal \nlaw remains unchanged with respect to the illegal use, possession, production, and \ndistribution of marijuana. Individuals who hold a clearance or occupy a sensitive position \nare prohibited by law from using controlled substances. Disregard of federal law \npertaining to marijuana (including prior recreational marijuana use) remains relevant, but \nnot determinative, to adjudications of eligibility. Agencies are required to use the \u201cwhole-\nperson concept\u201d stated under SEAD 4, to determine whether the applicant\u2019s behavior \nraises a security concern that has not been mitigated. \nApplicant\u2019s past use of marijuana and his conditional intent to use it in the future if \na clearance is not granted make disqualifying conditions AG \u00b6\u00b6 25(a), (c), and (g), apply \nhere. The next inquiry is whether any mitigating factors apply. \nI have considered disqualifying factor AG \u00b6 25(g) in light of Applicant\u2019s admission \nthat he would cease using marijuana if he were granted a security clearance. Adjudicative \nGuideline H does not recognize, expressly or impliedly, a mitigating factor under these \ncircumstances. Nor does the \u201cwhole person concept\u201d offer any guidance that would \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n             \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nmitigate Applicant\u2019s past and potentially future use of marijuana if a clearance is not \ngranted. The Government\u2019s grant or denial of a clearance is not a bargaining chip that \ncan be negotiated away by an applicant\u2019s promise to cease illegal drug usage in the future \nI have considered mitigating factor AG \u00b6 26(a). Applicant used illegal drugs on \nvarying occasions from January 2017 to February 2020. His behavior was not infrequent, \nnor was it long ago. I find that AG \u00b6 26(a) does not apply. \nThe record raises doubts about Applicant\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, judgment, and \nability to protect classified information. In reaching this conclusion, I weighed the evidence \nas a whole and considered if the favorable evidence outweighed the unfavorable \nevidence or vice versa. I also gave due consideration to the whole-person concept. AG \n\u00b6\u00b6 2(d)(1)-(9) and 2(f)(1)-(6). Accordingly, I conclude that Applicant has not met his \nultimate burden of persuasion to show that it is clearly consistent with the national interest \nto grant him eligibility for access to classified information. \nFormal Findings \nAs required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, I make the following \nformal findings on the SOR allegations: \nParagraph 1, Guideline H: \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.c: \n   Against Applicant  \n      Against Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of the record as a whole, it is not clearly consistent with the national interest \nto grant Applicant access to classified information.

Applicant registered in June of 2017, and re-registered in April of 2020 due to \nan \u201cAddress Change.\u201d (Answer at pages 3~9.) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines (AG) list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. The entire \nprocess is a conscientious scrutiny of applicable guidelines in the context of a number of \nvariables known as the whole-person concept. The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires, \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. I have not drawn inferences based on mere speculation or \nconjecture. \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.14 requires the Government to present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 states, \u201cThe applicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants national \nsecurity eligibility. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the \napplicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as \nto potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified or sensitive information. \nFinally, as emphasized in Section 7 of EO 10865, \u201cAny determination under this order \nadverse to an applicant shall be a determination in terms of the national interest and shall \nin no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See also EO \n12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access to classified or sensitive \ninformation.) \nAnalysis \nGuideline J: Criminal Conduct \nAG \u00b6 30 sets forth the security concerns pertaining to criminal conduct: \nCriminal activity creates doubt about a person's judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person's ability or \nwillingness to comply with laws, rules and regulations. \nAG \u00b6 31 describes two conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying in this case: \n(a) a pattern of minor offenses, any one of which on its own would be\nunlikely to affect a national security eligibility decision, but which in \ncombination cast doubt on the individual\u2019s judgment, reliability, or \ntrustworthiness; and \n \n(b) evidence (including, but not limited to, a credible allegation, an \nadmission, and matters of official record) of criminal conduct, regardless of \nwhether the person was formally charged, formally prosecuted or convicted. \nApplicant was convicted of indecent exposure in June of 2017, for a misdemeanor \noffense that occurred about July of 2016. The evidence establishes the above two \ndisqualifying conditions. \nAG \u00b6 32 provides two conditions that could mitigate the above security concerns \nraised in this case: \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; and \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including but not limited to \nthe passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, restitution, \ncompliance with the terms of parole or probation, job training or higher \neducation, \ngood \nemployment \nrecord, \nor \nconstructive \ncommunity \ninvolvement. \nSufficient time has passed since Applicant\u2019s misdemeanor behavior, which \noccurred more than six years ago. The evidence does establish mitigation under each of \nthe above conditions. Criminal Conduct is found for Applicant. \nGuideline D: Sexual Behavior \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Sexual Behavior is set out in AG \n\u00b6 12: \nSexual behavior that involves a criminal offense; reflects a lack of judgment \nor discretion; or may subject the individual to undue influence of coercion, \nexploitation, or duress. These issues, together or individually, may raise \nquestions about an individual's judgment, reliability, trustworthiness, and \nability to protect classified or sensitive information. Sexual behavior \nincludes conduct occurring in person or via audio, visual, electronic, or \nwritten transmission. No adverse inference concerning the standards in this \nGuideline may be raised solely on the basis of the sexual orientation of the \nindividual. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 13. Three are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) sexual behavior of a criminal nature, whether or not the individual has \nbeen prosecuted; \n(c) sexual behavior that causes an individual to be vulnerable to coercion, \nexploitation, or duress; and \n(d) sexual behavior of a public nature or that reflects lack of discretion or \njudgment. \nApplicant indecently exposed himself in 2016. The evidence is sufficient to raise \nthese disqualifying conditions. \nAG \u00b6 14 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. I considered \nall of the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 14 including: \n(a) the behavior occurred prior to or during adolescence and there is no \nevidence of subsequent conduct of a similar nature; \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(b) the sexual behavior happened so long ago, so infrequently, or under \nsuch unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or judgment; and \n(c) the behavior no longer serves as a basis for coercion, exploitation, or \nduress. \nApplicant\u2019s conduct occurred when he was 20 years old, more than six years ago, \nand there has been no reoccurrence of such misconduct. He is registered as a sex \noffender; and as such, is not susceptible to coercion, exploitation, or duress, as his sexual \noffense is of public record. Sexual Behavior is found for Applicant. \nGuideline E: Personal Conduct \nThe concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 15: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. \nBased on Applicant\u2019s sexual misconduct, the following disqualifying condition \napplies under AG \u00b6 16: \n(e) personal conduct, or concealment of information about one\u2019s conduct \nthat creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress by a \nforeign intelligence entity or other individual or group.

After weighing the disqualifying \nand mitigating conditions under Guidelines J, D and E, and evaluating all the evidence in \nthe context of the whole person, I conclude that Applicant mitigated the security concerns \nraised by his 2016 indecent exposure. Accordingly, Applicant has carried his burden of \nshowing that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant him eligibility for \naccess to classified information. \nFormal Findings \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \nParagraph 1 Guideline J (Criminal Conduct):  FOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 1.a: \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 2 Guideline D (Sexual Behavior): \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 2.a: \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 3 Guideline E (Personal Conduct): FOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 3.a. and b:  \nFor Applicant \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nConclusion \nI conclude that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.

In his answer, \nApplicant admits the allegations with explanations. \n(Applicant\u2019s Answer to SOR.) \nCredit reports of the Applicant dated November 25, 2017; April 11, 2019; April 14, 2020; \nand May 17, 2021, confirm this indebtedness. (Government Exhibits 2, 3, 4, and 5.) \nApplicant began working in the defense industry in 1997, and was hired on with \nhis current employer in 2007. He earns about $200,000 annually. Applicant\u2019s wife also \nworks outside of the home. She earns about $20,000 annually. Applicant explained \nthat his wife has always handled paying the bills, and keeping track of the household \nfinances. Applicant explained that his youngest child was born two months premature. \nAt that time, things were very hectic. He lost track of the bills, and things fell behind. \nApplicant stated that at some point a collection agency contacted him looking for \npayment. Applicant testified that he set up a payment arrangement with the collection \nagency, automatic monthly payments to be deducted out of Applicant\u2019s bank account to \ncover his debts. Applicant cannot recall which creditor or creditors he paid.  He believes \nthe debt to be about $20,000 that he paid through automatic payments over the course \nof three years. Applicant stated that he felt as though he was addressing his past due \nindebtedness. (Tr. p. 20.) He has no documentation to substantiate this testimony. \nApplicant stated that he forgot to report his delinquent debt to his security officer due to \nthe many distractions. (Tr. p. 21.)

(Tr. p. 34.) The \nfollowing delinquent debts are of security concern: \n1.a.  A delinquent debt owed to a creditor was placed for collection in the amount \nof $557.  Applicant had no documentation to show whether he has paid the debt. \nFollowing the hearing, Applicant\u2019s submitted a receipt dated June 27, 2022, for payment \nof the debt in the amount of $1,032.74, which includes the debt of $557, plus interest \nand convenience fees.  (Applicant\u2019s Post-Hearing Exhibit B.)  The debt is no longer \nowing.        \n1.b. \nA delinquent debt owed to a bank was charged-off in the amount of \n$38,255. Applicant believes it was a credit card or line of credit. Applicant \nacknowledged that the account was last paid in May 2013.  Applicant did not know the \nstatus of this debt.  (Tr. p. 25.)  Following the hearing, Applicant indicated that he \ncontacted the creditor and set up a payment arrangement that he plans to follow.  There \nis no documentation to support this claim.  (Applicant\u2019s Post-Hearing Exhibit F.)  The \ndebt remains owing.     \n1.c.  A delinquent debt owed to a creditor was charged-off in the amount of $393.  \nApplicant believes this was a credit card.  Applicant believes that the debt was last paid \nin August 2011. Applicant did not know the status of the account.  (Tr. p. 27.)  Following \nthe hearing, Applicant submitted a receipt from the creditor showing that the account \nwas paid in full on November 30, 2015.  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit D.)

Following the hearing, Applicant stated that he tried to contact the creditor \nbut was unable to reach the company for information.  Applicant contends that the \naccount is closed, and is not listed on his most recent credit report dated June 28, 2022, \nfrom Equifax.  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit C.)  The debt is no longer owing. \n1.e. A delinquent debt owed to a creditor was placed for collection in the amount \nof $57.  Applicant believes this to be part of his son\u2019s neonatal intensive care unit \n(NICU) expenses.

The \ndebt is no longer owing. \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. The entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of \nvariables known as the whole-person concept. The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance \ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to \npotential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAnalysis \nGuideline F -  Financial Considerations \nThe security concern for Financial Considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. Three are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) Inability to satisfy debts; \n(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nIt is difficult to determine whether Applicant incurred excessive delinquent debt \nthat he could not afford to pay, or whether he simply ignored his debt for many years \nand focused on other priorities. In either case, his actions or inactions both \ndemonstrated a history of not addressing his responsibility to pay his delinquent debt. \nThe evidence is sufficient to raise the above disqualifying conditions. \nThe following mitigating conditions under the Financial Considerations guideline \nare potentially applicable under AG \u00b6 20. \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment;   \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely\nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g. loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \n \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n       \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control;  \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis or provides evidence of \nactions to resolve the issue. \nAt the hearing, Applicant knew very little about his financial indebtedness. He \nprovided no documentation to show that he had set up payment arrangements, made \npayments, or had any contact with his creditors. \nIn fact, there was nothing that \nApplicant had done to resolve the delinquent debts set forth in the SOR. Following the \nhearing, Applicant made some effort to obtain some information concerning the debts. \nHe has paid off two of the smaller debts and two others are no longer reflected as owing \non his most recent credit report. However, the largest and most concerning of the debts \nremains owing, in the amount of $38,255, Applicant claims that he has now contacted \nthe creditor and set up a payment plan. However, there is no documentation to support \nhis claim. \nApplicant has been financially irresponsible for many years. Even though life \nbrings obstacles, one must continue to be responsible to pay one\u2019s bills in a timely \nfashion. Applicant contends that this hectic period in his life occurred shortly after his \nyoungest child was born, who is now 9 years old. Applicant has had sufficient time \nsince then to resolve his delinquent debts. The fact that he waited until after the hearing \nto do anything about his financial issues are of great concern to the Government and \nshows unreliability, untrustworthiness, and poor judgment. \nEven if Applicant has \nrecently set up a payment plan to pay his debt for $38,255, he owes a significant \namount of money to the creditor for a debt he incurred years ago. \nUnder the \ncircumstances, Applicant has not demonstrated that he is sufficiently responsible to \naccess classified information. Mitigating Conditions 20(a), 20(b), 2(c), 20(d), and 2(e), \ndo not show full mitigation. \nThere is insufficient evidence in the record to show that the Applicant has carried \nhis burden of proof to establish mitigation of the government security concerns under \nGuideline F. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n     \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nrelevant facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I conclude Applicant has not \nmitigated the Financial Considerations security concern. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 1.a. \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.b.  \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.c. through 1.e. \nFor Applicant \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for \na security clearance.

He married in June 2011 and divorced in September 2014, and they had no children together. He remarried in June 2021, and she is the mother of his daughter. He received a high school diploma in 2010.

National security eligibility for access to classified information is \ndenied. \nHistory of the Case \nApplicant submitted a security clearance application (SCA) on August 8, 2019. On \nDecember 11, 2020, the Defense Counterintelligence and Security Agency (DCSA) \nissued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) alleging security concerns under Guideline F \n(financial considerations). Applicant answered the SOR on August 21, 2021, and elected \nto have a hearing. (Answer) The case was assigned to me on June 8, 2022. On July 18, \n2022, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) notified Applicant that the \nhearing was scheduled for August 2, 2022. \nI convened the hearing as scheduled via video teleconference on Microsoft Teams. \nI marked the July 18, 2022 case management order as Hearing Exhibit (HE) I; Department \nCounsel\u2019s exhibit list as HE II; and Department Counsel\u2019s June 1, 2022 discovery letter \nas HE III. Department Counsel submitted eight exhibits, which I marked as Government \nExhibits (GE) 1 through 8. GE 1 and 8 were admitted without objection. I admitted GE 2 \nto 4 (May 2022, October 2020, and September 2019 credit reports, respectively), over \nApplicant\u2019s objection to them being outdated.

His objections go \nto the weight rather than the admissibility of GE 2 to 8. Applicant testified and did not \nsubmit any exhibits. DOHA received the transcript (Tr.) on August 12, 2022. \nAt the hearing, per Applicant\u2019s request, I held the record open until August 23, \n2022, to allow him to submit documentation, including, but not limited to an updated credit \nreport and other documentation to reflect the resolution of the debts alleged in the SOR. \nOn August 19, 2022, he sent an email requesting an extension to September 2, 2022. \nDepartment Counsel did not object, and I granted his request. I marked the exchange of \nemails as HE IV. He did not submit documentation, and the record closed on September \n2, 2022. \nAmendment to the SOR \nDuring the hearing, Department Counsel questioned Applicant regarding \nunalleged debts that she learned of based upon the DISS reports found in GE 5 and 6 \nand court records found in GE 7. She moved to amend the SOR, pursuant to Paragraph \n17 of the Additional Procedure Guidance of the Directive, to add the following allegations: \nSOR \u00b6 1.m. Your wages at your employer are being garnished by Creditor\nA in the approximate amount of $1,754. As of the date of this hearing, the\namount remains unpaid. \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.n. Your wages at your employer are being garnished by Creditor \nB in the approximate amount of $14,712. As of the date of this hearing, the \namount remains unpaid. \nSOR \u00b6 1.o. You are indebted to the Commonwealth for past-due fines and \ncourt costs in the approximate amount of $126. As of the date of this \nhearing, the amount remains unpaid. \nSOR \u00b6 1.p. You are indebted to the Commonwealth for past due fines and \ncourt costs in the approximate amount of $101. As of the date of this \nhearing, the amount remains unpaid. \nI denied Department Counsel\u2019s motion to amend SOR \u00b6 1.m to allege the amount \nof $1,869. This larger amount did not conform to the documentary evidence and did not \nreflect the balance of the debt Applicant owed at the time of the hearing. Additionally, I \ndenied her motion to amend the SOR to include a $4,482 garnishment, as the \nGovernment admitted that this debt was duplicative of the debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.c. (Tr. \n25-29, 81-89) \nApplicant objected to the motion to amend the SOR to add the additional \nallegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.m through 1.p. He argued that he had resolved the debts in SOR \n\u00b6\u00b6 1.m, 1.o, and 1.p prior to the hearing and was making payments toward the debt in \nSOR \u00b6 1.n. Additionally, he indicated Department Counsel should have amended the \nSOR prior to the hearing date.

I left the record open until August 23, 2022, and granted Applicant \nan extension to September 2, 2022, to provide him an opportunity to submit documentary \nevidence to corroborate his testimony and rebut the SOR allegations. See ISCR 02-23365 \nat 5 (App. Bd. Mar. 22, 2004) (\u201c[A]s long as there is fair notice to an applicant about the \nmatters that are at issue in his case, and the applicant has a reasonable opportunity to \nrespond, a security clearance case should be adjudicated on the merits of the relevant \nissues and should not be overly concerned with pleading niceties.\u201d); See also ISCR Case \nNo. 05-05334 at 4 (App. Bd. Jan. 10, 2007) (\u201cThe government and the Judge are free to \namend the SOR at any time, but must permit Applicant time and an opportunity to respond \nto the adverse reason upon which any adverse decision is based.\u201d). Applicant did not \nsubmit any post-hearing documentation. (Tr. 25-29, 81-89) \nUpon sua sponte reconsideration, I am denying Department Counsel\u2019s request to \namend the SOR. Applicant timely objected to the amendment, and he should have had \n15 days of notice of all SOR allegations, which would have given him more of an \nopportunity to decide whether to present evidence at the hearing to corroborate his claims \nof efforts to resolve the unalleged delinquent debts. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant is 30 years old and has a two-year-old daughter and sons who are five \nand seven years old. He married in June 2011 and divorced in September 2014, and they \nhad no children together. He remarried in June 2021, and she is the mother of his \ndaughter. He received a high school diploma in 2010. He is currently taking college \ncourses toward a degree in business and leadership, and has completed approximately \n84 college credits. He enlisted in the U.S. Navy in October 2010, and served on active \nduty until June 2018, when he was honorably discharged as an Aviation Machinist\u2019s mate \nsecond-class petty officer (AM2). He has worked for his employer, a DoD contractor, \nsince November 2018. After at least two promotions, he is now a custom facilities \nspecialist. He has held a secret security clearance since 2010. (Tr. 10-11, 30-40) \nThe SOR originally alleged that Applicant has twelve delinquent debts totaling \n$37,721. In his response, he indicated, \u201cI admit\u201d to each of the SOR allegations, but \nclaimed that all of the debts were \u201csettled and paid.\u201d Therefore, I am considering his \nanswers to be de facto denials. He did not submit supporting documentation to support \nhis claims. (SOR, Answer, GE 5-7) \nIn Applicant\u2019s August 2019 SCA, he disclosed two delinquent debts, one of which \nwas alleged in SOR as \u00b6 1.j. He claimed he had resolved the unalleged debt and was \nmaking payments toward the delinquent debt alleged as SOR \u00b6 1.j. (GE 1 at 41-43) \nIn September 2019, Applicant was interviewed by a government investigator. His \noverall finances were discussed as well as all of the debts alleged in the SOR. He \nindicated his ex-wife incurred several debts in his name without his knowledge and \nauthorization, during a deployment while serving in the Navy. He did not become aware \nof the debts until he returned from the deployment.

He did not find out about this \nissue until he returned from his deployment. (GE 8) \nApplicant told the investigator that all of the delinquent debts were resolved \nthrough payment arrangements. The investigator contacted Applicant multiple times and \neither spoke to him or left voice messages for him between September 14, 2019, and \nMarch 5, 2020. These contacts were regarding Applicant\u2019s finances and Applicant \nproviding documentation to support his claims that he had resolved or was resolving his \ndelinquent debts. He failed to provide documentation to the investigator. (GE 8) \nThe $4,143 credit-card debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.a remains unresolved despite \nApplicant\u2019s assertion that he settled it. This account was opened in January 2017. He \ntestified that it was opened to assist in the purchase of his motorcycle; however, as noted \nbelow, the loan for his motorcycle was opened in 2014. Regardless, his last payment \ntoward this account was made in approximately January 2019, and the debt was \nultimately charged off.

(Answer; GE 4 at 6; GE 8; Tr. 57) \nThe $7,930 auto-related debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.c was resolved in March 2022 \nthrough garnishment. Applicant testified that two months after he purchased the vehicle \nin August 2015, it stopped working. Because he had a 90-day warranty, he ultimately, \nreturned it to the dealership; however, the creditor garnished his wages. He resumed \nmaking voluntary payments, at an unrecalled date, and paid the remaining balance prior \nto purchasing his home in March 2022. The documentary evidence reflects that Applicant \nstopped making voluntary payments in May 2016, and the last garnishment was on March \n15, 2022. He could not recall how much he paid to resolve this debt, but indicated he \nwould submit paperwork after the hearing with the relevant information. He did not submit \ndocumentation.

According to Applicant, both of \nthese debts were due to overpayments by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). He \ntestified that they were resolved in December 2021, after he requested the VA apply his \ndisability benefits to the debts. He was required to pay them before he could purchase \nhis home using his VA eligibility in March 2022.

Sometime between 2015 and 2018, he lived at an apartment managed by X \nProperty Management.

While living there, he was late a few times with his rent. During this time, \nhe was first trying to \u201ctake care of a lot of the debts that [he] had acquired from [his] \nmarriage.\u201d He lived in the apartment with the mother of his oldest son. After he moved \nout, at an unrecalled date, X Property Management replaced the carpet due to damage \ncaused by Applicant. His deposit was seized, and the balance of the cost of the carpet \nwas also charged to Applicant. The garnishment balance decreased from $1,869 in June \n2021 to $1,754 in February 2022; therefore, there is some evidence of Applicant making \npayments toward this debt, as the balance has reduced over time. However, he failed to \nproduce documentation that he resolved it in March 2022, as he asserted. (GE 5-6; Tr.\n61-67, 82-83, 85-87) \n \n \nThe unalleged $14,712 writ of garnishment remains unresolved despite Applicant\u2019s \nassertion that he is currently making payments. He testified that he lived in an apartment \nfrom May 2017 until September 2017. He moved out after he realized he could not afford \nthe $2,200 monthly rent. He unsuccessfully tried to break the lease, and the apartment \ncomplex started garnishing his wages in October 2017 for the remainder of the lease. \nAccording to Applicant, he established a payment arrangement with the creditor in \nJanuary 2022, and this is the only debt that remains outstanding, with a balance of \n$10,000. The documentary evidence reflects that the creditor renewed its garnishment in \nMay 2022.

Applicant testified that he paid both tickets \nand would provide supporting documentation, but failed to do so. (GE 7; Tr. 72-73, 82) \nAt the hearing, Applicant testified he purchased a home in March 2022 for \n$550,000. He used his Servicemen\u2019s Readjustment Act of 1944 (GI Bill) benefits to \npurchase the home. He argued that he qualified for financing, because he resolved the \ndebts alleged in the SOR. He testified that his divorce negatively affected his finances, as \nhis ex-wife abused her general Power of Attorney during his deployment in 2013 to 2014, \nby taking loans and credit cards out in his name, including some of the SOR allegations. \nAdditionally, she overspent and failed to pay bills. She incurred approximately $14,000 of \ndebt in his name and took $10,000 of income he had saved. (Tr. 30, 78-80) \nApplicant is current on the child support obligations for his oldest son, which is \n$715 monthly. He is not currently required to make payments for his younger son. His \nwife maintains a written budget, but he did not provide a copy of it after the hearing. He \ncould not remember his annual salary. At the time of the hearing, he had between $4,000 \nand $5,000 in savings and approximately $26,000 in his 401(k). He has filed his state and \nfederal income tax returns and has no tax-related debt. He and his wife are currently \nattempting to secure a financial advisor. He has not disclosed or discussed the debts \nalleged in the SOR with his supervisor or Facility Security Officer.

Since he started working for his current employer, he has received \npromotions and \u201cgreat evaluations each year.\u201d (Tr. 36-37, 54-55, 91-92) \nPolicies \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG), which became \neffective on June 8, 2017. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in conjunction \nwith the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation of potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nThe concern under Guideline F (Financial considerations) is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds . . . .   \nApplicant\u2019s admissions and the documentary evidence establish the following \ndisqualifying conditions under AG \u00b6 19: \n(a) Inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations.  \nAG \u00b6 20 describes conditions that could mitigate security concerns. The following \nare potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; and \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nApplicant\u2019s financial issues started due to his ex-wife\u2019s mismanagement of his \nfinancial affairs during one of his deployments between 2013 and 2014; however, he \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n   \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nfailed to demonstrate that he acted responsibly in the intervening years to address his \ndelinquent debts. The record lacks evidence of him making proactive payments toward \nany of his alleged delinquent debts. There is evidence that two of the alleged debts were \nresolved; however, one debt was resolved through an involuntary garnishment. Applicant \nclaimed one debt was settled; however, he failed to provide evidence of how much he \npaid to settle the debt. According to Appeal Board jurisprudence, Applicant is responsible \nfor proving reasonably available corroborating documentation to show debt resolution. He \ndid not meet his burden of showing his debts were resolved. \nApplicant\u2019s failure to provide documentation to demonstrate that he has resolved \nor is resolving his debts as he claimed during his multiple interactions with the government \ninvestigator between September 2019 and March 2020; in his August 2021 response to \nthe SOR; and before, during, or after his August 2, 2022 hearing, is sufficient to \ndemonstrate that he has not acted responsibly under the circumstances to address and \nresolve his financial obligations. Mitigation under AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a), 20(b), and 20(d) was not \nestablished. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the potentially \ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and circumstances \nsurrounding this case, including Applicant\u2019s honorable military service and deployments. \nI have incorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. \nOverall, he has not demonstrated the actions of a responsible, reliable, and trustworthy \nperson. I conclude he did not meet his burden of proof and persuasion. He failed to \nmitigate the financial considerations security concerns. \nFormal Findings \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n__________________________ \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:   \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.b: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.c:  \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.d \u2013 1.g:  \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.h: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.i \u2013 1.l: \n \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national interest of the United \nStates to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nEligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nCAROLINE E.

His admissions are incorporated in my findings of fact. Applicant is a 57-year-old network operations supervisor employed by a defense contractor since November 2008. He served in the Army National Guard from June 1989 to May 2005 and received an honorable discharge. He receives disability pay of about $958 per month for a 50% service-connected disability. (Tr-1 at 36.) He married in June 1994 and has two adult children. He has received a security clearance in June 2010. The SOR alleges failure to file a federal income tax return for 2018 as required and pay the taxes due. It also alleges a delinquent personal loan, a delinquent credit-card account, and a debt for a motorcycle purchase. The four delinquent consumer debts are reflected in credit reports from January, September, and June 2020 (GX 2, 3, and 4.) The evidence concerning the debts alleged in the SOR is summarized below. SOR \u00b6 1.a: failure to file a federal income tax return for 2018 and failure to pay about $5,500 in federal taxes due for 2018.

Department Counsel was ready to proceed on June 7, 2022, the \ncase was assigned to an administrative judge on June 15, 2022, and was scheduled for \n1 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nhearing on July 19, 2022. As the hearing proceeded and both sides submitted their \nevidence, the assigned administrative judge realized that he had been the department \ncounsel in a previous case involving Applicant in June 2010, after which Applicant\u2019s \napplication for a security clearance was granted. (ISCR Case No. 09-03772 (A.J., Jun. \n10, 2010).) \nAs a result of this realization, Applicant requested a hearing before another \nadministrative judge, his request was granted without objection, and the July 19, 2022 \nhearing was terminated. The case was subsequently reassigned to me on August 9, \n2022. \nOn August 19, 2022, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) notified \nApplicant that a new hearing was scheduled to be conducted by video teleconference on \nSeptember 16, 2022. I convened the hearing as scheduled. Government Exhibits (GX) 1 \nthrough 5 and Applicant\u2019s Exhibits (AX) A through F, which had been admitted at the \nprevious hearing, were again admitted in evidence without objection. GX 6, the transcript \nof the previous hearing, also was admitted without objection. \nAt the second hearing, Applicant testified and submitted AX G through O, which \nwere admitted without objection. At Applicant\u2019s request, I kept the record open until\nOctober 17, 2022, to enable him to submit additional documentary evidence. He timely\nsubmitted AX P, which was admitted without objection. Department Counsel\u2019s comments\nregarding AX P are attached to the record as Hearing Exhibit I. DOHA received the\ntranscript of the first hearing (Tr-1; GX 6) on July 28, 2022, and the transcript of the\nsecond hearing (Tr-2) on September 28, 2022. \n \n \n \n \n \nFindings of Fact \nIn Applicant\u2019s answer to the SOR, he admitted the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and \n1.d and denied the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b and 1.e. His admissions are incorporated \nin my findings of fact.  \nApplicant is a 57-year-old network operations supervisor employed by a defense \ncontractor since November 2008. He served in the Army National Guard from June 1989 \nto May 2005 and received an honorable discharge. He receives disability pay of about \n$958 per month for a 50% service-connected disability. (Tr-1 at 36.) He married in June \n1994 and has two adult children. He has received a security clearance in June 2010. \nThe SOR alleges failure to file a federal income tax return for 2018 as required and \npay the taxes due. It also alleges a delinquent personal loan, a delinquent credit-card \naccount, and a debt for a motorcycle purchase. The four delinquent consumer debts are \nreflected in credit reports from January, September, and June 2020 (GX 2, 3, and 4.) The \nevidence concerning the debts alleged in the SOR is summarized below. \nSOR \u00b6 1.a: failure to file a federal income tax return for 2018 and failure to \npay about $5,500 in federal taxes due for 2018.

When a security investigator interviewed him in January 2020, he told the \ninvestigator that he hired someone to file his tax returns, but the person took his money \nand did not file the returns. He told the investigator that a lawsuit against the tax preparer \nwas pending (GX 5 at 3.) He repeated this explanation at the first hearing. (Tr-1 at 88.) \nHe hired another tax preparer and filed his 2018 return in September 2022. It reflected \nthat he owed $3,696, and he made a $50 payment. (AX H; AX I.) There is no evidence \nthat the 2018 return had been accepted or processed as of the date of the hearing before \nme. \nApplicant testified that he is waiting to see if the IRS accepts his $50 payment. He \nprovided no evidence that he has requested a payment plan with the IRS. Instead, he is \npassively waiting to see how the IRS responds to his token payment. He asserted that he \nis willing to pay whatever the IRS asks him to pay. He testified he is able to pay the full \namount, but he has other matters that require his attention and he wants to give himself \n\u201csome financial leeway.\u201d (Tr-2 at 21.) \nApplicant testified that he received a letter two days before the second hearing \ninforming him that he owes about $1,800 for tax year 2020. (Tr-2 at 25.) Later in the \nhearing, he testified that he had just received a letter from the IRS informing him that he \nowed $2,300 for tax year 2020. (Tr-2 at 48.) He also testified that he had recently obtained \na home-equity loan for $46,000 that he intended to use to pay all his debts. (Tr-2 at 53.) \nIn October 2022, Applicant paid $2,390 for his 2020 federal income taxes and \n$1,892 for his 2021 federal income taxes. (AX P.) The taxes due for these two years have \nbeen paid in full. As of the date the record closed, he had not made any more payments \non his 2018 taxes and did not have a payment agreement for that year\u2019s taxes. His tax \ndebt for 2018 is not resolved. \nSOR \u00b6 1.b: past-due debt of $6,034 for a solar panel system. Applicant initially \ndid not recognize this debt because the vendor has the same name as a well-known \nautomobile manufacturer. He disputed the debt because the installation of the solar \npanels was faulty and resulted in roof leaks. In September 2022, he resolved the debt on \nfavorable terms. (AX L; AX M.) \nSOR \u00b6 1.c: unsecured personal loan charged off for $25,979. This debt \noriginated as a five-year personal loan for $30,000. Applicant testified that he obtained \nthis loan in 2012 and paid approximately $700 per month for about four years. (Tr-1 at \n62; Tr-2 at 35.) He used this loan to finance a vacation trip overseas in June 2014 and \u201ca \nlittle bit of extra savings.\u201d (GX 1 at 24; Tr-1 at 63.) When a security investigator interviewed \nhim in February 2020, he told the investigator that he disputed the debt and it was \n\u201cdropped\u201d by the creditor. (GX 5 at 2.) \nAt the first hearing, Applicant testified that he contacted the creditor because he \nreceived a bill reflecting a balance that he thought was incorrect. He called the creditor \nbut the agent he spoke to simply transferred him to another agent, and no one could verify \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \nthe amount due.

(Tr-1 at 67-71.) \nAt the second hearing, Applicant testified that he thought he paid a lump sum to \nsettle the debt, but he was not sure. (Tr-2 at 40. The January 2020 credit report reflected \nthat the account was closed by the grantor and charged off in January 2015.

He did not produce \nany documents supporting his dispute or showing resolution of his dispute. \nSOR \u00b6 1.d: credit-card account charged off for $12,804.

It is not reflected on the credit reports from June 2020 and September 2020. \nApplicant disputed the amount due on this account at the same time he disputed the debt \nin SOR \u00b6 1.c. (Tr-1 at 75.) SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d and 1.c involve the same creditor, a credit union. \nHe submitted no documents supporting his dispute and no documents reflecting the \nresolution of this debt. (Tr-2-at 44.) \nSOR \u00b6 1.e: debt for purchase of a motorcycle placed for collection of $1,791. \nIn July 2021, Applicant resolved this debt by trading in the motorcycle for which the debt \nwas due on a new motorcycle. He received $5,000 for trading in the old motorcycle, paid \n$8,000 in cash, and financed the balance of $13,792. (AX J, AX K, AX N, and AX O.) \nApplicant\u2019s mother was diagnosed with stage 4 lung cancer in 2014, and over the \nnext several years, went through chemotherapy and brain radiation, developed dementia, \nand contracted COVID. When she was first diagnosed, she was expected to live for six \nmonths, but she survived for six years. She moved in with Applicant in the summer of \n2015. Applicant incurred uninsured expenses for treatment, medical equipment, and \nhome attendants. He frequently lost time at work caring for her. His SCA reflects multiple \nmedical expenses that he disputed. (GX 1 at 33-37.) He disclosed in his SCA that he fell \nbehind on his home mortgage payments totaling $2,800. (GX 1 at 32-33.) When his \nmother passed away in December 2020, he incurred about $8,000 in funeral and burial \nexpenses.

These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge \napplies these guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \n\u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 15-01253 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2016). \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, \nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-\n31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).  \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-\n20700 at 3 (App. Bd.

An individual who is financially \noverextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or otherwise \nquestionable acts to generate funds. . . .  \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified information to raise money. It encompasses concerns about a \nperson\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting classified \ninformation. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information. See ISCR \nCase No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \nApplicant\u2019s admissions and the evidence submitted at the two hearings establish \nthe following disqualifying conditions under this guideline: \nAG \u00b6 19(a): inability to satisfy debts; \nAG \u00b6 19(b): unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so; \nAG \u00b6 19(c): a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \nAG \u00b6 19(f): failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local \nincome tax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax as required. \nThe following mitigating conditions are potentially relevant: \nAG \u00b6 20(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not \ncast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \nAG \u00b6 20(b): the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(c): the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling \nfor the problem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit \ncredit counseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem \nis being resolved or is under control; \nAG \u00b6 20(d): the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to \nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts;  \nAG \u00b6 20(e): the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy \nof the past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue; and \nAG \u00b6 20(g): the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax \nauthority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \nAG \u00b6 20(a) is not established. Applicant\u2019s delinquent debts are numerous, recent, \nand were not incurred under circumstances making recurrence unlikely. \nAG \u00b6 20(b) is not fully established. The long illness and death of Applicant\u2019s mother \nwere circumstances largely beyond his control. He acted responsibly by resolving the \nmedical bills and funeral costs. He modified his home mortgage loan and it is now current. \nThe fraud and theft by a tax preparer he hired to prepare his return for tax year 2018, if it \noccurred, was a condition largely beyond his control, but it is unclear why he attributed \nhis failure to file the return to \u201cillnesses\u201d in his SCA. Even if he was defrauded, he did not \nact responsibly. He acknowledged in his September 2019 SCA and during his security \ninterview in January 2020 that he had not filed the 2018 return, and he knew that it raised \na security concern. Nevertheless, he did not file the past-due 2018 return until September \n2022, after the first hearing and more than three years past the due date. An applicant \nwho waits until his clearance is in jeopardy before resolving financial issues \u201cmay be \nlacking in the judgment expected of those with access to classified information.\u201d ISCR \nCase No. 16-01211 (App. Bd. May 30, 2018) citing ISCR Case No. 15-03208 at 5 (App. \nBd. Mar. 7, 2017). The fact that Applicant has filed his past-due return \u201cdoes not preclude \ncareful consideration of Applicant\u2019s security worthiness based on longstanding prior \nbehavior evidencing irresponsibility.\u201d ISCR Case No. 12-05053 (App. Bd.

When the record \nclosed on October 17, 2022, he had been approved for a $46,000 home-equity loan, \nwhich was more than enough to pay his federal taxes for 2020 and 2021. He admitted at \nthe second hearing that he was able to pay the 2018 taxes, but that he had \u201cother matters \nthat require his attention\u201d and he wanted to give himself \u201csome financial leeway.\u201d That \nfinancial leeway apparently included an $8,000 down payment on a new motorcycle. \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \nAt the second hearing, Applicant declared that he intends to use the home-equity \nloan to pay all his debts, including his tax debt. However, \u201cpromises to pay or otherwise \nresolve delinquent debts in the future are not a substitute for a track record of paying \ndebts in a timely manner or otherwise acting in a financially responsible manner.\u201d ISCR \nCase No. 17-04110 (App. Bd. Sep. 26, 2019). \nAG \u00b6 20(d) is not established for the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.c, or 1.d. It is \nestablished for the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.b and 1.e. The fact that the debts alleged in \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c and 1.d are no longer reflected on credit reports does not establish any \nmeaningful, independent evidence as to the disposition of the debt. Debts may fall off \ncredit reports for various reasons, including the passage of time. See, e.g., ISCR Case \nNo. 18-01250 at 2 (App. Bd. Feb. 13, 2019). \nAG \u00b6 20(e) is not established. Although Applicant claimed that he disputed the \ndebts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c and 1.d, he provided no documentary evidence of the basis for his \ndispute and no documentary evidence of efforts to resolve the disputes. \nAG \u00b6 20(g) is not fully established. Applicant has filed the past-due 2018 return, \nbut he submitted no evidence of payment or a payment agreement beyond the single $50 \npayment. His eventual compliance with his obligation to timely file a return does not end \nthe inquiry. A security clearance adjudication is not a tax-enforcement procedure. It is an \nevaluation of an individual\u2019s judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. The fact that \nApplicant has filed his past-due 2018 return \u201cdoes not preclude careful consideration of \n[his] \nsecurity \nworthiness \nbased \non \nlongstanding \nprior \nbehavior \nevidencing \nirresponsibility.\u201d ISCR Case No. 12-05053 (App. Bd. Oct. 30, 2014). The unexplained \nthree-year delay in filing the 2018 return diminishes the mitigating effect of filing it. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-\nperson concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process \nfactors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nI have incorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis \nand applied the adjudicative factors in AG \u00b6 2(d).

(GE 1) \nApplicant did not report his defaulted student loans on the SF 86 under any of the \nfinancial questions. He initially testified that he did not report his student loans because \nhe thought they were in deferment. He stated that he called the student loan provider \nwhen he was out of work and asked if his loans could be deferred until he found a job. \nWhen he was asked why after 20 years of no payments, he would call the provider and \nask for a deferment, he changed his story to he did not call the student loan provider for \na deferment, he called the credit card companies. He stated that he did not report the \nstudent loans on the SF 86 because he thought they had been discharged in \nbankruptcy. (Tr. at 29, 32-33, 39-44; GE 1) \nApplicant did not report his delinquent federal income taxes on the SF 86 under \nany of the financial questions, including questions that asked: \u201cIn the last seven (7) \nyears have you failed to file or pay Federal, state, or other taxes when required by law \nor ordinance?\u201d and if: \u201cYou are currently delinquent on any Federal debt.\u201d \nApplicant submitted a personal financial statement at his hearing that reported a \nmonthly remainder of $3,639 after deductions, liabilities, and expenses were deducted \nfrom his gross income. It did not include any deductions for federal and state income \ntaxes. When asked if he owed any federal and state income taxes, he asserted that he \nwas paying his state about $500 per month toward a debt of $40,000 to $45,000. (Tr. at \n44-46, 50; AE E) As to the IRS, he was asked: \nAJ: And how much do you owe the IRS? \nApplicant: It\u2019s - - right now currently I don\u2019t owe the IRS. \nAJ: You don\u2019t owe the IRS? \nApplicant: Right now, currently I don\u2019t. (Tr. at 46-47) \nWhen pressed, Applicant admitted that he probably owed the IRS about $50,000 \nto $70,000, including about $10,000 for 2020. (Tr. at 47-50) At the reconvened hearing, \nhe was evasive and never gave an actual amount that he owed the IRS, but estimated a \nfigure of $100,000. (Tr.2 at 9-14, 21-22) \nIn January 2022, Applicant contracted with a tax attorney to represent his \ninterests with the IRS. He agreed to pay the attorney $11,273 for his fees, payable in 17 \nmonthly payments of $626, through May 2023. Applicant\u2019s 2013 bankruptcy petition \nreported that he owed $127,074 to the IRS for taxes owed through 2011.

(AE A) \nPolicies \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG), which became \neffective on June 8, 2017. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n6 \n\n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; \n(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so; \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired. \nApplicant\u2019s has a history of financial problems, including bankruptcies, delinquent \ndebts, defaulted student loans, and unpaid federal and state taxes. AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a), 19(c), \nand 19(f) are applicable. While I accept that some of Applicant\u2019s financial problems \noccurred because he was unable to pay his debts, his defaulted student loans and \nunpaid taxes went on for so long, I conclude that he was unwilling to pay them. AG \u00b6 \n19(b) is applicable. \nConditions that could mitigate the financial considerations security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 20. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment;  \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control; \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue; and \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax \nauthority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s bankruptcies occurred in 2013 and 2014. Those allegations (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 \n1.a and 1.b) are mitigated. He paid or settled the debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d and 1.e. Those \nallegations are also mitigated.  \nApplicant went decades without paying his student loans and taxes. He entered \ninto a loan rehabilitation program in February 2021, shortly after the SOR was issued, to \nmake nine monthly payments of $49. He made the required payments, and his loan is \nrehabilitated and back in good standing. In October 2021, he entered into a payment \nagreement with his state to pay $500 per month toward his income tax debt of \n$124,998. He paid $1,500 for the first three months. An applicant who begins to resolve \nsecurity concerns only after having been placed on notice that his or her clearance is in \njeopardy may lack the judgment and willingness to follow rules and regulations when his \nor her personal interests are not threatened. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 17-04110 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Sep. 26, 2019). \nThe status of Applicant\u2019s federal income taxes is murky at best. He did not report \nthat he owed taxes on his 2019 SF 86; he initially testified that he did not owe the IRS; \nhe changed his testimony to owing about $40,000; he testified at the reconvened \nhearing that he owed about $100,000; but his bankruptcy petitions reported that he \nowed the IRS $136,469 in 2014, and it does not include additional penalties and interest \nor the amounts owed for tax years after 2013. Applicant had almost three months \nbetween the first and second hearing and the assistance of his counsel and tax \nattorney, but he still provided no documentation about how much he actually owed the \nIRS. Absent any documented proof from Applicant, his testimony that he owes the IRS \nabout $100,000 is not credible. He stated that he intended to pay his taxes. However, \nintentions to pay debts in the future are not a substitute for a track record of debt \nrepayment or other responsible approaches. See ISCR Case No. 11-14570 at 3 (App. \nBd. Oct. 23, 2013). \nFailure to comply with tax laws suggests that an applicant has a problem with \nabiding by well-established government rules and systems. Voluntary compliance with \nrules and systems is essential for protecting classified information. See, e.g., ISCR \nCase No. 16-01726 at 5 (App. Bd. Feb. 28, 2018). A person who fails repeatedly to fulfill \nhis or her legal obligations, such as filing tax returns and paying taxes when due, does \nnot demonstrate the high degree of good judgment and reliability required of those \ngranted access to classified information. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 17-01382 at 4 (App. \nBd. May 16, 2018). \nAfter decades of neglect on his student loans and taxes, his recent payments on \ndebts that are well into six figures are too little, too late. There is insufficient evidence for \na determination that Applicant\u2019s financial problems will be resolved within a reasonable \nperiod. I am unable to find that he acted responsibly under the circumstances or that he \nmade a good-faith effort to pay his student loans and taxes. His financial issues are \nrecent and ongoing. They continue to cast doubt on his current reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and good judgment. I find that the security concerns arising out of \nApplicant\u2019s defaulted student loans and unpaid taxes are not mitigated. \n8 \n\n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                          \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \nThe security concern for personal conduct is set out in AG \u00b6 15, as follows: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process. \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. The following disqualifying condition is potentially applicable: \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or \nsimilar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment \nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance \neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities. \nApplicant did not report his defaulted student loans and unpaid taxes on his 2019 \nSF 86. He provided inconsistent testimony about why he did not report the student \nloans. He initially stated that he called the student loan provider when he was out of \nwork and asked if his loans could be deferred until he found a job. He later testified that \nhe meant that the credit cards were deferred, and he thought the student loans had \nbeen discharged in bankruptcy. He stated that he misinterpreted the \u201cand/or\u201d nature of \nthe tax questions. \nDepartment Counsel conceded in his closing argument that Applicant \u201cgenuinely \ndid not understand the and/or situation [in the SF 86] and the question about filing or \npaying taxes.\u201d He argued that Applicant nonetheless, intentionally failed to report his \nunpaid taxes under the second question. Applicant argued that I am bound by \nDepartment Counsel\u2019s concession. I disagree. \nI considered all the evidence, including Applicant\u2019s age, education, experience, \nreading disorder, and the sometimes problematic use of \u201cor.\u201d I also considered \nApplicant\u2019s inconsistent testimony about his student loans, his initially false testimony \nthat he did not owe the IRS, and his evasive testimony about his taxes. I find by \nsubstantial evidence1 that he intentionally omitted information about his defaulted \n1  Substantial evidence is \u201csuch relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to \nsupport a conclusion in light of all the contrary evidence in the same record.\u201d See, e.g., ISCR Case No. \n17-04166 at 3 (App. Bd. Mar. 21, 2019) (citing Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1). \u201cThis is something less than the \nweight of the evidence, and the possibility of drawing two inconsistent conclusions from the evidence \ndoes not prevent [a Judge\u2019s] finding from being supported by substantial evidence.\u201d Consolo v.

AG \u00b6 16(a) is applicable. \nAG \u00b6 17 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. The following \nare potentially applicable: \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; \n(b) the refusal or failure to cooperate, omission, or concealment was \ncaused or significantly contributed to by advice of legal counsel or of a \nperson with professional responsibilities for advising or instructing the \nindividual specifically concerning security processes. Upon being made \naware of the requirement to cooperate or provide the information, the \nindividual cooperated fully and truthfully; \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, \nunreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely \nto recur; and \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate \nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress. \nApplicant denied that he lied on the SF 86. Having determined that he \nintentionally omitted information about his defaulted student loans and unpaid taxes in \nan attempt to mislead the government, I have also determined that his explanations that \nthe omissions were unintentional were also false. It would be inconsistent to find his \nconduct mitigated.2 Without complete candor, there are no applicable mitigating \nconditions. \n2 See ISCR Case 03-22819 at 4 (App. Bd. Mar. 20, 2006), in which the Appeal Board reversed the \nAdministrative Judge\u2019s decision to grant Applicant\u2019s security clearance: \nOnce the Administrative Judge found that Applicant deliberately falsified a security \nclearance application in September 2002, the Judge could not render a favorable security \nclearance decision without articulating a rational basis for why it would be clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant \ndespite the falsification. Here, the Judge gives reasons as to why he considers the \nfalsification mitigated under a \u201cwhole person\u201d analysis, namely that Applicant has \nmatured, has held a position of responsibility, recognizes how important it is to be candid \nin relation to matters relating to her security clearance, and has changed her behavior so \nthat there is little likelihood of recurrence. However, the Judge\u2019s conclusion runs contrary \n10 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                           \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n(1) The nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guidelines E and F in my whole-person analysis. I also considered \nApplicant\u2019s favorable character evidence. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude Applicant did not \nmitigate the personal conduct and financial considerations security concerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.b: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.c: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.d-1.e: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.f-1.g: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline E: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 2.a: \nAgainst Applicant \nto the Judge\u2019s rejection of Applicant\u2019s explanations for the security clearance application \nfalsification. At the hearing (after earlier admitting the falsification in her March 2003 \nwritten statement to a security investigator), Applicant testified that she had not \nintentionally falsified her application. Given the Judge\u2019s rejection of this explanation as \nnot being credible, it follows that the Judge could not have concluded Applicant now \nrecognizes the importance of candor and has changed her behavior. \n11 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nConclusion \nIt is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for \na security clearance.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant is 53 years old. He has been married to his second wife since July 2001. His first marriage ended in divorce in June 1996. He has five biological adult-aged children and a goddaughter that he has raised as his own. He still supports one of his daughters and her two sons. He has been working for an emergency management business since March 2021. Before that job, Applicant was a logistics manager from August 2019 to March 2021.

He did not provide supporting evidence addressing the financial issues. He did \nnot mitigate the guidelines for personal conduct and financial considerations. Applicant\u2019s \neligibility for security clearance access is denied. \nStatement of the Case \nOn November 20, 2019, Applicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaire for \nInvestigations Processing (e-QIP) for security clearance eligibility so that he could work \nfor a defense contractor. On January 10, 2006, November 1, 2012, and February 12, \n2020, he provided personal subject interviews (PSIs) to an investigator from the Office \nof Personnel Management (OPM). On December 29, 2020, \nthe Defense \nCounterintelligence Security Agency (DCSA) Consolidated Adjudications Facility (CAF) \ncould not make the necessary affirmative finding to grant Applicant\u2019s security clearance \nand issued an SOR to him detailing security concerns under financial considerations \n(Guideline F) and personal conduct (Guideline E).

I held the hearing as scheduled. I admitted the Government\u2019s 24 exhibits (GE) 1-\n24 into evidence without objection.

On July 13, \n2022, I admitted Applicant\u2019s six post-hearing exhibits into evidence without objection. \n(AE A-AE F) On July 14, 2022, Applicant sent an updated credit bureau report link by \nemail. I did not receive the report because the computer link could not be established to \ntransmit the proposed exhibit. DOHA received the transcript (Tr.) on July 12, 2022. The \nrecord closed on July 14, 2022.  \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant is 53 years old. He has been married to his second wife since July \n2001. His first marriage ended in divorce in June 1996.

In his November 2019 e-QIP, he denied receiving credit counseling in \nthe last seven years. There is no indication in the record that Applicant has ever had \ncredit or financial counseling. I take official notice that at the time he filed the petition in \nAugust 2012, he had to take a credit-counseling course as a condition of filing the \nbankruptcy petition. (GE 1 at 53; GE 2 at 23-25; GE 3-5) \nThe total amount of delinquent debt from SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b through 1.e is $13,735. \nThe listed debts transitioned to past-due debt status between May 2013 and January \n2020. (GE 2 at 25; GE 3-5) \nSOR \u00b6 1.b is a delinquent installment car loan. The account became delinquent \nin May 2013. (GE 3 at 2; GE 4 at 5) Applicant admitted the debt. He cosigned for a car \nthat his wife was purchasing. Someone told him that his name would be removed from \nthe contract if payments were consistently made for a year. According to Applicant, after \nmaking payments for several years, his wife became ill and they tried to settle the \noutstanding balance of about $9,000 as the car was not worth more than $500. The \ndealer repossessed the car. (GE 2 at 24; Tr. 45-47) Even though he submitted no \nsupporting documentation, he claimed that he is still disputing the balance. The account \nis unresolved. \nApplicant denied 1.c, 1.d, and 1.e because they were included in his November \n2012 bankruptcy and they no longer appear on his credit report. He claimed that he had \ndocumentation verifying that the accounts were included in his bankruptcy. (Tr. 49) SOR \n\u00b6 1.c is a cell phone account that became delinquent in March 2015. (GE 3 at 2) SOR \u00b6 \n1.d is a credit card account that became delinquent in March 2014. SOR \u00b6 1.e is a \ncollection account for a cable television. (GE 2 at 24; GE 2 at 3-4; GE 4 at 6) Applicant \nsubmitted no documentation in support of his claim. The accounts are still unresolved. \n \nPersonal Conduct \nSOR \u00b6 2.a indicates that Applicant, at age 24, was charged with felony \npossession of marijuana with intent to distribute in April 1996. He admitted the offense. \nHe was sentenced to 18 months, with 18 months of probation. He was released from \nprobation early because of good behavior, and placed on work release. He claimed the \nrecord was sealed by the judge or the probation officer, allowing him to reenlist in the \nUSAR in November 2003. Applicant claimed that a clerk of the court supposedly \ninformed Applicant that the judge had expunged the information because it was too old. \n(GE 2 at 19; Tr. 49-51) See SOR \u00b6 2.j. \nSOR 2.b alleges that in January 1997, Applicant was charged with failure to \nappear and fraudulent use of a birth certificate/driver\u2019s license. He admitted the charge \nand explained the court dates for this case in State X were the same as the court dates \nof another case in State Y. (SOR \u00b6 2.a.) He knew that he was not permitted to drive, but \nhis friend decided not to drive to the court in State Y.

He received a \nday in jail. (Tr. 51, 53-54) \nSOR \u00b6 2.c refers to a fugitive from justice charge filed in February 1997 by the \npresiding judge in the SOR \u00b6 2.a case (State Y), when Applicant did not appear \nbecause he was sitting in jail in State X. He admitted the offense. After his transfer back \nto the court in State Y (SOR \u00b6 2.a), the judge dropped the fugitive from justice bench \nwarrant. (Tr. 54) \nSOR \u00b6 2.d alleges that in September 1998, Applicant was charged with \ndriving with a suspended license, second offense. He admitted the offense and noted \nthat he previously drove to and from work on a suspended license on several \noccasions. (Tr. 55) \nSOR \u00b6 2.e indicates that in March 1999, Applicant, when he was 30 years of \nage, was found in State X to be a habitual offender, and his driver\u2019s license was \nrevoked for 10 years. Applicant admitted the habitual-offender designation. He testified \nthat after he paid the associated fines and fees, he was able to receive a restricted \ndriver\u2019s license for a year, and then his driving privileges were fully restored. There are \nno current restrictions on his license. (Tr. 55-56) \nSOR 2.f is an October 1999 probation violation relating to the offense described \nin SOR \u00b6 2.a (the \u00b6 1.a reference in the allegation is incorrect.) Though he denied this \nallegation in his answer, after reading pertinent parts of GE 13 (a one-page exhibit), \nApplicant agreed that he served two days incarceration. (GE 13; Tr. 56-59) \nSOR \u00b6 2.g was a revoked operator\u2019s license charge that occurred in November \n1999, and that Applicant admitted. Instead of a ten-day sentence, Applicant recalled \nspending less than a day in jail. (Tr. 59-60) \nSOR \u00b6 2.h refers to the charges that were filed against him in April 2001 for \ndriving while under the influence (DUI), driving on a suspended license, and carrying the \ndriver\u2019s license of another person. At the time he was stopped, he had his restricted \nlicense. However, the police checked his wallet and found he had his brother\u2019s license. \nApplicant was convicted of DUI and use of a birth certificate, a reduced misdemeanor \noffense of being in possession of another person\u2019s driver\u2019s license. He claimed that this \nwas the only time he was found with his brother\u2019s driver\u2019s license, even though he was \nin possession of his brother\u2019s license in January 1997. See SOR \u00b6 2.b. (Tr. 60-61) \nSOR \u00b6 2.i alleges that Applicant used marijuana on several occasions between \n2000 and 2002. He admitted using marijuana during the period and testing positive for \nmarijuana use in April 2001, during his military service.

These guidelines, which are flexible rules of law, are applied together with \ncommon sense and the general factors of the whole-person concept.

Failure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, \nor unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can \nraise questions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and \nability to protect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress \ncan also be caused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible \nindicator of, other issues of personnel security concern such as \nexcessive gambling, mental health conditions, substance misuse, or \nalcohol abuse or dependence. An individual who is financially \noverextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or \notherwise questionable acts to generate funds. Affluence that \ncannot be explained by known sources of income is also a security \nconcern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nAG \u00b6 19. Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying include: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \n7 \n\n   \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe record indicates that Applicant received a Chapter 7 Bankruptcy discharge \nin November 2012, but encountered continuing financial problems. There are four \ndelinquent accounts listed in the SOR totaling approximately $13,735. The accounts \nbecame delinquent between May 2013 and 2020. The record supports application of \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and 19(c). \nAG \u00b6 20. Conditions that could mitigate security concerns include: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or \nseparation, clear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity \ntheft), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for \nthe problem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit \ncredit counseling service, and there are clear indications that the \nproblem is being resolved or is under control; and \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay\noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \n \nApplicant received a Chapter 7 Bankruptcy discharge in November 2012. He \nand his wife demonstrated good judgment in maintaining car payments (SOR \u00b6 1.b) for \nsix years (circa 2018), and trying to negotiate a settlement on the car when they \ndiscovered their overall payments exceeded the value of the car. Nevertheless, \nApplicant provided no evidence of action taken on the account after 2018. He furnished \nno corroborating evidence to bolster his claim that he is still disputing the debt. \nRegarding SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c, 1.d, and 1.e, Applicant asserted that the debts no \nlonger appear in his credit report. However, he supplied no evidence to support his \nclaim that the debts were included in his 2012 bankruptcy. Even though the running of \nthe state statute of limitations is the reason for the removal of the accounts from \nApplicant\u2019s credit report, the accounts remain his responsibility and he still has not \nresolved them. The DOHA Appeal Board has consistently held that reliance on a state \nlimitations statute does not translate to a good-faith effort to resolve financial problems. \nISCR Case No. 15-01208 at 3 (App. Bd. Aug. 26, 2016) Applicant\u2019s lack of a meaningful \nrecord of payments to resolve the delinquent debts raises continuing concerns about his \njudgment and reliability.

However, Applicant\u2019s \nreliance on the statute of limitations instead of paying on the delinquent accounts, or \nattempting to arrange a payment plan with the creditors, or keeping the creditors \nperiodically aware of Applicant\u2019s financial problems, are not responsible actions under \nthe circumstances. The second prong of AG \u00b6 20(b) does not apply. \nAs a condition of filing his Chapter 7 Bankruptcy in August 2012, Applicant had \nto complete a credit-counseling course. However, there is no indication in the record \nthat he has ever had additional financial counseling. In sum, Applicant receives limited \nmitigation under the first prong of AG \u00b6 20(c), but no mitigation under the second prong \nof the condition because there is no clear indication the overdue accounts are being \nresolved or under control. \nPersonal Conduct \nThe security concern for personal conduct is set forth in AG \u00b6 15: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, \nor unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect classified information. Of special interest is any failure to \nprovide truthful and candid answers during the national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. The following will normally \nresult in an unfavorable national security eligibility determination, \nsecurity clearance action, or cancellation or further processing for \nnational security eligibility.  \nThe potential disqualifying conditions under AG \u00b6 16 are: \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from any \npersonnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar form \nused to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, award \nbenefits or status, determine national security eligibility or trustworthiness, or \naward fiduciary responsibilities; \n(c) credible adverse information in several adjudicative areas that is not \nsufficient for an adverse determination under any other single \nguideline, but which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-\nperson assessment of questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, \nunreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and \nregulations, or other characteristics indicating that he may not properly \nsafeguard classified or sensitive information; \n9 \n\n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(d) credible adverse information that is not explicitly covered under any \nother guideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an adverse \ndetermination, but which, when combined with all available information, \nsupports a whole-person assessment of questionable judgment, \nuntrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply \nwith rules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that the \nindividual may not properly safeguard classified or sensitive \ninformation.

Upon being made \naware of the requirement to cooperate or provide the information, the \nindividual cooperated truthfully; \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior \nis so infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it \nis unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; and \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained \ncounseling to change the behavior or taken other positive steps to \nalleviate the stressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to \nuntrustworthy, unreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such \nbehavior is unlikely to recur. \nAG \u00b6 17(a) does not apply. Applicant did not attempt to correct the \nfalsifications during the course of the security investigation. \nApplicant claimed he concealed the felony and other drug information during \nthe security investigation because a judge, or a probation officer indicated that it was \nexpunged. A clerk of the court supposedly informed Applicant that the judge had \nexpunged the information because it was too old. I do not find these explanations \npersuasive. The more persuasive reasons which he stated repeatedly in his answer and \nat the hearing, were that he deliberately falsified the forms to protect his current \nemployment or enhance his chances of landing new employment so that he could care \nand feed his family. While the record does not provide an obvious reason why Applicant \nprevaricated about his December 2004 discharge, I am not persuaded that his \nresignation in 2012 was simply due to his parent\u2019s terminal medical conditions. AG \u00b6 \n17(b) does not apply. \nApplicant\u2019s falsifications were not minor because he repeatedly filed falsified \nGovernment security forms to acquire a security clearance and obtain or retain a job. \nThe falsifications, which did not occur under unusual circumstances, raise continuing \nsecurity concerns regarding Applicant\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and judgment.

His most recent \nfalsification occurred in November 2019, less than three years before his security \nclearance hearing. He was debarred from federal employment from 2009 to 2011. A \nlittle over a year later, he was involved in the Government credit card investigation. He \nwas debarred a second time from Federal employment from July 2015 to July 2018. In \nNovember 2019, he falsified his e-QIP.

Two previous marriages ended in divorce. (GE 1 at 22-23) He has been married \nto his current wife for nearly two years.

According to his most recent \nperformance evaluation in March 2021, his quality of work and initiative are excellent. (AE \nK at 3) \nFrom 2008 to 2017, Applicant engaged in compulsive sexual behavior. This \nbehavior began shortly after he returned from his second overseas combat deployment. \nHe would seek out women and couples to have sexual intercourse on a weekly basis. \n(GE 3 at 15) He also engaged in multiple extramarital affairs. (Answer at 1) Per his \ncounselor, some of this behavior was of a public nature. (AE A at 6) \nIn 2011, Applicant sought help from a psychiatrist who diagnosed him as a sex \naddict. (Answer at 1; GE 3 at 15; AE 3 at 4) He consulted with the psychiatrist for three \nto four months. (AE A at 3) Applicant began attending therapy, consistent with his \npsychiatrist\u2019s recommendation. (GE 3 at 15; Tr. 32) He attended therapy for eight months \non a weekly basis. (EX A at 3) The psychiatrist also recommended that Applicant tell his \nthen wife about his sex addiction. (GE 3 at 15) Applicant followed his psychiatrist\u2019s advice, \nleading to her decision to seek a divorce, (GE 3 at 15) \nApplicant began dating his second wife after his divorce. He subsequently stopped \nengaging in sex with random partners. GE 3 at 15) Sometime after dating his second wife, \nApplicant stopped seeing his therapist. Consequently, he began indulging in sex with \nrandom partners again. \nIn August 2017, Applicant was tried at a summary court martial for violation of \nUniform Code of Military Justice, Article 92, violation of a lawful general order and \ndereliction of duty, and Article 93, maltreatment of a subordinate, after being involved in \na sexual encounter with two subordinates approximately nine months earlier.

(Answer at \n1; GE 4; Tr. 45) \nApplicant has not engaged in any sexually addictive behavior since December \n2017. In early 2018, he met his current wife. They married in 2019. She is aware of his \npast behavior, and characterizes him as \u201ca good, kind, caring man who works hard day \nin and day out to support [their] family . . .\u201d (GE D at 1) She is aware of his past conduct. \n(AE D at 1) \nIn October 2021, Applicant consulted with a certified addictions counselor who is \nprofessionally familiar with the adjudicative guidelines in the Directive, having evaluated \nhundreds of security clearance holders and applicants over the years. (AE A, AE B) \nDuring the consultation, Applicant elaborated on the roots of his sexual addiction, \nattributing it to what he considered, in retrospect, to have been caused by undiagnosed \npost-traumatic stress disorder, which worsened at the conclusion of his deployment when \nhe was transferred to recruitment duty. (AE A at 2) The stress of striving to meet \nrecruitment quotas led him to act out in a sexual manner by going to strip clubs, picking \nup women at bars, and engaging in sexual encounters of a public nature. (AE A at 7) The \nmore stressed he became, the more he engaged in high-risk sexual behavior. \nAccording to the therapist, Applicant\u2019s behavior \u201cwas a direct result of trying to \nreplicate the adrenaline responses during deployment, or offset the anxiety he \nexperienced as a recruiter.\u201d (AE A at 3) She characterized him as forthright, remorseful, \nand fully cooperative. (AE A at 2, 7) The standardized testing the therapist conducted \nrevealed that Applicant was in prolonged recovery from sexually acting out after his \ncombat deployment and his stint as a recruiter. (AE A at 7) The therapist ultimately \nconcluded that Applicant had no disorder and that he \u201cis not at risk of relapse or return to \nhis previous behavior.\u201d (AE A at 7) \nOn cross-examination, Department Counsel asked Applicant to provide an \napproximate number of extramarital sexual encounters that he had between 2008 and \n2017, (Tr. 34) He said that he did not recall. (Tr. 35) After he continued to be evasive in \nthis manner, I advised him of the importance of transparency to the security clearance \nprocess, and asked him to provide a \u201cball park estimate.\u201d (Tr. 35) Department counsel \nthen said the following: \nI think the Judge is asking for a ball park estimate. Do you have a ball park\nestimate of the number of extramarital sexual encounters you have had?\n(Tr. 35) \n \n \nIn response, Applicant replied,\u201d I\u2019m not going to presume a number that\u2019s not factual; \nthat\u2019s not going to happen.\u201d (Tr. 35) \nDepartment Counsel then asked Applicant whether he had ever engaged in sexual \nbehavior of a public nature.

Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). When evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security \nclearance, the administrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are required to be \nconsidered in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of \nhuman behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the \nadjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overall adjudicative goal is a fair, \nimpartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a \nconscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d \nThe administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the \nperson, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present \nevidence to establish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, \nthe applicant is responsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, \nexplain, extenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department \nCounsel. . . .\u201d The applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable \nsecurity decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation about potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Section 7 of Executive \nOrder 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall \nin no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See also EO \n12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access to classified or sensitive \ninformation). \n4 \n\n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                 \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must consider the \ntotality of an applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant circumstances in light of the nine \nadjudicative process factors in AG \u00b6 2(d).1 \nAnalysis \nGuideline D: Sexual Behavior \nThe security concerns about sexual behavior are set forth in AG \u00b6 18: \nSexual behavior that involves a criminal offense; reflects a lack of judgment \nor discretion, or may subject the individual to undue influence of coercion, \nexploitation, or duress . . . may raise questions about an individual\u2019s \njudgment, reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified or \nsensitive information. \nFrom 2008 to 2017, Applicant engaged in a pattern of compulsive, high risk sexual \nbehavior. In 2011, he was diagnosed with a sexual addiction. Applicant\u2019s problem \nreached its nadir when he was discharged under other than honorable conditions after \nengaging in a sexual encounter with two subordinates. Under these circumstances, AG \u00b6 \n13(a), \u201csexual behavior of a criminal nature . . .,\u201d AG \u00b6 13(c), \u201csexual behavior that causes \nan individual to be vulnerable to coercion, exploitation, or duress;\u201d and AG \u00b6 13(d), \u201csexual \nbehavior . . . that reflects a lack of discretion or judgment.\u201d \nIn October 2021, Applicant consulted with a counselor. After speaking with him \nand analyzing the results of a standardized test, she concluded that he was in prolonged \nrecovery, and that his sexual misconduct was unlikely to recur. Under these \ncircumstances, AG \u00b6 14(b), \u201cthe sexual behavior happened so long ago . . .., that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or judgment,\u201d and AG \u00b6 14(d), \u201cthe individual . . . has received a favorable \nprognosis from a qualified mental health professional indicating the behavior is readily \ncontrollable . . . .\u201d apply. \nApplicant\u2019s current wife is aware of his sexual addiction. Therefore, AG \u00b6 14(c), \n\u201cthe behavior no longer serves as a basis for coercion, exploitation, or duress,\u201d also \napplies. Under these circumstances, Applicant has mitigated the sexual behavior security \nconcern. \n1 The factors under AG \u00b6 2(a) are as follows: \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding \nthe conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the \nconduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other \npermanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for \npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or \nrecurrence. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________ \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \nUnder this guideline, candor and cooperation are critical components of the \ninvestigative process. Therefore, any failure to cooperate or provide truthful and candid \nanswers during national security investigative security eligibility determinations, security \nclearance actions, or cancellation of further processing for national security eligibility is \n\u201cof special interest.\u201d (AG \u00b6 15) \nApplicant provided evasive testimony, which I interpreted as an unwillingness to \ncooperate with the adjudicative process. Despite repeated admonitions from the bench, \nhe continued to be uncooperative and evasive. Applicant\u2019s failure to testify candidly, and \nhis failure to cooperate with the Court\u2019s instructions during cross-examination raise \nquestions about his judgment and trustworthiness that go to the heart of the investigative \nprocess, as set forth in AG \u00b6 15, above. These unresolved issues render Applicant an \nunacceptable security risk, notwithstanding his mitigation of the sexual behavior \nconcerns. I conclude Guideline E applies without mitigation and it is not clearly consistent \nwith the national security to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s access to classified information. \nWhole-Person Concept \nI considered the whole-person factors in my analysis of the guidelines, particularly \nGuideline E, and they do not warrant a favorable conclusion. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline D: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.d: \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline E: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance.

After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings, admissions, testimony, \nand exhibits submitted, I make the following findings of fact. \nApplicant is 44 years old. He married in 2000 and has four children, ages 15, 13, \n11 and 9. He earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in 2000 and a master\u2019s degree in 2008. He \nserved in the Army from 2003 to 2005 and was honorably discharged due to noncombat-\nrelated medical issues. Applicant disclosed on his June 2020 security clearance \napplication (SCA) that he was employed by the same federal contractor from 2005 to \n2019. He also disclosed he began employment with a different federal contractor in \nOctober 2019. At his hearing, he testified that in early 2021, he began work for another \nfederal contractor. He did not disclose any periods of unemployment in his SCA. He \ntestified that while employed the contracts would change and there were weeks when he \nwould not get paid, but he did not have any extended periods of employment since he left \nthe military. (Tr. 15-19, 82-84; GE 1) \nApplicant testified that prior to 2018, his annual salary was about $45,000. \nBeginning in 2018, his pay increased to approximately $95,000. In January 2021, his \nsalary increased to $115,000. Applicant attributed his financial problems to his wife losing \nher job in 2015, and they could not keep up with their expenses. His wife has some \nmedical issues and difficulty working full time. She resumed full-time employment 15-\nmonths ago and earns between $50,000 and $60,000 annually. Applicant stated he was \nliving off of credit to pay for food and clothing for his family after she lost her job. He also \nindicated he mismanaged his money. (Tr. 19-21, 27-28, 81, 87; GE 2) \nApplicant disclosed on his 2020 SCA that he had a judgment entered against him \nin 2009 and his wages were garnished to pay the debt. He also disclosed that because \nhis wife lost her job in 2015, they missed mortgage payments and foreclosure \nproceedings were initiated. He disclosed that he had attempted to obtain a loan \nmodification, which was denied, and he was looking for another option to resolve the debt. \nApplicant was interviewed by a government investigator in June 2020, shortly after \nhe completed his SCA. He told the investigator that in 2017 he sought a loan modification \non his mortgage, which was granted. He made some payments, but after a few months, \nhe began to miss payments again.

He said that his overall finances were now good with \nthe exception of the mortgage. He and his wife were working and paying all of their bills \non time. Because he could not obtain a loan modification at that time, he planned on \nrequesting in the next month a short-sale on the property. (GE 2) \nApplicant testified that he was making his mortgage payments from 2015 through \n2018, but had missed some payments. The company he worked for had lost a contract \nand he had to look for an opening with the next contractor, so he was not receiving \nincome. He estimated he was unemployed for about a month. He said his wife went back \nto work after she lost her job, but lost her job again. He could not recall the specific time \nperiods. He was granted a loan modification in December 2018, with the first payment \ndue January 2019. Applicant did not provide specifics regarding how many months he did \nnot make timely payments. He said the mortgage company would not accept late \npayments. They remained living in the house. He broke his ankle in July 2019 and \nalthough he had medical insurance, not all of the expenses were covered. The mortgage \nwent into foreclosure again. The creditor would not accept late payments. He did not \nmake payments from July 2019 until June 2022 when he was granted a new modification \nto his mortgage. He is current on his mortgage and provided a document to show he \nmade his August 2022 payment. (Tr. 37-51; AE B, C) \nOther than the two debts noted above, Applicant did not disclose any other \ndelinquent debts in his SCA. When he was interviewed by the government investigator, \nhe did not disclose any delinquent debts other than the mortgage. He said his finances \nwere all good except for the mortgage. He was then confronted with the delinquent debts \nand collection accounts alleged in the SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b through 1.p. (GE 2, 3) \nAll of the debts alleged in the SOR are reported on his June 2020 credit report and \nare corroborated by Applicant\u2019s testimony and statements made to the government\ninvestigator. (GE 1, 2, 3) \n \nApplicant acknowledged to the investigator the collection accounts for medical \ndebts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.j ($526) and 1.l ($203). They were incurred in approximately \nJuly 2019 when he broke his ankle. He said he could not recall they were in collection or \nwhen they were considered delinquent. He told the investigator that he had arranged a \nmonthly payment plan with the creditor three months ago and it would be paid over the \nnext year. At his hearing, he testified that these debts were \u201crecalled.\u201d He could not \nprovide an explanation for what that meant. He said he had been making payments, but \nprovided no proof of the payments. He admitted they were valid debts, but be believes \nthey were canceled. There is insufficient evidence that Applicant made payments on the \ndebts or to corroborate they have been resolved. (Tr. 69-74) \nWhen confronted by the investigator, Applicant admitted owing the debt in SOR \u00b6 \n1.f ($969). The debt was for an alarm system he had installed in his home in 2006. He \ntold the investigator he canceled the service in 2011 and was current on his payments. \nHe said he was unaware it was delinquent or that the account was in collection.

He testified that he believed the debt was paid. He provided documents \nto show he made monthly payments of $19.46 from April 2022 to August 2022. This debt \nis being resolved. (Tr. 63-64; AE E) \nApplicant was confronted by the investigator with each collection account in SOR \n\u00b6\u00b6 1.b ($4,528); 1.c ($1,943); 1.d ($1,549); 1.e ($1,439); 1.g ($942); 1.h ($542); 1.i ($536);\n1.k ($465); 1.m ($135); 1.n ($81), 1.o ($80); and 1.p ($61). For each of these accounts,\nApplicant told the investigator that he could not recall any of the specifics about the\naccount, such as when it was opened, when it went delinquent, or if it was only in his\nname. He said he had difficulty remembering the majority of his credit cards and loans.\nHe did not disclose them because he was not familiar with them and thought they were\ntaken care of. He said he would begin making payments when required. He would look\ninto his unpaid debts and pay off the smaller debts as soon as possible and would make\npayment arrangements for his other debts He hoped to have them all paid within a year.\n(GE 2).  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nIn Applicant\u2019s answer to the SOR, he stated the debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b, 1.c, 1.d, 1.f, \nand 1.g, were all in payment plans. SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b, 1.c, 1.d and 1.m have the same collection \ncreditor. A document Applicant provided shows that in July and August 2022 he made \npayments of $58 on one account and $45 or another. He wrote in the margin that the \npayments were applied to SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b and 1.c respectively. He did not provide \ndocumentary evidence that he has payment plans with the collection creditor or any other \npayment agreements. The accounts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b and 1.c are both credit card accounts \nthat went into collection in approximately 2015. He testified that he has been making \nmonthly payments on the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.c since June 2021. He did not provide \ncorroborating documents to show the payments. He provided a document from the \ncollection creditor for the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.b, indicating that a payment of $50.38 would \nbe electronically withdrawn from his account in January 2021 and the balance was \n$4,175. He testified that he had made 51 payments on this debt and the current balance \nwas $3,974. I left the record open to allow him to document the current balance and proof \nof payments for the last six months. No corroborating documents were provided. (Tr. 23-\n26, 28-33, 52-56; GE 2, 3; AE C, D, E) \nApplicant provided a document that shows $52 monthly payments from February \n2022 to August 2022 were paid to a collection law firm. He wrote in the margin of the \ndocument that payments are for the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.d, but no evidence was provided to \ncorroborate that this payment is for that debt. The document does not identify the debt. \nHe testified that he has been making monthly payments since June 2021. He provided a \nletter from March 2021 from the same collection law firm that shows a payment of $200 \nwas applied to a different creditor account. I cannot corroborate that his $52 monthly \npayments were for SOR \u00b6 1.d or whether they were for another debt he is paying through \nthis law firm. He did not provide documentary evidence that he has a payment plan with \nthe collection law firm for SOR \u00b6 1.d.

He wrote comments on the letter that are undiscernible, \nother than noting it was for the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.g. The letter notes the balance owed, \nwhich matches the amount in the SOR. I believe this is the same debt. He testified that \nthe debt is paid, but did not provide documentary evidence to confirm the resolution of \nthe debt. He is given credit for making some payments on the debt. (Tr. 64-65; AE C) \nApplicant provided evidence that he resolved the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.m. It is unknown \nwhen it was paid. He provided evidence that in March 2021 he resolved the debts in SOR \n\u00b6\u00b6 1.n and 1.p. He provided a copy of a medical bill for his wife that showed there was a \nbalance of $99 due in March 2021. He indicated this bill is for the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.o. It is \na different creditor than that alleged in the SOR. It is unresolved. (Tr. 37, 76-80; AE C) \nIn Applicant\u2019s answer to the SOR, he wrote \u201caccount is canceled\u201d for the debts in \n\u00b6\u00b6 1.e, 1.h, 1.i, and 1.k. All of these debts are reported as delinquent and in collection in \nApplicant\u2019s June 2020 credit report. The debt in SOR \u00b6 1.e had a last activity date in 2013 \nand was charged off in March 2014; \u00b6 1.h was charged off in April 2014; \u00b6 1.i was charged \noff in May 2014; and \u00b6 1.k shows the account is with a collection law firm and its last \nactivity date was June 2017. Due to the age of these debts they have likely fallen off of \nApplicant\u2019s more recent credit reports. \nApplicant testified that he contacted the creditor in SOR \u00b6 1.e and was told the \ndebt was either canceled or not valid. He admitted that he did not pay the debt. He said \nthe debt in SOR \u00b6 1.h is valid and he did not pay it. He believes the account is now closed. \nHe acknowledged the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.i and said he reached out to the creditor. He did \nnot pay the debt and believes it was canceled due to its age. (Tr. 59-62, 65-68; GE 3) \nThe debt in SOR \u00b6 1.k is for a collection account for a communication company \nthat went into collection in December 2018. He settled the account in March 2021. (Tr. \n71-72; AE F) \nApplicant provided current copies of credit reports from each of the three credit \nbureaus. Except for his mortgage and the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.k, no other delinquent debts \nare reflected. It is noted that Applicant owes more than $75,000 of student loans that have \nbeen deferred under the government\u2019s moratorium due to the pandemic. He stated that \nhis payments will be approximately $800 a month when the deferment ends. (Tr. 105; AE \nF, G, H) \nThroughout the hearing, Applicant had difficulty identifying the specific accounts \nhe was making a payment towards. Some payments could have been for accounts that \nwere not alleged in the SOR.

He testified that he now has an additional \n$600 withheld from his pay to cover future tax liability. He does not have an installment \nagreement with the IRS for his 2021 tax debt. He explained he sends the IRS money \nwhen he can to apply to his 2021 taxes. He estimated that when he sends money to the \nIRS, it is about $250. He has not contacted the IRS, but he did receive a letter from them \nabout his tax liability. He testified that he did not owe federal income taxes for 2020. (Tr. \n87-93) \nApplicant testified that he withdrew money from his 401(k) for living expenses. He \npaid the tax penalty when he withdrew the funds. He estimated the amount he withdrew \nto be around $2,000. He and his wife have two joint bank accounts. He estimated he has \nabout $250 in one and $500 in the other. He does not have a budget, but tries to put his \nexpenses on a worksheet and keep track of his weekly bills. He has had no financial \ncounseling. He worries about his bills and what to pay and when. He believes he has a \nbetter grasp on his finances. He said he now checks his credit and is more enlightened. \nHe did not begin to address his delinquent debts until 2021. He admitted he and his wife \ndid not pay attention to their bills.

(Tr. 22, 33, 84-87, 93-102) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility, the administrative judge \nmust consider the AG. In addition to brief introductory explanations for each guideline, \nthe adjudicative guidelines list potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating \nconditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified \ninformation. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere \nspeculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 states an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information).  \nAnalysis \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for financial considerations is set out \nin AG \u00b618: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nThe Appeal Board explained the scope and rationale for the financial \nconsiderations security concern in ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012) \n(citation omitted) as follows: \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an applicant might \nknowingly compromise classified information in order to raise money in \nsatisfaction of his or her debts. Rather, it requires a Judge to examine the \ntotality of an applicant\u2019s financial history and circumstances. The Judge \nmust consider pertinent evidence regarding the applicant\u2019s self-control, \njudgment, and other qualities essential to protecting the national secrets as \nwell as the vulnerabilities inherent in the circumstances. The Directive \npresumes a nexus between proven conduct under any of the Guidelines \nand an applicant\u2019s security eligibility.  \nAG \u00b6 19 provides conditions that could raise security concerns. The following are \npotentially applicable: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant has numerous delinquent debts that he began incurring in 2014 and was \nunable to pay. There is sufficient evidence to support the application of the above \ndisqualifying conditions. \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising \nfrom financial difficulties. The following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially \napplicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control;  \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue.  \nApplicant attributed his financial problems to his wife losing her job in 2015 and his \nunderemployment for a period of time. He also experienced short periods of \nunemployment when the contract he was working on was changed. Subsequently, he \nwas unable to pay his mortgage which went into foreclosure. He was able to get a loan \nmodification in 2017, but fell behind again. He missed payments in late 2018 and only \nmade a couple payments in early 2019. The mortgage company would not accept late \npayments and he made no other payments until he received a second loan modification \nin June 2022. \nApplicant was receiving notices from collection companies and was aware he had \ndelinquent debts. He did not provide corroborating evidence that he addressed any of his \ndelinquent debts until after he received the SOR. He provided evidence he paid some \ndebts and made some payments on others, but did not provide evidence that he has \npayment plans with creditors. Although he said that he has been making payments on \nsome debts since 2021, he did not provide corroborating evidence. He said some debts \nwere canceled or recalled. He agreed he was responsible for most of the alleged \ndelinquent debts. \nApplicant is relying on the fact that his current credit reports do not report debts \nthat were alleged in the SOR so his financial situation is improving. Many of the debts are \nmore than seven years old and no longer reportable. \nThe Appeal Board provides a summary regarding \u201cnon-collectable\u201d debts: \nThe security significance of long delinquent debts is not diminished merely \nbecause the debts have become legally unenforceable owing to the \npassage of time. Security clearance decisions are not controlled or limited \nby any statute of limitations, and reliance on the non-collectability of a debt \ndoes not constitute a good-faith effort to resolve that debt within the \nmeaning of the Directive. A security clearance adjudication is not a \nproceeding aimed at collecting an applicant\u2019s personal debts. Rather a \nsecurity clearance adjudication is a proceeding aimed at evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness in making a decision \nabout the applicant\u2019s security eligibility. Accordingly, even if a delinquent \ndebt is legally unenforceable . . . , the federal government is entitled to \nconsider the facts and circumstances surrounding an applicant\u2019s conduct in \nincurring and failing to satisfy the debt in a timely manner.\u201d ISCR Case No. \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n17-01473 (App. Bd. Aug. 10, 2018) quoting ISCR Case No. 10-03656 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Jan 19, 2011) \nApplicant\u2019s reliance on the fact that his current credit report does not show the \ndebts alleged in the SOR, and therefore mitigates the security concerns is misguided. \nApplicant\u2019s current finances are apparently better, as reflected by his recent credit reports. \nApplicant lived in his house close to three years (July 2019-June 2022) and did not pay \nhis mortgage, thereby allowing him to presumably have more expendable income. His \nwages increased in 2018. He did not make an effort to pay his delinquent debts until after \nhe received the SOR in February 2021. \nThe timing of resolution of financial problems is an important factor in evaluating \nan applicant\u2019s case for mitigation, because an applicant who takes action to resolve \nfinancial problems only after being placed on notice his or her clearance is in jeopardy \nmay lack the judgment, and self-discipline to follow rules and regulations over time or \nwhen there is no immediate threat to his or her own interests. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. \n17-03229 at 4 (App. Bd. Jun. 7, 2019). \nI am unable to find that Applicant acted responsibly under the circumstances or \nthat he made good-faith efforts to pay his debts. Applicant was receiving notices from \ncollection agencies, but failed to act until he received the SOR. AG \u00b6 20(b) partially \napplies due to being underemployed prior to 2018 and his wife\u2019s loss of employment. His \nfinancial issues are recent and ongoing because many debts are not resolved. They \ncontinue to cast doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. AG \n\u00b6\u00b6 20(a) is not applicable. \nApplicant has fully paid the debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.m, 1.n, and 1.p. AG \u00b6 20(d) applies \nto these debts. He recently began to pay the debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.f and 1.g, but only has \nmade a few payments. AG \u00b6 20(d) marginally applies to these debts. Applicant has not \nparticipated in financial counseling. Although Applicant may be in a better position \nfinancially, it is because many of his debts were not paid and are now unenforceable. AG \n\u00b6 20(e) does not apply. Despite providing some evidence that he has paid a couple debts \nand has begun paying others, there is insufficient evidence to show his finances are under \ncontrol. There is no evidence he has participated in financial counseling. AG \u00b6 20(c) does \nnot apply. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\n \n \n \n10 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n       \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent \nto which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the \nmotivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, \nexploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or \nrecurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline F in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were \naddressed under that guideline, but some warrant additional comment. \nApplicant began accumulating delinquent debt in 2014. Many of his debts are \nuncollectable due to their age. Although he had some unforeseen circumstances, such \nas his wife losing her job in 2015, his income increased in 2018 and his wife became fully \nemployed around that time. He chose not to begin addressing his delinquent debt until \nafter he received the SOR. Many of his debts are unpaid and unresolved. \nConduct not alleged in the SOR may be considered to assess an applicant\u2019s \ncredibility; to decide whether a particular adjudicative guideline is applicable; to evaluate \nevidence of extenuation, mitigation, or changed circumstances; to consider whether an \napplicant has demonstrated successful rehabilitation; or as part of a whole-person \nanalysis. ISCR Case No. 03-20327 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, 2006) (citations omitted). \nApplicant testified that he owes the IRS $9,000 for tax year 2021 that is unpaid. \nHe has received correspondence from the IRS. He does not have an installment plan. He \nstated he will occasionally send some money to the IRS for this debt. He also has $75,000 \nin student loans that have been deferred due to the pandemic. That moratorium will likely \nend soon, and he will have to start paying back his loan. I have considered these facts in \nevaluating all of the evidence in mitigation and in my whole person analysis of his financial \nissues. \nApplicant did not disclose his numerous delinquent debts on his SCA or when \nasked by the government investigator. He could not recall most of the debts when \nconfronted with them. The record evidence clearly indicates that Applicant has not acted \nresponsibly for many years and has instead chosen to ignore his financial responsibilities \nby asserting that he was unaware of them. Based on his testimony, I am not convinced \nthat Applicant has a responsible grasp on his finances. Applicant has not established a \nreliable financial track record for me to conclude that he will continue to make payments \non debts he recently started to pay or that he will address the delinquent debts that are \nno longer listed on his credit report.

She has worked for \nthis employer since 2004 and has held a secret clearance since March 2010. She was \nmarried in 2005 and divorced in 2013.

Between 2010\u20132016, she had been \nusing marijuana while granted access to classified information. She reported that until \n2013, she had used marijuana recreationally on most weekends. After her divorce, she \nwas using it every day after work and on weekends. This continued until 2016. (Item 3, \n4) \nIn her background interview, Applicant also disclosed that she had used ecstasy, \nmushrooms (psilocybin), and cocaine in the last seven years. She reported that she \nused mushrooms once in about 2016, because she had never tried it. She stated that \nshe had used ecstasy on about twelve occasions, from about 2016 to 2019, while \nattending festivals or concerts.

She admitted in her answer that she \nused ecstasy while granted access to classified information. (Item 4) \nApplicant admitted to the investigator that she had first tried cocaine in November \n2013, while at a party. She continued to use it about six more times over the next \nmonth. After then, she used cocaine most weekends until her driving while intoxicated \n(DWI) arrest in November 2016. She last used cocaine in December 2019. She \nadmitted in her answer that she used cocaine while granted access to classified \ninformation. (Item 4) \nIn her background interview, Applicant was asked about her intent to use drugs \nin the future. She claimed that she does not intend to use marijuana because it is \nexpensive and smelly. She admitted that she would do ecstasy again if it was given to \nher, because it is enjoyable for concerts or festivals. She stated that she will probably \nuse ecstasy about once a year from now on. She also admitted that if cocaine is \navailable, she will use it a couple of times a month. She has friends that provide it to \nher. She claimed that she could abstain from drugs if it threatened her job, and has \nbeen able to abstain in the past because she avoided her friends. She denied future \nintent to use drugs in her answer. (Item 4) \nApplicant failed to report any drug use or drug use while possessing a security \nclearance on her SCA. When asked about her omissions by an investigator, she \nclaimed that she was only thinking of her three years of sobriety, and that she must \nhave mismarked the form. She also stated that she did not know why she answered the \nquestion in that way. (Item 3, 4) \nIn November 2016, Applicant was arrested for DWI. When she was pulled over \nby police at about 4 AM, her blood alcohol content (BAC) was almost double the legal \nlimit of intoxication. She was arrested, and pled guilty to fourth degree driving while \nimpaired. In March 2017, she was sentenced to two years of probation, a 45 day \nsuspended jail sentence, a fine, and attendance at state mandated DWI offender \nclasses. (Item 3, 4, 5) \nAfter her DWI conviction, Applicant attended an outpatient substance abuse \nprogram. She reported on her SCA that she attended from March 2017 to October \n2017. She verified this information in her background interview. SOR \u00b6 2.c listed the \nyear she attended this program as 2016, which appears to be an administrative error. In \nthis program, she attended individual therapy and group therapy once a week. In her \nanswer, she admitted being diagnosed with alcohol use disorder, cannabis use \ndisorder, and cocaine use disorder. (Item 3, 4) \nApplicant reported that her drinking became a problem after her divorce in 2013. \nUntil her DWI arrest, she was binge drinking on weekends.

She stated that she intends to keep \ndrinking because all her friends do it, and she does not want to be excluded from her \nfriends. She claimed that she will able to drink in moderation. (Item 4) \nIn her FORM response, Applicant stated that she was sorry and ashamed, and \nhas been grateful for the privilege to hold a clearance for 12 years. She stated that she \nregrets her offending behavior and understands the damage that drugs can do. She \nasserted that she has worked for her employer for over 17 years, and has been \nmentoring and leading her co-workers for ten years. She stated that she has a history of \nanxiety and depression, and had planned to seek help to continue to address her \nmental health issues, and has been spiritually practicing and seeking guidance. \n(Response) \nPolicies \nIt is well established that no one has a right to a security clearance. As the \nSupreme Court held in Department of the Navy v. Egan, \u201cthe clearly consistent standard \nindicates that security determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d \n484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988). \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(a), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have not drawn inferences grounded on \nmere speculation or conjecture. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nAnalysis \nGuideline H, Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nAG \u00b6 24 expresses the security concern regarding drug involvement: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription drugs, and the use of other substances that can cause \nphysical or mental impairment or are used in a manner inconsistent with \ntheir intended use can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability and \ntrustworthiness, both because such behavior may lead to physical or \npsychological impairment and because it raises questions about a \nperson\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations. \nControlled substance means any \u201ccontrolled substance\u201d as defined in 21 \nU.S.C 802. Substance misuse is the generic term adopted in this guideline \nto describe any of the behaviors listed above. \nI have considered the disqualifying conditions for drug involvement under AG \u00b6 \n25 and the following are potentially applicable: \n(a) any substance misuse (see above definition); \n(d) diagnosis by a duly qualified medical or mental health professional \n(e.g., physician, clinical psychologist, psychiatrist, or licensed clinical \nsocial worker) of substance use disorder; \n(f) any illegal drug use while granted access to classified information or \nholding a sensitive position; and  \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(g) expressed intent to continue drug involvement and substance misuse, \nor failure to clearly and convincingly commit to discontinue such misuse. \nThe Controlled Substances Act (\u201cCSA\u201d) makes it illegal under Federal law to \nmanufacture, possess, or distribute certain drugs (Controlled Substances Act, 21 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 801, et seq. See \u00a7 844). All controlled substances are classified into five schedules, \nbased on their accepted medical uses, their potential for abuse, and their psychological \nand physical effects on the body. \u00a7\u00a7811, 812. Marijuana, ecstasy, and mushrooms \n(Psilocybin) are classified as Schedule I controlled substances, \u00a7812(c), based on its \nhigh potential for abuse, no accepted medical use, and no accepted safety for use in \nmedically supervised treatment. \u00a7812(b)(1). Cocaine is classified as a Schedule II \ncontrolled substance based on its high potential for abuse, with use potentially leading \nto severe psychological or physical dependence. \u00a7812(b)(2). \nApplicant admitted in her answer that she used marijuana, ecstasy, and cocaine \nwhile granted access to classified information. She also admitted using marijuana for \nabout nine years prior as well. She was diagnosed with cannabis and cocaine use \ndisorders. Applicant told the background investigator that she intended to continue to \nuse ecstasy and cocaine. AG \u00b6\u00b6 25(a), 25(d), 25(f), and 25(g) apply. \nI have considered the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 26. The following are \npotentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this \nproblem, and has established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not \nlimited to: (1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; (2) \nchanging or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; and (3) \nproviding a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug involvement \nand substance misuse, acknowledging that any future involvement is \ngrounds for revocation of national security eligibility; and  \n(d) satisfactory completion of a prescribed drug treatment program, including, but \nnot limited to, rehabilitation and aftercare requirements, without recurrence of \nabuse, and a favorable prognosis by a duly qualified medical professional. \nApplicant used cocaine and ecstasy as recently as 2019. This drug involvement \nis recent, and is part of a larger pattern of illegal drug use going back 21 years. She did \nnot state in her answer or response that her drug use has completely stopped, and she \ndetailed the likelihood of future use in her background interview. There is insufficient \nevidence in the record showing that her drug use occurred under circumstances that are \nunlikely to recur.

AG \u00b6 26(a) does not apply. \nApplicant failed to provide sufficient evidence to find that she has overcome her \nuse of illegal drugs, or established a pattern of abstinence from her most recent illegal \ndrug use. Applicant used illegal drugs while possessing a security clearance for at least \nnine years. Applicant admitted to using these drugs with friends and at music festivals. \nShe provided no evidence that she has disassociated from her drug-using friends, and \nno longer attends events where illegal drugs are present. Furthermore, she did not \nprovide a signed statement agreeing to abstain from future illegal drug use. While she \ngets some credit for abstaining for two years, she started using drugs again after her \ncannabis and cocaine use disorder diagnoses. AG \u00b6 26(b) does not apply. \nIn her answer, Applicant admitted to being diagnosed with alcohol, cannabis, and \ncocaine use disorder. While she voluntarily attended an outpatient substance abuse \nprogram for several months, she has gone back to using illegal drugs and alcohol, \ndespite her diagnoses. She failed to provide sufficient evidence of following treatment \nrecommendations, or rehabilitation and aftercare requirements, and she has not \nprovided prognoses from a qualified medical professional. AG \u00b6 26(d) does not apply. \nApplicant made a commitment to the government and her employer not to use \nillegal drugs when she initially applied for a security clearance. She was put on notice \nthat illegal drug use is not permitted while possessing a security clearance, as there is \nan entire section of the SCA that asks about \u201cIllegal Use of Drugs or Drug Activity.\u201d \nSimilarly, Applicant was asked by a government investigator about illegal drug use \nduring her background interview. She admitted her intent to use illegal drugs in the \nfuture with friends and at concerts and music festivals. Her drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse clearly outweighs her professional commitments and responsibilities. \nApplicant\u2019s drug use is recent and it occurred while she held a security clearance. She \ncannot be trusted to follow the rules and regulations required to handle and protect \nclassified information. \nThe Appeal Board has held that \u201ca person who broke a promise to abide by drug \nlaws after having been placed on notice that drug use is not compatible with access to \nclassified information has not demonstrated the quantum of reliability expected of those \nwith access to classified information.\u201d ISCR Case No. 16-03460 at 4 (App. Bd.

She attended a substance abuse \nprogram in 2017, and was diagnosed with alcohol use disorder. AG \u00b6\u00b6 22(a), 22(c), and \n22(d) apply. \nI have considered the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 23. The following are \npotentially applicable: \n(a) so much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or it happened \nunder such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast \ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or judgment; \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her pattern of maladaptive alcohol use, \nprovides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and has \ndemonstrated a clear and established pattern of modified consumption or \nabstinence in accordance with treatment recommendations; and \n(d) the individual has successfully completed a treatment program along with any \nrequired aftercare, and has demonstrated a clear and established pattern of \nmodified \nconsumption \nor \nabstinence \nin \naccordance \nwith \ntreatment \nrecommendations. \nApplicant has a history of binge drinking, and incurred a single DWI arrest in \nNovember 2016. She has not had any other incidents of DWI. She voluntarily attended \na substance abuse program after her conviction in 2017. Despite her alcohol use \ndisorder diagnosis and two and a half years of sobriety, she has resumed drinking \nalcohol. While Applicant claims that she now drinks in moderation, she did not provide \nsufficient evidence to show that her past alcohol abuse occurred under circumstances \nthat are unlikely to recur, or that it no longer casts doubt on her current reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or judgment.

However, since she started drinking alcohol again, she did not provide \nsufficient evidence showing that she established a pattern of modified alcohol \nconsumption or that she has complied with her specific treatment recommendations \nafter her alcohol use disorder diagnosis. AG \u00b6\u00b6 23(b) and 23(d) do not fully apply. \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \nAG \u00b6 15 details the personal conduct security concern: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes\u2026 \nI have considered the disqualifying conditions for drug involvement under AG \u00b6 \n16 and the following are potentially applicable \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or \nsimilar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment \nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine national security \neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities. \nIn her answer, Applicant admitted to falsifying her April 2019 SCA when she \nfailed to report her illegal drug use or involvement with drugs while possessing a \nsecurity clearance. Her explanation to her background investigator for not truthfully \nanswering this question is not credible. She was able to provide the investigator with \ndetailed information about years of use of illegal drug use while possessing a security \nclearance. Her failure to truthfully answer this question on her 2019 SCA was a \ndeliberate falsification. AG \u00b6 16(a) applies. \nI have considered the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 17. The following is \npotentially applicable: \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment. \nApplicant deliberately failed to report her illegal drug use and drug involvement \nwhile possessing a security clearance on her 2019 SCA.

She \nfailed to provide sufficient evidence showing that her failure to truthfully fill out her SCA \noccurred under circumstances unlikely to recur. AG \u00b6 17(c) does not apply. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the \npotentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and \ncircumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuidelines H, G, and E in my whole-person analysis. \nIn this case, Applicant offered little whole-person evidence to consider. Applicant \nbroke her commitment to the government and to her employer to abstain from illegal \ndrug use while possessing a security clearance and lied about it on her SCA. Her \ncontinued alcohol use, and expressed intent to use illegal drugs shows that she is not \nwilling or able to control her substance abuse issues, and she puts her social life before \nher professional responsibilities. She does not possess the judgment, trustworthiness, \nand reliability to handle or protect classified information. \nApplicant did not provide sufficient evidence to mitigate the drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, alcohol consumption, and personal conduct security concerns. \nApplicant failed to clearly and convincingly commit to discontinue future drug \ninvolvement. All of this continues to cast doubt on her reliability, trustworthiness, and \ngood judgment with respect to her eligibility for a security clearance. Overall, the record \nevidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security \nclearance. \n10 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n____________________________ \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline H:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a - 1.g: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline G:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 2.a: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 2.b - 2.d: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 3, Guideline E:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 3.a: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIt is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant a security \nclearance.

(Tr. \n24-30; GE 1, 2) \nIn the SOR, the Government alleged Applicant\u2019s five delinquent debts totaling \napproximately $26,000. These delinquencies consisted of a credit card, personal loans, \nand telecommunications debts. Applicant admitted all of the SOR allegations with \nadditional comment, with the exception of SOR \u00b6 1.c. He denied this debt and claimed \nthat it was a duplicate of another debt alleged in the SOR. His admissions are adopted \nas findings of fact. (Answer; GE 1-7) \nApplicant attributed his financial issues to his employer\u2019s loss of a government \ncontract in May 2017 that saw his salary reduced from $80,000 to $35,000, annually. As \na result of his drop in income, he could not afford to pay all of his creditors and he \ndefaulted on some of his financial obligations. He began working for his current \nemployer in June 2018, and earned about $50,000 annually. At the time of the hearing, \nhe earned between $51,000 and $52,000, annually. He takes home about $1,700 every \ntwo weeks. He also earns $1,200 per month form his military retirement. His wife earns \nabout $23,000 to $24,000, annually. He claimed that once he obtained his current \nemployment, he earned a sufficient income to begin resolving his delinquent debts. In \nAugust 2019, he hired a law firm to help him resolve his delinquencies. He claimed that \nhe paid this law firm $6,000 in monthly installments and that they owe him money back \nbecause he paid the debt listed in SOR \u00b6 1.b without the law firm\u2019s assistance. He \nclaimed that he began resolving his financial delinquencies prior to being evaluated for \na clearance. (Tr. 22-23, 30-34, 39, 46-47; Answer; AE A-I; GE 1, 2) \nApplicant has no written budget that he follows. He has about $800 left over at \nthe end of each month after paying his bills that he puts into savings in order to pay off \nhis creditors through the aforementioned law firm. He has about $4,000 in savings, but \ndoes not have a retirement account. He claims he is working very hard to pay his \ndelinquent debts. However, this year, he bought a 2022 truck for about $70,000 and a \n2022 motorcycle for about $30,000.1 He claimed that he purchased the truck because \nhe was having mechanical issues with his old vehicle, and he purchased the motorcycle \nbecause it gets good gas mileage. He pays $1,000 per month on the truck and $600 per \nmonth for the motorcycle. (Tr. 42-44, 50-54) \n1 Any adverse information not alleged in the SOR, such as Applicant\u2019s spending on motor vehicles or any \nadditional delinquent accounts, cannot be used for disqualification purposes. It may be considered when \nassessing the application of mitigating conditions and for the whole-person analysis. \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe $14,357 credit card alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.a has not been resolved. Applicant \nopened this account in 2015 to make upgrades on his home and to pay for living \nexpenses. The last payment he made on this account was in November 2017. He had a \ncivil court hearing related to this account scheduled for November 2, 2022. He said that \nafter this date, he will have a better understanding as to how to resolve this account. \nOne of the options he is considering to resolve this account is to allow the statute of \nlimitations to run on it. He also may resolve it through payments. He is allowing the \ncreditor\u2019s collection actions to inform him how or whether to resolve this account. (Tr. \n34-39; Answer; GE 2, 3, 4, 6, 7; AE A, B, G, I) \nThe $6,121 credit card alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.b has been resolved. This account \nbecame delinquent in 2017, when Applicant suffered a reduction in income. The credit \nconsolidation company helped him resolve this debt through a wage garnishment. The \naccount was settled no later than October 2021. (Tr. 39-41, 47-52; Answer; GE 1-6; AE \nA, B, D, G) \nThe $5,869 credit card alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.c has not been established. This debt \nwas held by the same creditor as the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.b with a similar balance. The only \ncredit report showing two delinquent accounts to this creditor listed Applicant\u2019s \ncollections accounts twice. No other credit report in evidence shows that Applicant has \ntwo accounts with this creditor. Throughout the investigation process, Applicant has \nmaintained that he only had one delinquent account with this creditor. Based on the \nforegoing, I find that the debt listed in SOR \u00b6 1.c is a duplicate of the debt described in \nSOR \u00b6 1.b. (Tr. 41, 47-49; Answer; GE 1-6; AE A, B, D, G) \nThe $520 telecommunications debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.d has not been resolved. \nApplicant claimed that he would eventually settle this debt, but is waiting until after he \nresolves his other, larger delinquent debts. (Tr. 41, 52-54; Answer; GE 2, 3, 5; AE G) \nThe $90 telecommunications debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.e has been resolved. This \naccount became delinquent when Applicant switched cell phone providers and did not \npay the full balance on his former provider\u2019s account. He settled this account through \npayment no later than September 2021. (Tr. 41; Answer; GE 2-6; AE F, G) \nApplicant settled a delinquent debt not alleged in the SOR for $2,000 no later \nthan December 2019. He has an additional delinquent debt not listed in the SOR for \nabout $6,700 that is the subject of a civil lawsuit. (GE 7; AE B, I) \nApplicant called his supervisor as a witness. His supervisor is a facility security \nofficer and a security manager for the government contractor where they both work. \nApplicant\u2019s supervisor interacts with Applicant regularly and he believes Applicant is \nhonest, trusts Applicant's judgment, and believes that Applicant should have a security \nclearance.

In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \n4 \n\n \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant had four delinquent debts totaling about $20,000 that he had been \ndelinquent on since about 2017. The evidence is sufficient to raise AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and \n19(c), thereby shifting the burden to Applicant to provide evidence in mitigation. \nFor the aforementioned reasons, the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.c has not been \nestablished. I find in favor of Applicant with respect to that allegation. \nConditions that could mitigate the financial considerations security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 20. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred\nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast\ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good\njudgment; \n \n \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control; and \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nWhile Applicant has resolved the debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b and 1.e through payments, \nthe debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.d remain unresolved. He also has another delinquent \ndebt that was not alleged in the SOR. His financial issues are ongoing and I cannot find \nthey are unlikely to recur. AG \u00b6 20(a) does not apply. \nApplicant\u2019s financial issues arose as a result of a loss of employment and \nunderemployment from 2017 until mid-2018. These conditions were beyond his control. \nHe must also show that he acted responsibly under the circumstances with respect to \nthese debts. While he hired a law firm to assist him in settling his delinquencies, he \nfailed to meaningfully address two of the SOR debts (including the largest). Despite \nhaving unaddressed SOR and other delinquencies, he also further indebted himself in \n2022 for an additional $130,000 through what can only be described as gratuitous \nspending. AG \u00b6 20(b) does not apply. \nDespite resolving two of the SOR debts though payment, Applicant\u2019s failure to \nresolve his remaining SOR and other delinquent debts makes AG \u00b6 20(d) only partly \napplicable. Even if the law firm he hired provided financial counseling and was a \nlegitimate and credible source thereof, the lack of meaningful resolution of his overall \ndelinquencies makes AG \u00b6 20(c) inapplicable because he has not shown that his \nfinancial problems are being resolved or are under control. \nAs none of the mitigating factors is fully applicable, Applicant\u2019s financial issues \ncontinue to cast doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. The \nfinancial considerations security concerns are not mitigated. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an\napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n \n(1) The nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. I have also considered \nApplicant\u2019s military service and his positive character reference from his supervisor. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude Applicant did not \nmitigate the financial considerations security concerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 1.a: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.b-1.c: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.d: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.e: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIt is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for \na security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nBenjamin R. Dorsey \nAdministrative Judge \n7 \n",
